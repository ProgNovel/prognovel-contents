title: Evil Rogue Nalaq
---

The Yashura was a normal family in Badril Village, Norman’s investigations concluded to this. Yet the pair of Yurin cousins believed Yashura was anything but normal, simply because Mama Ross said so.

On break from the meeting, Merly took an excuse to stroll Yashura Family’s place. The girl declined Patriarch Shuro’s offer to get a maidservant to accompany her, saying she could just ask direction to whoever she met when needed. She wasn’t alone, however, Mama Ross was inside her. Because the awkward mood from earlier, Patriarch Shuro and his family readily agreed, unaware that Mama Ross took the chance to investigate Yashura Family from inside out.

“The ancient defensive formation’s heart should be around here,” Mama Ross whispered inside Merly’s mind. No one was around when they just arrived in Yashura Family’s garden.

“Are you sure they have that kind of formation, Mama Ross?” Merly asked hesitantly, “they don’t seem the sophisticated kind.”

“The current generation maybe simple, but their origin definitely not,” Mama Ross explained. “The fact that no experts guarding the family means their history is thinning out. Maybe the only real expert that living the standard of ancient Yashura is that Jhuro child Norman talked before.”

“The kid’s father…” Merly mumbled.

“Patriarch Shuro’s still in his prime age, there’s still a chance for him to get an heir from his own blood. Yet, even though his talent is hopeless, Shira Yashura’s position as the next patriarch is very stable. We should get Jhuro Yashura investigated to decide whether or not Yashura Family should be befriended.”

“Yes.”

Merly had been in a conversation with Mama Ross the entire time. If anyone was beside the girl then, they’d only see the girl talked alone to empty air.

Mama Ross confirmed that the so-called Good-Natured Spirit wasn’t exactly a good fella, thus getting Young Master Shira Yashura into their Blue Robe Society was impossible. But Jerrin indicated he got interested in making a contact between the Yashura and Yurin, because they’d heard Norman spoke many good things about the man called Jhuro Yashura. In addition, Mama Ross also just discovered the formation she felt even before entering Badril Village actually came from this very garden. If the result of their investigation resulted in sactifactionary, then continuing their relationship with Yashura Family wouldn’t be a bad thing.

“Mm, if Jerrin couldn’t get contracted with a Nalaq till he’s in his thirty, getting to know families and clans with ancient histories will help him get his chance for a patriarch seat instead,” Mama Ross said after a thought.

“Thank you for helping my cousin all this time, Mama Ross,” Merly whispered, recalled Jerrin’s position as the family head’s successor was pretty bad before Mama Ross’s soul revived as a Nalaq.

“I didn’t do much except for giving my approval, my dear. That child Jerrin already preparing a backup plan if his career in Blue Robe Society gets stuck. Knowing his personality, how could I not helping him?” Mama Ross sighed. Between Patriarch Yurin’s three sons, Mama Ross favored the youngest, Jerrin, who always eager to do menial tasks for her and Merly even though he had the position of senior disciple brother. “Anyway, that formation, I felt it resonating a bit from that direction. Go over there, Merly my dear.”

What welcoming them was statue of a lion. Cracks were apparent on its moldy surface, yet the fierce roar the lion bragged suggested its unwillingness being defeated by the flow of time. Mama Ross couldn’t tell the exact year the statue being built, but the knowledge of an exhausting study about ancient Formations during her time helped her to guess the lion statue’s age. The venerable Nalaq found the lingering _mana_ injected into the statue almost one hundred years old.

Appearing out from Merly’s body, Mama Ross continued to study the lion statue with her brows knitted.

“Quite unexpected. There are at least seven different minor supportive formations installed after the main defensive Formation!”

Merly didn’t know about Art of Formation that much. But she could feel Mama Ross’s faint gasp of surprise, she instantly knew this finding was a big deal. “Is that very good, Mama Ross?”

“At least today we know Yashura Family had a Formation genius two to three generations ago,” Mama Ross said solemnly. If Yurin Family could get a peek on this Formation genius’s legacy, Mama Ross wouldn’t be so worried about the two Yurin children whom she already took under her wings. “The mana applied is almost one hundred years old. But I suspect this statue way older than that; look here, Merly, the mana cast on the statue is seeped deep into the stone. One method to prolong a Formation’s lifespan is to cast it on an ancient object. And the mana applied seems to be layered, maybe someone has used it for something else before this statue became the heart of defensive Formation.”

Merly asked, “Mama Ross means they have another secret like this? I heard there’s a well-respected bank goes with the name Yashura World Bank in the west of Tiramikal Continent. Is this family connected to them in some way?”

“I haven’t had the chance to study recent history since my revival, my dear. There’s a possibility the Yashura branched out in the past and made themselves rooted in different places, but it’s not our concern for now,” Mama Ross waved her hand gently. “Go try use your magic item to identify the mystery behind this Formation, Merly my dear. Leaning one or two about ancient spell is very beneficial for your current progress.”

Ever since she made the contract with Mama Ross, Merly never once hesitated doing whatever the lady Nalaq asked her to do. This time was no different. The Yurin girl immediately took out a wristband from her **Mystic Bag**, the kind that glow eerie light upon injected with little bit of mana. The wristband was a magic item, specialized in casting support skills related to Specialist Class, of which usually used to gather information from object or person by reading the subtle data from their flow of mana.

Just when Merly began activating the wristband…

“This Young Lady Yurin, the statue you want to play with is too dirty. It’s too humble for young lady to play with. Please allow this old servant clean it for you first.”

Not only Merly, even Mama Ross was started by the sudden voice intruding from behind. They whirled their body around, found an old butler smiled a serene smile. It was Yulong.

Startled a few steps back both at the same time, Mama Ross and Merly had their tongue tied as they watched Yulong approached the old lion statue. The pair couldn’t take their eyes off from the old butler, and they couldn’t say anything either.

The lady Nalaq was indignant knowing someone dared to sneakily hid behind them. There was no way an experienced Mage like Mama Ross, although long ceased to live, to be unaware someone standing behind unless the other party intentionally suppressed their presence--Mama Ross would suffer a thousand deaths if she was that sloppy back in her time. Haplessly, they witnessed without protest as Yulong, still keeping his professional butler poise, unhurriedly brushed the moss off from the statue’s surface.

Knowing that the guest awkwardly stared at him, Yulong turned toward the dumbfounded Merly and said politely, “It might take a while to clean this statue, Young Lady Yurin. Perhaps, the flower garden in the west wing suits you best rather than this old uncared place. You should be more careful next time when visiting unknown places.”

Now it was Merly’s turn to get angry at the kind-looking old butler. Mama Ross too harrumphed as if she knew Yulong could see her despite not making herself visible to ordinary eyes. Though his words were polite, it was clear he intended to get rid of them. Mama Ross told Merly to go back and not making trouble in front this seemingly powerless butler who didn’t have any level and class.

“That butler is trouble,” Mama Ross whispered when they already far away. “I can’t see any mana inside him. Any living being should have at least trace of mana, even if they never use it their entire life.”

As if she understood Mama Ross’s worry, Merly’s mind searching back of the stories she heard from her cousin Jerrin, stories about criminals and psychopaths who spent a great deal of effort and resources to hide their real power and mana so that they could blend amongst the peer of commonfolks. When the first time that butler greeted them at the Yashura Family’s gate, Mama Ross told Merly to be vigilant of him--now she knew why.

Patriarch Shuro Yashura and his daughter Mila were accompanying the male guests on the courtyard, chatting while standing in circle with hands holding glasses of _tuak_. Even though they were embarrassing themselves during the talks before, one shouldn’t underestimated how thick the pair father and daughter’s faces were--they laughed and joked carefreely as if nothing had happened.

Merly and Mama Ross came back, and they wanted Jerrin and Norman to join them stroll the spacious Yashura Family’s place. Both the men who were called understood that something had happened from seeing the concerned look on Merly’s face.

“Strange? The old butler?” Jerrin rubbed his chin hearing Merly’s concern--Mama Ross, who hadn’t come out from her body to preserve mana, let the girl did the talking after they pulled Jerrin and Norman to a safe place away from prying eyes. Jerrin then hummed again as he thought of something, saying, “A butler who looks like coming from a noble family but working here instead already strange. And from the name the butler doesn’t sound like coming from the west, either.”

“No, not that kind of strange,” Merly shook her head. “Mama Ross feels no presence of mana coming out from that butler.”

“What?” Jerrin knitted his brows, he worked on Blue Robe Society’s External Relations Department for two years and had been aware ugly cases where bad people hid their real power and covered their identity, “is he hiding from someone or something?”

Norman witnessed Merly’s strange behaviour back when Yulong greeted them at the gate. For the lady Nalaq to be vigilant against the harmless-looking old butler was already within expectations. “Young Lady Merly, is there anything this servant can help you with?”

“Mama Ross said uncovering the background of the butler named Yulong and Shira Yashura’s father, Jhuro Yashura, is a priority for us to make a decision regarding Yashura Family,” Merly slowly said, then she delivered the words Mama Ross said within her mind to the coachman, “Norman, how much do you know about these two people?”

“If this about Sir Jhuro Yashura, I happen to know a bit and heard some rumors, I can write another report about him in detail,” Norman took a beat, seemed to be hesitating, “but for the old butler… apart from the fact he hails from Young Master Shira’s mother’s entourage fifteen years ago, there’s no other peculiar information about him.”

Butler Yulong’s record was clean and straight, always keeping his job in order and never made mistakes. Apparently, Patriarch Shuro liked him greatly, giving him many responsibilities of the inner Yashura Family matters even though the Mossack people hadn’t had any experiences hiring webstern-style butlers.

“Mm.” Merly hummed, closing her eyes. Jerrin and Norman waited for her as they knew the girl was communicating with the lady Nalaq inside her body. A moment later, she opened her eyes, declaring Mama Ross’s intention as if she was a revered envoy, “Norman, you uncover Butler Yulong’s past before we leave the village.”

“Understood, Young Lady Merly.”

Investigating a person with a clean background wasn't an easy thing to do. However, since Mama Ross gave the order herself, then Norman had no choice other than succeeding. His real masters were Merly’s and Jerrin’s fathers, thus he’d do anything in his reach so that the two little masters of his kept receiving the lady Nalaq’s favor.

“Merly, do we need to consult this with Teacher Barront?” Jerrin asked.

Merly shook her head. For this matter, she didn’t need to ask Mama Ross, since the Nalaq already said before pulling Jerrin and Norman that they needed someone to entertain the host. It was no good for the guests to minding their own business if the host being polite with them. After all, the Yurins might need to befriend this Yashura Family if the investigations turned out to be good.

“Teacher Barront is the one who can humor Patriarch Yashura. So we don’t need to bother him. Let’s just focus on the butler and the kid’s father,” Merly said. She had made herself comfortable with calling the shot since the others respected Mama Ross inside of her. After that Merly told both the men what Mama Ross and her discovered in Yashura Family’s old garden. Jerrin Yurin’s eyes shone upon hearing the mysterious ancient Formation and the prospect of old Formation genius’s legacy.

Even though they didn’t get the third disciple Sir Baront wanted, Jerrin and Merly haste journeyed to Badril Village wasn’t a wasted matter indeed.

They walked back to regroup with their teacher. As soon as they saw the Patriarch Shuro and his daughter Mila, Jerrin with a big smile congratulating the other party, “Patriarch Yashura, I heard your family is a hidden master in the art of Formation. Why don’t we discuss about it sometimes?”

“Haha! What hidden master, Young Master Jerrin, you’re overestimating us common village folks!” Patriarch Shuro humbly dismissed the remark with a hearty laugh. He then coughed, leaning to his daughter Mila and whispered, “Girl, what’s this _Formation_ thingy he’s talking about?”

“The fuck would I know?!” Mila whispered back impatiently. “Am I looked like a geek like that kid Shira?”

Patriarch Shuro pretended he didn’t hear what Mila said and continued laughing. He said to Jerrin, “Young Master Jerrin, you just need to find my nephew Shira if you have something complicated to discuss, he’s the smartest of us villagers!”

Shira was the only one in Yashura Family who actually read books. The simple-minded pair father and daughter threw the hot ball to him whenever this kind of problem arose. Jerrin and others good-naturedly nodded even though the sneaky whispers didn’t escaped their ears. The pair’s face indeed as thick as Yashura Family’s legendary sturdy wall.

Speaking of Shira, he came back after he said he was going to bring the rogue Nalaq with him. He returned alone.

“Shira my boy, what’s taking you so long?” Patriarch Shuro asked.

Shira replied, “The Nalaq asked for red roses, and he wanted to meet Esteemed Madame Ross in a secluded shed, so I needed a few while preparing those.”

“What for?”

Shira shrugged. “Don’t know. Didn’t ask.” More accurately, he didn’t _want to_ ask.

“It doesn’t matter,” Merly butted in. “Against a low-leveled rogue Nalaqs, a warning from Mama Ross is suffice to make them run between their tails. It doesn’t matter if they’re preparing a trap or not.”

So the other party thought Good-Natured Spirit was setting a trap. That’s good, it was better for Shira if they misunderstood--that way, he didn’t need to explain the matter about the shady candle-lit room, out-of-place bed of roses, and a certain Good-For-Nothing Spirit playing guitar.

Merly then ordered Shira to lead her to the shed where the two Nalaqs supposed to meet. The boy sighed, didn’t know whether the girl or the Nalaq inside her the one who was rude to him this time. But it didn’t matter, in the end, even that cocky Good-Natured Spirit didn’t worth a penny on the esteemed guests’ eyes. He felt bad thinking Good-Natured Spirit would get rejected and would get rid off. He still felt bad about his primary source of income that would soon disappear.

Shira sighed again.

“Stop sighing,” Merly barked as she followed behind the boy.

Shira turned his head and smiled wryly, he didn’t say anything. The girl didn’t have anyone to accompany her, except for him and the lady Nalaq inside her. He began to think if these people really did underestimated Good-Natured Spirit.

“Shouldn’t we brought more people?” he asked cautinously.

“Mama Ross already scared enough low-leveled Nalaqs she an expert on it. Let’s not waste anyone’s time,” Merly said, knitting her brows.

This was the girl he talking with, not the Nalaq, Shira realized. But he didn’t understand why she got angry with such little thing. Shira just shrugged it and thought the girl didn’t like him from the start. Thus he didn’t say any unnecessary words. They were already close to the secluded shed anyway.

“That is the place where the Nalaq is waiting,” Shira said as he pointed out a nice little shed that seemingly ordinary. Then he coughed, saying, “Be careful… he might prepare something… unexpected.”

Mama Ross came out from Merly’s body. Looking at the awkward Shira, she waved her hand, saying, “Thank you for your concern, child. A Nalaq’s threat might scare you since you’ve been living all your life in a small village like this. However, I’m already getting used to a life in the great war; setting a little trap is futile against me.”

With his eyes blinking, Shira clasped his wrist, tried very hard to look innocent and pretending to know nothing about the near future trouble that he worried might happen. When Mama Ross realized the weird expression on the boy’s face, she waved her hand dismissively.

“Nothing will happen. If that rogue Nalaq is smart, he’d be obedient move away after we talk like two civilized Nalaqs,” Mama Ross said confidently.

Shira nodded with a smile that became even more wry than the smile he had previously. Mama Ross and Merly already said their pieces, naturally they wouldn’t want to waste time convincing a boy they only knew less than a day that everything would be alright.

“Merly, wait here with this Yashura child. Giving a warning to this rogue Nalaq should take around five minutes, I’ll be quick,” Mama Ross said as she ruffled Merly’s hair.

“Yes, Mama Ross.”

Then Mama Ross floated away toward the secluded shed’s direction. Soon, her transparent figure seeped into the wooden plank door. Nobody except her and Good-Natured Spirit was inside.

_JREEENGG!!!_

A crisp noise of a guitar being strummed from inside was heard immediately after Mama Ross entered. It transitioned seamlessly into an energizing, unapologetic Spanish guitar melody.

_Jreng jeeng jreng jeng jreeng..._

No angry arguments could be heard from inside, quiet except for Good-Natured Spirit trying to hit on Mama Ross with his corny romantic guitar melody. It was peaceful unlike what Shira worried beforehand. However, just when Shira about to pat his chest in relief, the shed suddenly exploded.

_BBOOOOOOOMMMM!!!_

***

It wasn’t that long since a loud explosion came from Yashura Family, the explosion made the village shook yet again. The Village Head, who was in Elzhier Family doing trivial daily paper job, turned his head at the source of explosion.

“Again? What happened in Yashura Family?!”

Even in Malikh Family, the forever carefree Lyla Blackwood who previously was busy coaxing the proud bunny with carrots, swiftly sprang back to Bhela, shocked by the sudden explosion.

“What was that Sistah?! What was that!!!” Lyla cried as she leaped into Bhela’s embrace.

Bhela’s face was solemn as she tried to guess what had happened. Then, looking at Lyla’s scaredy eyes, she said slowly, “Someone who made contract with evil is being punished by karma. You should remember this to not following their foolish step, Lyla.”

Lyla, who had her mind half-occupied with the now fleeing bunny, nodded her head even though she didn’t fully understand. Bhela brought the noble girl indoor as to not minding about the explosion that had nothing to do with Malikh Family.

Back to Yashura Family, the secluded meeting place where now bushes and trees being swallowed by raging flames. Choked in thick flying dust, Shira lifted his head from kissing dirt. Near him, Merly Yurrin stared at the burning shed dazedly with a glint of righteous fury seen on her eyes.

Shira followed the girl’s gaze toward the source of the madness, yet could see nothing but raging fire. In the center of it, Good-Natured Spirit’s voice could be heard: “Whoa, whoa there, big boobs lady, let’s try to talk this out in civilized manner, okay…”

Suddenly, the licking flames that arose with the tall of adult males began to get sucked in single direction, unfolding the two ethereal silhouettes in the midst of it all: a suave, hairy chest revealing Good-Natured Spirit hugging a guitar with a stalk of red rose he bit between his teeth, and a fireball channeling Mama Ross, who was very mad and now busy trying to kill him.

_BOOOOMMM!!!_

The fireball exploded even more shocking than the one from before. When Shira lifted his head again this time, not only the shed ruined by the swallowing fire, the thick, sturdy wall that had been the pride of Yashura Family for a hundred years, that been said could defend against one thousand type of monsters, had its most sturdy part blasted by the blind fireball Mama Ross thrown.

Shira couldn’t help but to suck a deep breath. It only could described madness happening all around him. The most shocking of all of this was, even though Mama Ross attacked him with tremendous destructive power, Good-Natured Spirit dodgedly disappeared for a brief moment then suddenly popped out beside the tongue-tied Mama Ross, unschated.

“Now, now, beautiful lady, being fierce is okay, but too much of it you’ll ruin your beauty. Let’s calm down and talk about peace and love, okay?” his husky whisper rang beside Mama Ross’s ear, while sneakily, his hand had been groping her butt.

Mama Ross’s pupil shrank. She had long been dead, and had long forgotten how fast and deadly the guy’s move could be.

“Hufff!” exploding the mana she reserved these past three years, Mama Ross engulfed her spiritual being with living flame, she immediately broke free from Good-Natured Spirit’s blatant sexual assault, and while doing so, made a whip with her fire elemental mana and flashed it onto Good-Natured Spirit’s face.

Hissing, Good-Natured Spirit remarked, “Fierce!”

The woman who used to be one of the pillars that supervised Tiramikal Continent was by no means weak. Even when she revived as a Nalaq, and she could only manifest one-fourth of her past power with the help of the contract she made with Merly Yurin, the whip she created with the intent of blasting the shameless rogue Nalaq’s face only leave a shallow whipping mark. Good-Natured Spirit even smirked as he rubbed his whipped face.

The fury in her eyes shimmered no longer; it burst out along with her abundance enmity. The magical flame that gulfing her body began to seep inside, coloring her entire ethereal body with the color of fiery ember.

“Mama Ross!” Merly cried, trying to call her name and make her return to her normal calm Mama Ross. The inexperienced Merly was at loss; the position of the contractor of Mama Ross made it known that the lady Nalaq was planning to burn herself along with the evil, vulgar Nalaq with the guitar.

“What to do? I just touch you a little, beautiful big boobs lady, no need to get serious!” Even Good-Natured Spirit couldn’t help but complain to seek justice--which very much he didn’t deserve.

The flaming Mama Ross arose into the air. Like a rising sun she shone her fire elemental affinity mana like the ancient idol in stories. 

Shira was thunderstruck. It seemed Mama Ross was going to release an awesome fire skill that would blast Good-For-Nothing Spirit for good. However… did the mad lady Nalaq considered Merly and him also was inside her firing range?

Not far from where Shira was crouching from danger, he saw Merly kneeling with her head lowered, expression serene, seemingly to beg for miracle yet accepting whatever calamity that would descend upon her at the same time.

“Fool!” although Shira didn’t like the girl, as a pure Mossack descendant as he was, he absolutely wouldn’t let the most taboo event befall his Yashura Family; a Mossack, even if it would kill him, wouldn’t let a guest die in his own yard lest a terrible luck would descend upon his bloodline in the future generations.

Therefore, moving his untalented body as a Novice, Shira sprang from his hiding position, grabbing the Young Lady Yurin by the hip, and started to escape to a cover.

“Release me, you little swine!” Merly screamed, “I need to channel my mana for Mama Ross!”

So the reason for the lady Nalaq could cast a spell this powerful was because this girl provided her with raw mana. Shira’s expression darkened. Although he had the slightest virtue of ancient Mossack to respect and protect one’s guests, he wasn’t a fool himself who would be washing his own neck while the other person sharpening their executing blade. 

Shira had decided. They said human channeled mana through breathing technique as their basic function to connect their manasphere inside toward the ever empowering law of System outside. Thus, for this situation, Shira simply pinched Merly’s neck and covered her mouth as to not let her breathing properly.

“Sffhwine! Shhffwiiine!”

Indeed that worked. Mama Ross felt the mana being supplied to her halted, and abruptly her sharp gaze moved to the restrained Merly.

“Release Merly immediately!”

Shira staggered, the fiery aura Mama Ross radiated intimidate him. But with Yashura Family’s safety behind him, he forced himself to hold his ground.

“You’re going to destroy Yashura Family, Esteemed Lady Nalaq, please quell your anger!” Shira begged.

“Impudent! Who told you to talk back to me! Release her!”

Shira’s sucked a deep breath. He just did what he did because he thought that Mama Ross lost her mind in a momentary lapse of reason, all due to Good-Natured Spirit’s assault. Yet the more he saw, the clearer it was to him that he was wrong. The lady Nalaq had her mind in order, and the anger and the killing intent directed toward the boy were real.

For a split second Shira glanced at Good-Natured Spirit, the one who started it all, but it was useless. The bastard was mesmerized in the awe of Mama Ross’s curves, wasn’t clear whether he realized--or even cared--about the impending doom that would soon befall them.

“Good-Natured Bastard!” the boy yelled.

Good-Natured Spirit glanced at him for a second, shrugging, then swept back his eyes to enjoy the scenery. The enraged Mama Ross had her ethereal clothes became more transparent, so Good-Natured Spirit couldn’t be bothered.

Seeing that talking to both the Nalaqs was useless, Shira then whispered beside Merly’s ear. “Please do me a favor. Lady Nalaq can burn the bastard all she wants, just not here in Yashura Family.”

There was no response coming from Merly. All Shira could hear was her heavy breathing, breathing through her mouth, the breath that escaping from between his fingers.

“Please, talk to Lady Nalaq,” Shira said again, begging.

Merly was stiff like a statue. Shira had no choice but to release her, since he had no more reliable options. Yet although he didn’t have too much hope relying on the girl, never did he expected that Merly would turn on him, with her eyes drown in fury, pointing her finger with surefire judgement.

“Swine! How dare you touching me! Who do you think you are?!” Merly’s scream squealing sharply. Turning to Mama Ross, she complained, “Mama Ross, please give me a justice!”

“Good!” the flaming Mama Ross curtly exclaimed, “no wonder such a hateful Nalaq found himself a home here. Turns out they’re both wearing the same disgusting wolf skin, good!”

Shira’s eyes turned cold. It didn’t need a brain for him to realize the lady Nalaq intended to burn the defenseless him before she dealt with Good-Natured Spirit.

Merly began to recharge mana again for Mama Ross. Shira felt they didn’t even hesitate this time.

Yet, in spite of him standing in a dangerous situation, Shira didn’t bulge. He just stared at them coldly, didn’t even try to defend himself.

“You’re a guest of Yashura Family, are you sure you want to harm your host?” the boy warned icily.

Mama Ross scoffed. She began to conjure a fireball, not too big, but enough to burn the cocky boy to half-death state.

Good-Natured Spirit, who was interrupted, “Ah, big boobs lady, I know that little shit is kinda annoying, but I wouldn’t throw that dangerous fireball at him if I were you.”

“Shut up! You’re the next one who’s gonna die, Gyl!”

Good-Natured Spirit laughed. Sure enough, this lady Nalaq was a bimbo. He, the Nalaq who had been here for around a year, would plan it through step by step before even he pluck a strand of the boy’s hair. “Harming someone behind Yashura Family’s wall is hefta complicated matter than you’d think,” he said.

Though he wasn’t going to admit it, Good-Natured Spirit look forward to seeing the cocky boy who always rob his wallet after games of chess going to piss himself. It wasn’t happening, to his disappointment, the boy proved to have nerves of steel in the face of growing deadly fireball--that, or was in dire need of getting his brain diagnosed. 

Was the little moron knew the fireball from a high-leveled Nalaq could do more than melt his face?

Good-Natured Spirit sighed. Thinking about it again, this Yashura young master brat would really dying wasn’t going to happen. He curious who was going to step forward to diffuse the situation, anyway. 

The only thing he regretted that the bimbo’s melons this time actually the real deal. Unfortunately, the first thing she did after coming to this village was to poke on the hornet nest. Though he, as the good-natured gentleman he was, wanted to save a bimbo in the imminent distress--definitely not when he wasn’t sure whether the bimbo would throw fireball at his face again after he saved her like a handsome, suave knight as he actually was. 

_SWUOOOOSSSHH!!_

Before even Mama Ross could throw her fireball, four pouncing metal snakes sprang from her blind spots, coiling around her transparent body. 

The one who diffuse the situation as Good-Natured Spirit predicted really did stepping forward.

Four masked silhouette leaped out of their hiding place, pushing the stunned Mama Ross’s face onto the ground. All happened too fast. Merly, in midst of freaking out, only to return at reality at the scene of Mama Ross being reprimanded in chains by four masked women in black--and very tight--clad. Only two seconds passed, Merly herself got pushed down by from behind.

Shira, with his eyes alert, glanced back to prepare being reprimanded like Mama Ross and Merly. Yet the masked women didn’t bother with him. The boy wasn’t sure whether this mysterious group lacked personals or simply didn’t see him as a threat. He wasn’t expecting them at all.

On the contrary, the only one who expected these mysterious women in tight suits’ arrival was Good-Natured Spirit; he was happy to see those voluptuous curves again. Some of them had even bigger melons than Mama Ross.

This made Shira tightening his brows. Weren’t these women from the hidden Big-Boobs Sect Good-Natured Spirit mentioned once?

As they said, seeing is believing. Seeing that Good-Natured Spirit was smug and happy there was no reason for Shira to not believing him now.

“Release me! We did our stand against their sexual assault! Release Mama Ross!” Merly screamed. Even then, the masked women didn’t budge. They kept pinning the them down the ground.

Only after Shira watched the girl futilely cried her injustice he did notice the masked women didn’t come here to antagonize Yashura Family. He would be at the disadvantages otherwise, since the other party didn’t seem to be uninformed Badril Village dwellers who were ignorant of the southerner rules. Shira wasn’t afraid of Mama Ross and the faraway Yurin Family since they were outsiders; however, if the women were sent by someone who rooted in Badril Village, it’d be quite a different story.

_Splaash!_

The sound of splashing water came as surprising as thunderous strike. Just when the esteemed Nalaq Mama Ross being pushed down pitifully and Merly had to spit dirts than accidentally entered her mouth as her cheek forced kissing the ground, the old butler, Yulong, unconcernedly ran toward the fire with a bucket of water.

“Yulong!” Shira ran toward the butler, and urgently whispered, “go tell my uncle, anonymous members of a hidden sect came into our walls!”

Yulong, gazing at his young master blankly, asked, “What hidden sect, young master? I don’t know what you are talking about.”

“Don’t you see how they pin down Madame Nalaq?” Shira hissed.

Yulong followed the direction Shira signaled with his eyes. The masked women awkwardly waiting for the old butler took his eyes off them. A moment later, the butler’s eyes came back to the boy again. His wrinkled face smiled with worry. “Young Master Shira, I don’t see anyone there.”

“Yulong, you’re joking,” Shira said wryly. Yulong always a solemn man and never did Shira saw him made a joke--especially not in this kind of situation. “They burned down the damned place, Yulong. All started because Madame Ross confront that guy!”

“What guy?” Yulong again followed the direction Shira signalled, but now with a pair of alertful eyes. The Nalaq with a guitar brazenly returned back the butler’s gaze, he scoffed. Yulong’s gaze turned cold.

But then Yulong said to Shira again, “I don’t see anything, Young Master.”

“Yulong…”

“Young master, I really don’t see anything,” Yulong said with an assuring smile. “Even if I did, do you think some people have that kind of nerve to do that kind of brazen thing inside of Yashura Family walls? What if…”--his eyes tracked on the masked women, the pinned Nalaq, and the screaming girl--, “what if Yashura Family relatives leave their works outside and run back here because some misunderstanding?”

Good-Natured Spirit laughed at the blatant indirect threat. The eyes of the masked women flickered, exchanged glances at each other, and quickly came to a decision; they must leave this place immediately.

The masked women disappeared like a wind blowing puffs of smoke, bringing the crying and screaming Merly and Mama Ross whose eyes seemed to be lost. All of the sudden, the burning place turned quiet.

“See, there’s nothing there,” Yulong nodded as if he was satisfied with something.

Now that the beautiful lasses already gone, Good-Natured Spirit laughed sarcastically at the old butler as he playfully played his guitar. “I didn’t see anything, I didn’t do anything.” And with that, he flew away like nothing had happened.

Not long after that, a panic stricken crowd came trotting urgently with buckets of water on their hands. Leading them was Patriarch Shuro, who upon seeing the large fire and the hole in the family’s wall with his own eyes, had almost fainted on the spot. It was fortunate Mila was there with a few of idle young wives she knew, who most of them knew had an affinity with water elemental and could provide some help in extinguishing the fire.

“Shira, what’s happened here?!” Mila asked with shrill voice.

Before Shira could decide whether to tell the truth or not, Butler Yulong came forward and begged for forgiveness. “Apologize, Young Lady Mila, this servant burned some trash here and unwittingly set ablaze the whole place. It’s all my fault.” he admit regretfully. After lifting his head from bowing in front of Mila, Yulong looked at the blinking Shira, then smiled at the two cousins. “Thankfully, those trashes already gone. So I guarantee no accidents will happen in the future.”

Since Yulong already plead guilty from the whole matter, naturally Mila let it go and focused on helping the crowd stopping the fire before it spread somewhere else. Nobody there except Shira had a second thought on Yulong’s confession.

Shira glanced at the butler, the old man who he’d known far back since he was in milking years. He still hesitating. Not to mention the rampaging Mama Ross and the Big-Boobs Sect--as Good-Natured Spirit called them--actually did exist, Shira really didn’t expect Yulong, the one who supposed more solemn and strict than an ox, could actually tell lies with such a straight face. He was shocked by the revelation.

Eventually, an hour was needed to extinguish the fire. Yashura Family then fought the disaster with grit and grievance. It was considered slow since they had a few spare water affinity Mage with them. This partly because never did anyone expected that the more serious explosion happening, but more because they had been worried the whole time about a matter that none of them could answer. 

“Patriarch Shuro Yashura,” Baront Staterwind came in with solemn atmosphere, the trace of his previous politeness wasn’t there anymore, “my disciple Merly Yurrin and Esteemed Madame Ross wandered around in Yashura Family. But still till now, we can’t find here, their aura we’re supposed able to track also vanish without a trace.”

The whole line of Patriarch Shuro’s family were nervous. Someone even gulped because the tense mood.

“We’re coming with friendly intention, Patriarch Yashura, we’re just want to find them right now. So if you know something, please do tell us. Consider this I’m indebted to your Yashura Family.”

Patriarch Shuro nodded gravely. Then he turned his head to Mila his daughter.

“Mm.” Mila Yashura nodded solemnly. Then she turned her head to Shira her cousin.

Shira wanted to turn his head but Yulong, the one who most suspicious, wasn’t here with them. So he had to answer seriously, “I don’t know. I don’t see anything.”

Baront Staterwind’s and Jerrin Yurrin’s faces fell. Eventually, Yashura Family could only offer an apology and ambiguously promised to find Merly and the lady Nalaq. Sir Baront Staterwind wasn’t happy, but there was nothing he could do since Yashura Family the one who suffered the greatest lost at the end of the day.

Sometime later, Yulong the old butler was seen oversaw the servants to clean up the mess. Though Patriarch Shuro Yashura said he’d punish Yulong over the incident, the fact he still able to command over the servants like the usual, was akin to telling the outsiders that Yashura Family wouldn’t pursue this matter in spite of the heavy loss they’d received. There were mixed opinions regarding family’s policy toward the old butler this time.

“Yulong,” Shira stepped in to approach the old butler who was managing the workers cleaning the ruin, “can I talk with you a second?”

“What is it that young master needs from this old butler?” Yulong inquired with the usual polite smile of his.

Ensuring that no one else heard what he was going to say, Shira leaned in to whisper, “Don’t hide it from me any longer, Yulong. Tell me what kind of sect hidden in Elzhier Family.”

Yulong looked at him puzzledly. “Why do you think Elzhier Family is hiding anything?”

“The only family who’s in contact with foreign sect in the last ten years is Elzhier Family,” Shira said unhesitantly. “I’ve heard the Ryntia Elzhier was sending lots of trivial letters from overseas. People thought her not sending good stuff from outside means she lost favor from the sect that recruited her, but I don’t think a young woman from a no-name village would be able to live casually in foreign land if they lose the only foothold they have.”

Yulong smiled. “And why do you think they would be hiding only from the last ten years, young master?”

Shira didn’t expect Yulong would make things harder for him. He was already missing the old Yulong who always nice to him. 

“I’m pretty sure the expert who recruited Elzhier Family’s eldest young lady came from the same pack with the women that brought Merly and the lady Nalaq away.”

“Yes. But how can you be so sure?”

Shira frowned.

“Yulong, who’s your real master really, now?” he said carefully, naturally didn’t want to admit his ridiculous guess was based on the famous rumors of the said expert had her chest a bit too big than average beauties--something that he immediately linked to the nickname Good-Natured Spirit gave to their sect.

“Apologize if this old man offends you, young master,” Yulong said with an unhurried tone. “But due to my old duty for Sir Jhuro, I’ll have to make sure you prepare before you explore the uncharted side of Badril Village. But then again,” Yulong put his arms on his back and continued, “if you want to know some trivial matters, I guess I can help as long as you tell me what your current objective is.”

“I just want to fetch them back to Sir Baront and his party,” Shira said.

Yulong seemed to gather his thought for a second, with his pair of eyes that hadn’t had showing any sign of weariness due to old age landed on the boy’s face. The Young Master of Yashura Family was fifteen years old this year. One more year until his official age of ceremony. But seeing the determined young face staring back at him, in the end, Yulong could only concede and sighed deeply.

“I see, you are indeed have matured too soon, young master. There’s nothing I could do to stop you if you’re this stubborn,” Yulong said while his head nodded lightly. Then he proceed to tell Shira some matters that unknown to common people. “Although the only family in Badril Village that has adopted matriarchy system in the past, in reality, the family where women actually have the most political power is Elzhier Family. It just they don’t show their fangs in the daylight. And they spread their influence and mingle with the common folks. So you won’t be able to contact them if you go through their main door. Go ask them for Elder Shyla, young master. She handles their external matters and works in the open, so she’s the most highest ranking out of them you can meet right now. And if anyone stops you--” Yulong plucked a pin of roaring lion he had on his butler uniform--it was the popular emblem of roaring Yashura Family, “shows them that you represent Yashura Family to fetch the guests they’ve taken.”

Shira received the pin from Yulong; there wasn’t anything different with the usual family’s emblem, from what he studied. And the matter Yulong gave him the pin meant that, for whatever reasons, he wouldn’t get involved beyond this. As the one who felt the most responsible over the incident, Shira didn’t plan to rely on too much from him again, anyway.

***

Elder Shyla was born in Badril Village, had long found a successful career as a career woman in Elzhier Family’s domestic politics. And the unusual big luggages on her chest--if following the thinking of Good-For-Nothing Spirit--would also reinforced the idea of this hidden sect was already being around in Badril Village for decades. 

Shira couldn’t help but shook at the idea of hidden power controlling those usually smug Elzhiers from the shadow. It was no wonder Elzhier Family could easily retain their connections and had the more assets and material wealth than what Yashura and Malikh owned combined.

Walking toward the Elzhier Family’s pace in the west of Badril Village, the boy couldn’t help but concerned; any elders would be fine, but not Elder Shyla. The reason for this was because she was an unmarried woman, and not just an ordinary unmarried woman--if the recent Bhela Malikh wasn’t so adored for her beauty and talent, any man in Badril Village would say Elder Shyla was their goddess. The most beautiful and elegant woman in Badril Village, no other aunties could even compare. This made Shira worried if he approached her the wrong way, might lead to some headache he wouldn’t expect like what Bhela Malikh gave him already.

“Oh, isn’t this Yashura brat?” a rather unpleasant laugh could be heard from behind.

Shira turned his head. The trio privileged young thugs, as they called them, Bony and his two friends Pilek and Polio, just returned from the river with a few of freshly caught carp in their hands. The one who was laughing was that Pilek who always wore an idiotic grin on his face.

“I heard your girl ditching you for a rich boy, Young Master Shira,” he said with his grin, approaching Shira. “Don’t be too sad. Bhela that girl might not be the best for you, but hey, there are still many fish out there. Like here, you can marry this carp for life.”

Shira declined the fish Pilek jokingly offered. Seeing there was Bony there, Shira decided not to take Pilek’s joke seriously. “No thanks, I think you need it more since no girls ever accepted your confession.”

“You--” Pilek didn’t know what to say. His romance story indeed more pitiful than everyone else his age.

“You’re going to Elzhier Family?” Bony who stayed silent then asked Shira.

“Yashura Family is quite unlucky today,” Shira replied with a nod. Then he said ambiguously, “Someone got entangled in today’s accident and direly in need for something. We’ve heard Elder Shyla has this particular something and I’m willing to trade something for that something.”

Bony frowned, “What is it that you needed?”

“I want to engage in private trade with Elder Shyla,” Shira also frowned, “you’re also someone who would inherit a major family, Young Master Bonithon, I expect you to know that I’m in a pinch to not leaking sensitive matters.”

“Exactly because you’re going to inherit a major family, it’s best for you not to meet Elder Shyla in private,” Bony said. “She’s an unmarried woman. It’s one year until your coming of age ceremony. And add that to the mess with Malikh Family recently. If people say you’re too bitter and want to run away for another, people will talk. You’re yourself should’ve realized how they talked a lot of shit about you.”

Until two years ago, Bony and his two friends had always been the first one to pick on him. Shira didn’t know why, he just reckoned they had something against him. There was a hint of impatient on Bony’s tone as he explaining matters to him.

Shira sighed inside. It seemed to him that asking help from these punks was only a pipe dream. If only Mila was here, things would get easier, since that angry tomboy might be the only one who could deal with Bony. The tales from two years ago, tales of her punching Bony’s face and made his pointy nose bled still a legend amongst the youngsters.

Bony didn’t even budge when Shira showed him the pin Yulong gave him. Not surprisingly, he didn’t get anything from Bony eventually. Shira began to think to get inside Elzhier Family through bribing some guards and maidservants was easier than this. Without anymore chit-chat he along with Pilek and Polio then strode away with a bunch of fish they caught, discussing merely how they’d cook the fish and what spice they were going to use. 

And just when Shira about to decide whether to use backdoor instead, someone poked his shoulder from behind.

“Wha--? You scared me…” Shira smiled upon finding the one who poked him only a girl of ten years old. This girl also had a carp fish on her hand, and from the clothes she wore and the fact she was barefoot, Shira reckoned she was a servant’s daughter that coming along with Bony to help them fishing on the river. “Is there something you need, girl?” he asked awkwardly seeing the clear eyes of the servant girl staring deeply at him.

“Can I see that pin?” the girl asked.

Since the roaring lion pin wasn’t that precious looking, Shira agreed immediately. It didn’t seem like the girl would run away as soon as she got the pin on her hands. Instead, she studied the pin with determined face.

“Can I get that again? There’s something I need to do, girl,” Shira said hurriedly. He didn’t have the time to humor a servant girl he didn’t even know her name.

Seeing the impatience in Shira’s eyes, the girl returned the pin back to him, plus a free coupon for a shop owned by Elzhier Family. “You should wait at my parents’ shop, Young Master Shira. There are free snacks for you to eat there.”

“No, like I said, there’s something I’ve got to do.”

The girl blinked, still her eyes staring at him. Shira got uncomfortable. He didn’t even know why this girl gave him a free snacks coupon out of the sudden.

“Young Master Shira,” the girl said flatly, “if you want to fetch Young Lady Yurin and Lady Ross, you should wait at my parents’ shop. Someone soon will bring them to you.”

Shira was flastergabbed. Before even he could ask something from the girl, she already trotting far away to follow Bony and others. It was later when Shira woke up from his daze that he realized he just talked with a member of the hidden sect.

The girl, who was only ten years old and barely developed, was undisputedly a member of the so-called Big-Boobs Sect. Shira’s face was grim realizing the whole matter was far more complicated than he thought.

***

After the masked women brought her away, Merly felt her head was heavy, felt like they made her inhale something hypnotic. Although her consciousness was a mess, somehow Merly able to retain her ability to measure time, and counting only an hour had passed since the incident in Yashura Family. Her blurry perception relapsed from time to time. She heard someone talking near her, but couldn’t make up sensible conclusion.

“…I did have my suspicious, but never would’ve thought Elzhier Family is Luna’s Elzhier that I always knew…” that was Mama Ross’s voice. She said more about Elzhier, but Merly couldn’t follow her words after that. But a moment later, Mama Ross’s grave tone nearly woke Merly up. “Who is the lunatic who dared to revive Gyl’s soul?”

Merly didn’t mistaken, Mama Ross’s tone now filled with grievance, the same grievance that she felt drove Mama Ross into trying to kill that evil, vulgar rogue Nalaq.

And the one who replied Mama Ross was a woman, whose voice was clear and beautiful, merrily said, “You shouldn’t have asked a humble member of the sect like me a question like that, Lady Ross. Fortunately, Sect Founder coincidentally leave a message for you. She said that since the Liberators chairman gave his permission for you and the other pillars to take Mister Gyl down, certainly he didn’t need for your permission to revive him as a Nalaq.”

“Ha! Why still call us backstabbing women the Seven Pillars then? It’s nothing but glorify a compromise! Reviving that bastard brings nothing but disaster!”

Elder Shyla politely disagree. “Mister Gyl has been revived for around one hundred years. And no such disaster like you were talking about has happened. You better leave everything in the past, Lady Ross, as this is what our Sect Founder wishes for you. Sect Founder knew, after all, you are the one amongst the pillar to hold the most grudge against Mister Gyl. But please, Lady Ross, remember that you have Yurin Family under your wing now. And also remember Young Lady Merly Yurin is about to enter Blue Robe Society by next year. You wouldn’t want to put this girl Merly in danger, would you?”

Mama Ross didn’t answer the woman’s question. Merly, as the contractor of Mama Ross’s soul, felt the echoes of the Nalaq’s fluctuate emotion; it was the same when Mama Ross descended into uncontrollable rage upon seeing the disgusting vulgar smirk of that rogue Nalaq. Only this time, as she inflicted by Mama Ross’s overwhelming sadness, she felt like her heart being sliced by a thousand cuts.

“Ugghhh…” a soft groan escaped Merly’s lips. She wanted to get up, but even her eyelids felt heavy. Her head felt like shattered into pieces.

“Oh, you’re awake?” the woman’s voice directed at her. When Merly able to open her eyes wide, slowly the face of a beautiful vixen entered her sight. Her smile wasn’t too excessive, yet, since Mama Ross didn’t like her, naturally Merly thus found this woman quite dislikable.

It was quite difficult for Merly to see what was going on. She held through, eventually, and found out she was inside a humble room with walls made with logs of _cendana_ woods--a kind of wood that looked ordinary outward but would give a rare comforting scene for the occupants, the type that looked shabby but actually was a high-class materials. Mama Ross was sitting beside her. Two other figures in the room were the vixen who later introduced herself as Elder Shyla of Elzhier Family, along with a maidservant who was grinding herbal roots for the soup that been shimmering in the middle of the room.

Elder Shyla used a pair of chopsticks to pick braised meat cuts that was sliced in uniformed rectangle, putting them into a bowl garnished with exquisitely sliced vegetables. The silent maidservant then carefully poured the shimmering broth, creating a clear harmonic sound as the warm water splashing onto the antique-looking ceramic bowl.

Smiling to Merly, Elder Shyla said, “You must feel a bit heavy after inhaling our sect’s calming herbs. Please, Young Lady Yurin, consider this as a gesture of apology from us.”

Initially, Merly wanted to refuse the other party’s offer. Calling a numbing poison a calming herb was an outrageous understatement. Yet Mama Ross told her to accept it. “Savor the soup, my dear. You’ll never got to eat this kind of meat again.”

“Sure the meat is rare,” Elder Shyla laughed cheerfully, “even the core disciples of our sect can eat at most three serving each year. We are willing to part with it because we value Lady Ross’s past relationship with our Sect Founder.”

Merly didn’t know what kind of soup she ate that day. But she’d never forget the look on Mama Ross’s face, who seemed wry with awkwardness, almost telling her that as long as they got this soup as the compensation, then any grievance wouldn’t be too much to bear.

“Elder Shyla,” a young flat voice of ten years old girl greeted after the door being knocked thrice, “Young Master of Yashura Family came to fetch the guests.”

“Is it time? Is the Nalaq still around?”

“Yes, he’s hanging around on the street like the usual,” the young girl replied.

“Then this isn’t the time yet,” Elder Shyla said.

Merly just drank the broth till the last drop. Mama Ross told her to savor her bowl of soup clean. When Elder Shyla asked her that question, Merly put down the ceramic bowl and bowing her head in gratitude. “Thank you for the treat.”

“Drink this tea also, Young Lady Yurin, before you return to your people,” Elder Shyla offered a glass of tea, which Mama Ross also told Merly to drink.

Meanwhile, one particular shop that Elzhier Family owned just lit their torches as the day was about to end. Shira sat alone, peeling a boiled egg he got for free, while his mind doubted the lack of customers since he got here was happening without any hidden interference. Yet everything looked normal. Even the hospitable pair husband and wife that running the shop seemed like they were not people from unordinary origin.

“I saw your daughter today,” Shira said as he sprinkled salt onto his boiled egg. “Her face looks like she’ll be a great talent in the future. Any thoughts on sending her to school to study? Or sending to a certain sect?”

There was no one beside him and the pair of parents, so the husband responded his words with a laugh. “Young Master Shira surely jest. Looks like our dearest daughter got praised because a free voucher. In that case, please young master, tell us how you feel after eating this portion of free braised chicken on top of white rice!”

“Our daughter was lucky to be able to impress the aloof Young Master Yashura. Free voucher indeed is effective. We’re currently in promotion period, young master, please spread the word if you’re satisfied with our plates!” the wife said with a laugh as big as the husband’s. “Here, please drink this free avocado juice to accompany the free meal.”

Shira smiled dryly. The couple indeed knew how the world worked. He believed that these couple found out he was probing into the sect’s matter, and thus the bribe. They wanted to make Shira shut up with his curious questions.

As someone who was already experienced in taking dirty money from a certain rogue Nalaq, Shira surely wouldn’t shy away from free benefits. He took the plate and grabbed the spoon. Forcing a bunch of hidden experts to come out was useless anyway. Quietly ate his free meals, Shira believed the other party would come since they already sacrificing braised chicken and avocado juice to make him stay obediently.

He was right. Halfway from cleaning his rice, the door inside the shop was opened. A maidservant was showing Merly Yurin the way out. Shira quickly drank his juice, and asked the shopkeepers to wrap his unfinished meal. Since the wood plate already matted with banana leaves, wrapping unfinished meals should be easy. For people as great and magnomous as them, for sure they wouldn’t dislike a clueless boy for shamelessly asking to bring home a free meal, or so Shira thought.

“Haha, you surely jest, Young Master. As long as you come back again with your friends, you can take home as many as you want. Here, go bring this home.”

Shira asked to bring home his unfinished meal, but got a basketful of fresh banana leaves-wrapped braised chicken instead.

Somehow, Shira couldn’t help but took a liking toward these people with ulterior motives. Whether it was Good-Natured Spirit or this hidden sect members, they gave him free stuff. Shira took a note to visit this shop after each time he won on a game of chess against Good-Natured Spirit. Surely they’d welcome him with open arms, just the way Good-Natured Spirit used to act, right?

Shira escorted Merly Yurin back to the inn she stayed. When Sir Barront Staterwind and Jerrin Yurin saw them, they were happy to see Merly unscathed. Shira used this opportunity to clear the misunderstanding between them. Surprisingly, Merly cooperated well. Maybe she finally saw the light after being forced to kiss dirt by those masked women. Or maybe the hidden sect finally put some sense in the high and mighty esteemed lady Nalaq about how to act in southern Mossacks’ homeland. Whatever the reason, in the end, the relationship problem Yashura Family had with their guests was resolved by Shira. He himself wasn’t expecting the problem would be this easy to solve.

It was already sunset when Shira walked back home. His mind wander as he thought of the diner would be tasteless. The shock this day was too much for Yashura Family. Even the coconut lover uncle wouldn’t have so much energy to cook after this devastating incident. It was a good thing he brought a bamboo basket full of banana leaves wrapped braised chicken with him.

Accidentally, a bunch of kids playing tags brushing pass him, almost made him drop his banana leaves wrapped braised chicken. He thought of scolding these senseless kids. But the sight of a young girl laughing made him had a second thought. She made him remembered the Elzhier Family’s servant girl, the one who gave him the free voucher, a girl he believed affiliated with the hidden sect. And then he remembered one thing.

“This pin isn’t even special,” he murmured, looking at the roaring lion pin Yulong gave him. But if it wasn’t special, why a girl of ten years old could decide whether to pass him to one of the hidden sect’s covered nests, based on this pin alone?

He felt it wasn’t strictly Yashura Family that the hidden sect giving face. His uncle Patriarch Shuro was honest and clumsy, unlike the profesional Yulong, so at least the honest faces of Yashura Family he knew wouldn’t hiding anything like hidden sect or some other worrisome secret. He believed in Yashura Family’s innocence.

And that was the time he realized the pin actually was a bit different than a normal one. There was a dent on its surface. The more he looked at it, the more he convinced that the dent wasn’t there accidentally. It was made to cover one of the lion’s eyes.

“One-Eyed Lion.” A long forgotten phrase escaped his lips. One-Eyed Lion was the name of a delinquent group that his father made during his youth, that eventually won battles against bands of bandits outside and successfully securing path for merchants to safely trade with Badril Village, finally made a name for himself. When far away villages heard of Badril Village, they’d immediately remembered Jhuro Yashura and his gang the One-Eyed Lion.

Shira didn’t know much about his father. He was almost never staying at home. And Patriarch Shuro, as gullible as he always was, never asked what his brother did outside the village. A headache came to him when he realized a bunch of mess he’d had to straighten out by the time he inherit the patriarch mantle because of this matter.

“Yo kid, I saw you visit one of Big Boobs Sect’s place,” a haughty voice was heard. Shira groaned, quickly hid the pin he got, seeing the main nuisance finally showed himself again, with a cigarette between his fingers, carefreely floating with a punchable smirk on his face.

“I thought you die.” Shira snorted. 

“What? The fuck did I do?” Good-Natured Spirit groaned as if he was wronged. The boy’s indignant eyes seemed to blame him upon the whole mess. “I didn’t do anything, alright. I did play my guitar, trying to flirt with her, but suddenly she wanted to melt my face with fireballs. What a salty bimbo, tsk.”

“I saw you disrespected that lady Nalaq.”

“Ey, I just touch her butts a little bit. And that was after she went nuts with her fireballs.”

“I have the feeling you met her before and did her a great injustice. She was trying to kill you, like, really hard. Maybe she’s someone from the time when you were alive?”

“Don’t know. Told you I don’t remember things from back when I’m alive.”

“Then do you have any idea why she hates you so much?” Shira asked. “Aside, you know, your assault earlier.”

Good-Natured Spirit’s face turned solemn as he replied, “In this world, I fear no man, kid. But jealous exes? I fear them.”

“It’s unbelievable to see my Yashura Family took the hit while you still shamelessly living and kicking,” Shira said icily, clearly didn’t believe what Good-Natured Spirit said. “No, I forgot, you already dead. I don’t understand why you always make trouble and acted as if you still can use that thing of yours.”

Good-Natured Spirit only scoffed at the boy’s remark. Seeing that the boy hugging a bamboo basket loaded with bunch of banana leaves wrapped rice meal with him, Good-Natured Spirit picked one and asked, “Is this your haul from Big Boobs Sect’s hiding place?”

But at the same time the invisible to common eyes Good-Natured Spirit picked one of the braised chicken rice, a pedestrian happened to pass by, gasping at the sight of floating banana wrapped rice in the empty air.

“Wh--what?!” the pedestrian gasped as his finger pointed at the supernatural thing happening before him. He saw Shira talked alone from afar, but he dismissed it knowing the rumors about Young Master Yashura was crazy from being spotted talking alone to empty air. Yet this time, the pedestrian thought he was the one that was crazy for seeing flying braised chicken rice.

“Umm…” 

Shira wanted to explain things to the shocked pedestrian, but he took a step back as soon as Shira came forward.

But then Good-Natured Spirit just carried on to open the braised chicken wrapping to see the content of the food.

“No! Stay away from me!” the pedestrian cried in horror as he saw with his own eyes a flying braised chicken rice opening itself. Not wanting to spending a split second, he immediately ran away for his dear life.

Shira was breathless seeing the scene unfolded. It was stupid if he didn’t think this wouldn’t begin another troublesome rumor about him. He looked aside, glaring at Good-Natured Spirit who was taking a whiff on the braised chicken he opened.

“What?” Good-Natured Spirit raised his head. “The fuck did I do?”

Annoyed, Shira forcefully grabbed the opened braised chicken rice from Good-Natured Spirit’s hands, put it back to the bamboo basket. He continued walking and pretended not to see the Nalaq.
