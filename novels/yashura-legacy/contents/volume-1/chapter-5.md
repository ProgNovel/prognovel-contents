<authors-note id="Radhy">

I don’t recommend reading from here onwards because the chapter below is still from the previous draft, which is different from the previous 4 chapters. Further edits will be made that most likely makes this chapter quite different than the current one.

</authors-note>

In a certain hall in Malikh Family’s left wing complex, four people sat idly on the bamboo mats covered floor. They were being served local-specialty ginger drinks mixed with brown sugar with herbs to drink. There were also some roasted peanuts to chew. Despite they dressed humbly when attending the Ngajen Ceremony, three of them were elders with statuses, while one of them, the sword bearing Kaya man, wasn’t anyone to ignore either. 

Having knowing this, they still waiting for their host, Bhela Malikh, to wrap up the Ngajen Ceremony.

“Still,” Madame Sylvia said after a sip of ginger drink, “I wouldn’t have expected the girl’s talent to be that rare when she approached my sect with the invitation. The top brass only interested of her being the top grade during the seminar thus sent me to check her out. How about you, Mister Harrington?”

“I wasn’t expecting it either. I only interested when the report said she showed a potential of being two elemental-affinities Archer. Three already great, but with four elementals, chances she’ll get her name down in history books.”

“That is what happen if she able to live long enough to develop her full potential,” the quiet man with sharp aura remarked. His face was thin, rough, and since he never liked to smile, he always looked like he meant business. The man was role model of eastern Kaya race ancient warriors--stand and sit in straight posture, humorless, and most importantly, always bringing the sharp, thin sword of katana on his hips. 

Madame Sylvia was interested on his remark. So she asked, “Oh, why you think of that, Sir Kurusiya?” 

The eastern man replied, “Because she tangled herself with Blackwood Family,” he paused. “If this Blackwood the same one from this Blackwood guy I know, then it’s definitely a bad news for her.”

Mister Harrington from Elemental Stone School disagreed.

“Since when our factions become soft?” he questioned. “We’re not that pitiful to handle some second-rate noble family. Honestly, I think that young man from that Blackwood Family such a pest. If Young Lady Bhela asks for my favor, I’ll handle him cleanly and thoroughly--right here, right now.”

“I’m not talking about Blackwood Family, I’m talking about the creepy guy with Blackwood as his last name,” Sir Kurusiya said as he put down his ginger drink. He wasn’t happy, so Madame Sylvia signaled Mister Harrington that it best not to continue arguing with the scary eastern Kaya man.

The hall suddenly turned quiet. Then, the fourth man was happily enjoyed his drink, out of the blue he blurted for his opinion that no one asked for. “That boy from Yashura Family is sure interesting…”

Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia smiled wryly. Nobody said anything about Yashura Family up until now. The fourth man, Baront Staterwind, came from a very peculiar faction. Which actually had nothing to do with Bhela’s type of talent. Even when he had already came to Badril Village, none would think he accepted Bhela Malikh’s invitation just to scout her talent.

The hall’s door was knocked. Bhela entered. She politely greeted the four respected guests before she sat down.

“I’m sorry for the wait, dear elders. Malikh Family hasn’t prepared the best dishes for you during the ceremony, so I asked the best chef we have to cook special meals for you,” Bhela said, then she glanced at the door. “Please enter, aunty!”

The moment she called, a middle-aged woman who helped Bhela in the kitchen before came with a line of maidservants, bringing freshly cooked dinner meals with them. It was better than what the Malikhs served for the guests before, even compared to the meals served for the family’s important guests cooked by Bhela as the chief chef.

“I rather you serve me some alcohol,” the eastern Sir Kurusiya said to her.

Bhela nodded at his request and asked the aunty to fetch the best alcohol she could find. Of course, the best person to get help was the elder who provided Bhela with the hall to host her guests. Bhela hoped the said elder already knew the importance of this meeting thus not being stingy with his alcohol collection.

“Can we start now, young lady? I don’t have a good alcohol tolerance so I rather get this completed before us adults get to drink,” Madame Sylvia said.

“We have delicious food here served, Madame Sylvia. To be honest, all the wait before is for the aunties preparing dinner for dear elders,” Bhela said.

But not of the adults believed her words easily.

“Hoho, you seem so nervous, young lady. You might not look like it, but you seem about to cry,” Sir Baront Staterwind said.

“Just state what you want from us, don’t waste anymore time,” Sir Kurusiya urged.

Bhela lowered her head. With her lips tremblingly parted, she said, “As you might know, my father fell ill when I was overseas attending the seminar. My mother has contacted many doctors and alchemists to make medicines for him, yet my father’s condition never improved. I request for elders’ wisdom and strength, please help my poor father, he was in misery for months…”

Bhela prostated.

“Please, help me father… he’s dying… please…” she begged.

Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia exchanged glances. The peculiar beardy man, Sir Baront, merely nodded without letting his thoughts known. Meanwhile, Sir Kurusiya, who didn’t bulge seeing the pretty girl begging in front of him, coldly said, “Well, this is really a waste of time.”

Hearing the eastern man snorted, Bhela’s heart went cold. She prepared herself bowing down for help, without stating a single offer to prove how desperate herself.

“And, young lady…” Madame Sylvia asked slowly, “what would you do if someone managed to heal your father?”

Bhela rose up. She looked straight to Madam Sylvia’s gaze, then said, “Anything,”

“Anything?”

“Anything.”

The room went quiet. Only Mister Harrington’s regretful sigh could be heard.

It was Sir Baront Staterwind who explained with a good intention, “It really seems you haven’t grasped the situation you were in, young lady. The guest who gave you the gift from before, he’s a young master of a family known as the peerless medicine makers and doctors. If they couldn’t cure your father illness, then I believe no one in this room knows who really can.”

“If I had a petty mind, young lady, I’d kill for the cosmetic you got from them. That’s how valuable their skills are,” Madam Sylvia said as she shook her head in pity.

Bhela Malikh bit her lips. She was eloquent when she invited these experts months ago. Yet tonight, she had completely became tongue-tied and defeated. The cold air suddenly felt more unbearable. Although the warm meals’ delicious aroma wafted through the hall, not a single person had any incentive to touch their food. Everyone in the hall sunken into silence.

“You want my advice, young lady?” the sharp voice of Sir Kurusiya sliced through the awkward atmosphere. He continued, “Having turned your back against Yashura Family is the dumbest decision you did. I didn’t come here because of you. I know your father, and I certainly know that swordsman from Yashura Family more. It’s a pity I couldn’t meet them today. Really, a complete waste miles and miles of journey.”

With that, Sir Kurusiya, stood up and prepared to leave. 

Bhela Malikh quickly swallowed her bitterness, also stood up and said, “Please, Elder Kurusiya, let me see you the way out.”

“No, don’t,” Sir Kurusiya flatly rejected her offer. “Sit down. These three fogies still haven’t decided what they want to do with you. Better think carefully about what you’re going to say to them next.”

The eastern man saw himself out. Following his suggestion, Bhela Malikh sat down again and faced the three experts, with her mind suddenly became as blank as a barren field in the corner of abandoned land. She didn’t know what she ought to say to them, seeing the looks of pity they directed at her. Then, just when she managed to regain her bravery to say something, the door slammed open--

“I come as the representative of Blackwood Family!” Young Master Frane Blackwood boldly yelled.

He swagered himself in along with Elder Jhamil’s son and the adjutant of Blackwood Family under his wings. The arrogant  behaviour of this young noble completely disregard the experts in the room. Madame Sylvia had enough. She dissed him, “What are you doing here uninvited?”

Instead of the adjutant who usually spoke for his young master, it was the young elder of Malikh Family, Elder Jhamil’s son who replying. “This madam has eyes but doesn’t know what good for her. Of course Young Master Blackwood is invited! He’s the special guest of Malikh Family after all!”

“What’s your name, boy?” the middle-aged woman hissed.

“I’m Elder Jhamil’s eldest son! What’s up with you, you don’t have the right to know my name!”

“Is that it? Very well. It seems just because I respect the southerner custom by dressing commonly you ignorant people already forgot what's best for you. Very well!”

_Zziiing!_

With a flashing draw of metallic sword, Madame Sylvia stood up to give this ignorant young elder a lesson. But her companion Mister Harrington quickly pulled her back before things really blown up.

“You brought a weapon with you!” the Elder Jhamil’s son screamed with his finger pointing at Madame Sylvia who already trembling holding back her fury. “Do you not know what’s gonna happen to guests who bring weapons inside their host’s home?”

Young Master Blackwood rolled his eyes and told his adjutant, “Send this toad out of here, he’s too noisy!”

“Right away,” the adjutant said. Then with his bony hands, he pulled the screaming Elder Jhamil’s son forcefully.

“Is the discussion still ongoing?” Frane Blackwood asked the sitting guests as he tightened the blue necktie he wore. He said to Bhela, “Blackwood Family offers a lifetime terms of benefit for you, young lady. Not only medicines, if it boost potion you ask, or equipments, magic items, weapons--you name it, we have all things you’d dare to imagine!”

“Hoho,” his uninvited offer gave Sir Baront Staterwind a chuckle. The three guests Bhela invited hailed from their own factions, so even if they wanted to rope Bhela in, they would consult with their higher ups about the specific terms they’d give to her as benefits. However, Blackwood Family was, in fact, only a noble family, not an organizational faction, with the only way in was through marriage--so of course the young noble would be able to offer a “lifetime benefits” to her so brazenly.

“Thank you for holding back your anger, Madame Sylvia,” Bhela completely bowed her head to the angry guest while she completely disregarded Young Master Blackwood’s offers.

Madame Sylvia nodded. She then looked at Young Master Blackwood and snorted. “Young lady, think carefully about what we said before. Some incapable people only able to spout honey trap to get what they want. Don’t be foolish because your father’s situation.”

“Thank you for the advice…”

Young Master Blackwood wanted to argue with this lady. But he also held himself back as he didn’t know the other party’s identity. Therefore, all he could do was haughtily smiling elegantly as a proper noble as he was.

“Has the discussion already started?” Frane Blackwood asked again. Pity him, not even one interested in answering. Because of that his face became red as he fumed with anger.

“Ah,” Sir Baront Staterwind looked outside the window and slapped his thigh, “look how late it is! I planned to sleep early because I have something I need to do tomorrow early in the morning!”

Bhela Malikh quickly offered to see him till the gate.

“Hoho, how about you two?” Sir Baront asked the last two foreign experts, the pair of middle-aged man and woman, “overstaying your visit is considering a burden to these good Mossack folks, don’t you think so?”

“I’m but an ignorant western lady, I know little about the way of the southern people, so please don’t mind us being shameless,” Madame Sylvia said. She then looked at Bhela, “Young Lady Bhela, Mister Harrington and I apparently haven’t booked our place in the village’s inns. We don’t know our talks would turned out dragged this late. For this I have to beg you to let us stay in Malikh Family for a few good days.”

“Hoho…” Sir Baront Staterwind chuckled as he looked at the poker face pair of experts. Wasn’t the four of them--including Sir Kurusiya, checked in the same inn this afternoon? It was clear Madame Sylvia and Mister Harrington had their own intentions, thus Sir Baront Staterwind shrugged the idea of exposing their little white lies.

And with that, Bhela Malikh led the three expert guests she invited out of the room. Young Master Blackwood, who was ignored so hard she almost exploded, yelling, “Young Lady Bhela!”

Bhela turned around. “Yes, Young Master Blackwood?”

“How about me?”

Bhela Malikh blinked. Then she picked a bowl of roasted peanuts and approached him, saying softly, “Please sit down and enjoy this snack. I need to attend to my guests.”

Hearing her soft, yet slightly cold voice, Young Lady Blackwood the understood something that made him excited, so excited he obediently sat down and nimbled on the roasted peanuts the beautiful Young Lady Bhela gave him.

Then after Bhela brought the guests out, the Blackwood Family adjutant who was waiting outside came in inside the hall.

“What are you doing?!” Young Master Blackwood hissed.

The adjutant gawked. “Young master, I’m here to serve you…”

“Serve me?” the young master cringed. What a joke! Soon he’d have a time being alone with Young Lady Bhela, and this old man wanted to be here right when he had the chance of his lifetime? What if there--during the discussion--was an accident where he had to be responsible as a man? Would he be happy if the adjutant was here when that happened?

Absolutely not!

“Get out! Don’t dawdle around here tonight! I need to discuss an important manner with Young Lady Bhela secretly!”

“Y-young master--”

“What are you waiting for! Go back to the inn and don’t bother me till the next morning!”

The adjutant naturally understood what was inside the young master’s mind. He didn’t dare to linger around. With careful steps, he closed the door and went back to the inn Blackwood Family checked in.

In the meantime, Young Master Blackwood was so excited he couldn’t sit calmly alone in the hall. The thought of having private discussion with a girl as pretty as Bhela Malikh made him thinking a lot of things. Slowly, he getting horny.

“What is taking her so long?” he mumbled to himself after waiting a fruitless thirty minutes. “Is it maybe she needs to… prepare, herself?”

If it was going to be her first time, of course she needed time to prepare herself, Young Master Blackwood thought. This young noble had “befriend” and participating in “private discussions” with many experienced women. But virgin girls, he never tasted any.

Because of that, he willing to wait however much longer for the young lady to prepare herself. And thus, after waiting for another thirty minutes, nothing happened. Nothing happened for the next hour as well. Then, after waiting for nearly three hours alone, the door finally opened…

“Young Lady Bhela, you finally ready!” Young Master Blackwood snapped out of his sleepy face and excitedly came to greet the visitor. Much to his disappointment, the visitor turned out to be the faithful adjutant.

“Why is that you?!” Young Master Blackwood roared.

“Y-young master… let’s get back to the inn,” the adjutant nervously asked.

“Where’s Young Lady Bhela?”

“She is in her room…”

“Then you send someone there to ask her when she’s going to meet me,” the young noble ordered.

“I’m afraid I can’t… young master…”

“I’ve been waiting for hours, why?”

The adjutant gulped before he replied.

“Because the young lady has already gone sleeping since three hours ago!”

So much for his dreamy private discussion! Young Master Blackwood was so angry for being misled that he slapped the adjutant’s face all the way back to his inn.

***

A single torch on a stick stubbornly lit the corner of the village in spite of the strong wind. A howling wolf in the distance reinforced the lone, cold sense of the midnight Badril Village. The only shop that still open at this hours could be counted with one hand, and this liquor shop was one of them. No customer visited it except a foreign eastern Kaya man.

A series of step could be heard. The sleepy shopkeeper snapped back when he heard a new customer approaching.

“Give me a glass of _tuak_, shopkeeper,” the new customer ordered with a booming voice. One could see his beardy feature when his face exposed to the shop’s lantern light. “Mind if I join you, Sir Kurusiya?”

The eastern man didn’t reply. He drank his alcohol instead.

Sir Baront Staterwind laughed by his cold treatment. The beardy guy was an easygoing person, so he casually grabbed a bowl of steamed peanuts and started to nibble on those snacks.

“You’re not visiting Bhela’s father? You said you know him, you know, saying hi to a sick old buddy?”

“I don’t say hi to a dying man,” Sir Kurusiya said.

The answer made the air awkward. So Sir Baront quickly came with another topic.

“It seems those two lovers adamant to protect the girl,” he said, referring to the other two experts who once were couple before Mister Harrington lost Madame Sylvia to another guy. “Or I think they just want some privacy to have some little reunion… who knows?”

Sir Kurusiya never bothered with petty gossip, he callously replied, “They don’t know Malikh Family. They can’t protect her forever.”

“Exactly,” Sir Baront Staterwind agreed. After that both men continued drinking without saying anything.

“Hey shopkeeper,” Sir Baront called, “don’t you have anything with less alcohol? I have a business I’d like to deal with tomorrow, so I want to avoid shitty hangover.”

“I have some sweet _tuak_,” the shopkeeper poured a new bottle into Sir Baront’s empty glass, “this one usually for them boys who haven’t gone coming of age ceremony. No alcohol, costs as little as four copper kobe coins.”

“Four coppers, ah! Why’s that the souther I go the cheaper the drink?” he sipped it, “mm! Pretty good, my good man!”

He tipped the shopkeeper with a silver coin. The shopkeeper was dumbfounded but quickly recovered and hid the coin safely.

Sir Kurusiya said to Sir Baront, “You want to go to Yashura Family tomorrow?”

“How did you know?”

“Even though I can’t see him, I know the one who repelled Bhela’s arrow was a Nalaq,” Sir Kurusiya said.

“Hoho, since I managed to rope in the young lady of Yurin Family, I’ve got promoted to an instructor,” Sir Baront smiled widely. “Doing the legwork isn’t my job anymore… but checking him and the boy won’t hurt, so I’m going. Hmm, I wonder if the Nalaq has already form his contract?”

“Huuh…” the shopkeeper, who had been hearing their chatting, couldn’t help but asked, “you good sir, what’s this talking about a Nalaq having to do with Yashura Family?”

“Oh, you’re a Yashura?” Sir Baront asked.

“I’m Elzhier, from the outer family,” the shopkeeper said. “I’ve been in this village for forty years, but never I’ve heard any Nalaq passing by.”

“Hoho, that’s why I’m going. Usually a rogue Nalaq isn’t someone tied with a faction, so they aren’t that big of deal--which also make them easier to rope in!”

“Ooohh! Are you a Nalaq expert, mister? From overseas? Our family’s eldest young lady actually was scouted by a passing expert from overseas too, an expert from purple something sect!”

“Hoho, you mean Purple Garden Sect?” Sir Baront Staterwind and asked as he played along.

But Sir Kurusiya was sceptic. “Purple Garden Sect is too far. And someone from that kind of superpower faction won’t be too idle to accidentally passing by on this kind of rural village.”

Sir Baront nodded at Sir Kurusiya’s logic. Even if it was that particular sect that accepted the said young lady, both experts wouldn’t be too sure about whether she could be the sect’s legitimate disciple. Their doubts made the shopkeeper embarrassed. Since ten years ago, the tales of the eldest young lady of Elzhier Family being accepted by a foreign expert was a legend amongst Badril Village locals. Except her and the recent Malikh Family’s young lady, no one in the village was lucky got scouted to study oversea, so it became a fact that Elzhier Family was very proud of--and was one of the reasons why the Elzhier could win the village head’s seat from Yashura Family after their decades of leading Badril Village. But the problem was, in the letters their young lady sent home, she always talked about shops, fashions, and some other trivial stuffs that usually young women her age excited about. That made even her father, the current Elzhier Family’s patriarch and the Village Head, felt it was became difficult to still boasting the young lady’s status after ten years of her spending overseas.

“But still, experts, you might not know this, but our eldest young lady was Young Lady of Malikh Family’s closest childhood friend! When Young Lady Bhela Malikh only a little girl our young lady gave her a lot of pointers and knowledge, so much that I assure that if it wasn’t for her being there for Young Lady Bhela, the Malikh Family wouldn’t get their talented Unique Class for at least the next one hundred years!”

“Right…” Sir Baront became awkward instantly. To think some ignorant folks believed blessing of Unique Classes was that simple, even Sir Kurusiya scoffed at the idea.

The shopkeeper’s face became red as he realized it was wise not to delay any longer. So he quickly said, “If you have some spare time, sir experts, I’m sure our Elzhier Family willing to entertain you!”

After paying for their drinks, even the agreeable Sir Baront Staterwind felt it was very awkward for him to return to this little shop. Both decided not to get themselves involved with Elzhier Family after the shopkeeper’s little salesman talks, whilst not knowing the inn they stayed inn owned by Elzhier Family.

On the way back, Sir Baront asked Sir Kurusiya for advice.

“Yo, Kurusiya, I’m going to accept the Yashura boy as my third disciple if the Nalaq’s pretty good. But, you know, the Nalaq who contracted with youngest disciple is a master thirteen thousands years ago. She was a heavy weight figure, so I reckon I’ll let her calls the shot. What’s your opinion on this?”

“How powerful is this Nalaq you’re talking about?”

Sir Baront grinned. “You know the legend about Seven Pillars of Tiramikal Continent? She’s the Frost Mage mentioned in that history. Pretty neat, huh? She was able to revive as Nalaq and regained her consciousness five years ago. All the big shots in my Blue Robe Society can’t wait for the girl she’s contracted with to formally accepted into our faction.”

“If that’s the case then your disciple isn’t necesserily worse than Malikh’s four elemental Archer girl.”

“So you know why I can’t accept the boy if he’s too crude--I can’t afford to offend this madam Nalaq even the slightest bit.” he took out a bag of roasted peanuts he bought from the shopkeeper, and started to nibble on them. “I’m going to write a letter to my disciples, they’ve been playing around in the neighboring village. This madam Nalaq will come and check the boy herself.”

Sir Kurusiya abruptly stopped his steps.

“You want my advice?” he looked straight at Sir Baront’s eyes. “My advice is simple. You’re going to make this madam Nalaq of yours polite and you’re going to beg her to be mindful of her attitude in front of Yashura Family.”

“You’re joking? You serious?”

“I’m always serious,” Sir Kurusiya said.

***

Patriarch of Yashura Family, Shuro Yashura, was exhilarated to see Grandpa Piss and Snotty came to visit the village. One part because he treasured the friendships between their family and Grandpa Piss’s relatives, but mainly, he got to show-off his latest coconut cake recipe. 

“Ah, this is life, drinking _tuak_ when we’re watching the moon, getting drunk while we’re eating coconuts. What a life!” Patriarch Shuro mumbled.

“What a life indeed,” Grandpa Piss nodded with a low chuckle. On the sky, the full moon was shining bright really beautiful.

After he’d done his part in ngajen ceremony, Patriarch Shuro Yashura accompanied the old Alchemist and his grandson in a spacious veranda, where they ate coconut cakes and drinking _tuak _while spending time moongazing. They had the Yashura Family’s sole butler, Yulong, to hold the _tuak _bottle and refilled their cups when empty.

“Grandpa Piss, why didn’t you tell us beforehand before you visit Badril Village? We ran out of _rendang_ before even the ceremony ended, so I’m sorry if you couldn’t eat _rendang_!”

“Hoho, we already ate chicken curry in Malikh Family, you don’t have to prepare food for us,” Grandpa Piss said.

“How about breakfast? Are we still have leftover chickens, Yulong?”

“We still have some leftover grilled village chicken, I’ll talk with the kitchen to reheat two portion first thing in the morning,” Yulong said.

The Yashura Family’s patriarch was a role model of the stereotype Mossack people. He loved to cook and loved even more to feed people. It was no wonder why southern Mossacks’ visitors always felt welcomed whenever they visited the southern lands.

“I sent them to bring _rendang_ to Malikh Family, I never expected something like that to happen, hah!” Patriarch Shuro shook his head with a weak smile plastered on his face. During their talk, Grandpa Piss mentioned they met with Shira and Mila, as well mentioned the duel that happened between the two families’ young ladies and the upcoming duel between Shira and the young noble from Blackwood Family. “Whatever, if jerks wanted to fight with us, we won’t back down. Yashura Family never a coward!”

“I believe Young Master Shira knows what he has to do,” Grandpa Piss assured.

“I hope so, pity his father never around to hold the sky falling for him,” Patriarch Shuro gulped his _tuak_. “Anyway, let’s talk about something else. That Ghalim, you checked on him, Grandpa? What’s happened to him?”

Snotty a little scared when Shuro Yashura suddenly brought up that topic. Snotty glanced at Butler Yulong’s wrinkled face, Yulong smiled back at him. The big muscle man couldn’t help but shuddered inside.

“Patriarch Ghalim isn’t feeling well after eating some unhygienic food. I already prescribed some medicine for him, but I don’t know when he’d be able to get back at being patriarch since his digestive system was never good.”

“Ah, is that so? Never knew he had something like that,” Patriarch Shuro mumbled. “There’s this really bad rumor about him being poisoned, Grandpa Piss, we never had something wicked like that in Badril Village.”

“No, no no no, I can assure you, it’s not poison. I’ve been in the business more than seventy years--it’s _not_ a poison.”

Grandpa Piss helped Yashura Family a lot when the patriarch’s in-law, Jhuro’s wife, had Shira in her belly. So Patriarch Shuro had long esteemed Grandpa Piss’s medicinal skill, even though he didn’t really had any idea how skillful the friendly old man was. He believed Grandpa Piss in the end.

“We shouldn’t talk about sad things, Patriarch. Here, I bought a _tuak_ my family handmade ourself. Let’s give it a try,” Grandpa Piss said.

“Please, let me,” Butler Yulong asked the _tuak_ bottle Grandpa Piss took out and poured it evenly to Patriarch Shuro’s, Grandpa Piss’s, along with Snotty’s glasses.

The second thing Patriarch Shuro loved, after coconuts, was a strong _tuak_. He was the first one to gulp his glass clean, and he sighed about how good Grandpa Piss’s family _tuak_ craft was. However, soon after that, his eyes somehow became heavy.

“Huhh… usually, I still can drink till dawn…” Patriarch Shuro said with a yawn. “Let’s drink together… come on, Snotty, come drink with Uncle Shuro more.”

“Patriarch, I think you are tired,” Yulong said softly, rejecting to pour patriarch’s glass.

“Snotty, you go accompany Uncle Shuro inside,” Grandpa Piss said.

Snotty nodded while still holding his glass full of _tuak_. The liquor was definitely mixed with something. Considering it was his grandfather who presented it, it was amazing to see Patriarch Shuro Yashura to be able to resist the urge to sleepiness. Snotty stood up and brought the yawning Shuro Yashura away.

After both of them gone, Yulong picked up a clean glass. He poured the liquor that made Patriarch Shuro sleepy and drank it for himself. Grandpa Piss took out his second bottle and accompanied Yulong drinking _tuak_.

“Is there’s something you need to discuss with me?” Yulong asked.

“Indeed, it’s about Ghalim Malikh’s real condition…” Grandpa Piss didn’t leave any details when he told the Butler Yulong what had really happened in Malikh Family, particularly his discovery about the true nature of poison that made Patriarch Ghalim bedridden. 

When he heard that shocking fact, there was no surprise in the butler’s old face. Only sorrow and regret.

“I knew this would happened,” Yulong sighed. 

“Then there’s Blackwood Family too…” Grandpa Piss’s sigh followed. “They seems interested in taking away Young Lady Bhela as a bride… I really don’t know what to say…”

Yulong drank the _tuak_ and told Grandpa Piss his reasoning, “That boy from Blackwood Family still hasn’t accepted Sir Jhuro’s decission to retire sixteen years ago. He’s been keeping quiet because he knew even the royalty and the organization behind him couldn’t protect him from Old Sir Lharu’s and Old Madam Sari’s retrubution. Time’s change. I reckon there’s some change somewhere that make him cocky.”

“Old Sir and Old Madam too far away to give help in case something like this happens suddenly. Should I help you and Sir Jhuro keeping tabs on Blackwood Family?” Grandpa Piss asked.

While Jhuro Yashura left behind resources and men outside before he retired, he almost never interacted with the high society of nobility. For ears and eyes to reach those fancy places, it would take time and efforts for current Yulong and Shuro Yashura to do so. It was way better to ask Grandpa Piss who already familiar due to his family’s generations of Alchemist profession. However, Yulong rejected the offer without giving it a real thought.

“You don’t need to worry. Blackwood Family only taking a ride of that boy’s ambition. If he really supports his foster family right from the start, Blackwood won’t be stuck with their viscount nobility rank.”

Grandpa Piss wanted to offer any more help, but he long sensed the old butler’s distrust of him on affairs that didn’t include medicines and elixirs. So he kept his mouth shut for the time being.

Not long after that, a golden owl landed on the veranda where the two old men enjoyed their _tuak_. The own brought a small piece of paper and inked quill with it.

“Go, send this message to Sir Jhuro, as fast as possible!” Butler Yulong said to the owl after he wrote his tiny letter. Then he glanced at Grandpa Piss and said, “this is an owl I keep around in case there’s an emergency. Sir Jhuro also brought one with him.”

Grandpa Piss nodded with a painful smile. This golden owl was long thought to be extinct, but the reality there were small amounts of them were being kept in case of emergencies. They were rare, almost becoming birds of legend. Small to medium sized kingdoms wouldn’t dare to think getting their hands on it, not to mention Grandpa Piss’s own family. But this old butler had one with him. And the prodigial man of Yashura Family casually brought this treasure bird with him to travel around the southern land.

“This is really for emergency,” Yulong said coldly, knowing full well the old Alchemist’s envy.

“I know, I know--for emergency.”

The owl then flew away bringing Yulong’s letter.

Grandpa Piss and Snotty returned back to their own village the next morning. After sending them away, Yulong found out the young master, Shira Yashura, wanted to go to the market to pick some goods for his contracted pedlers to sell. He was worried the young master’s inexperience getting him exploited. Therefore, he waited in the gate and followed the boy from behind.

In front of an inn owned by Elzhier Family, Yulong saw a familiar eastern Kaya man came out with a respectable, but humble Mossack man behind him. The Kaya man, Sir Kurusiya, noticed Yulong, immediately cupped his fist and bowed his body. That was a salute of great respect eastern Kaya men usually give to people they regard highly. Sir Baront Staterwind didn’t know what was going on, so he imitated his companion to salute Yulong even though he didn’t really know he was only a butler.

“You know them, Yulong?” Shira asked.

“The Kaya man once works in the same place as your father, young master.”

“Oh, that’s why you know him.” Yulong was his mother helper, and his father brought him along to Yashura Family when Shira still in his mother’s belly. Shira never liked to listen about his father’s past, even though it was often glorified since he was completely stopped marauding bandits from approaching Badril Village. Walking toward the market, Shira kept quiet and didn’t ask the matter any further.

Far away from Badril Village, the golden owl Yulong tasked with the emergency letter flew through walls of mist and mountains. It instinctively knew the location of its recipient, Jhuro Yashura, even though Yulong wasn’t necesserarily knew where he was. Not even a half day passed by since the bird took off from Yashura Family, it flew already more than halfway toward its destination.

Its speed was unprecendeted amongst the magical beast. No wonder commonfolks thought it was the bird of the legend. It was a shame that it failed to detect a single flash on the horizon, resulting it to succumb to a terrible fate.

_Flap flap flap!_

The owl futilely tried to avoid danger.

A single flash all it took to capture the dumbfounded owl. A pair of cold talons gripped its short neck and the next thing it knew, the owl panically flapping its wings in search of oxygen, only to be deprived of fresh air even more. The owl couldn’t see the beast, it only saw a dashingly crimson flash before it was captured by the neck. The hostile beast scretched, only after that the owl realized a damned predator eagle already got it. Annoyed by the owl’s desperate struggle, the eagle broke its neck. The handsome crimson-colored eagle then delivered the dead owl to a mysterious masked man, who then passed it to another man--a pale, thin man who only dressed himself as black as the phantom itself.

“This owl coming out from Yashura Family, Mister Blackwood. The bird brings a letter with it,” the masked man said as he presented the letter to the pale man.

“Ah, so they figured it out about the poison,” the pale man with Blackwood surname said. Beside him and the masked man, there was a third man who drained the blood of the golden owl, prepared a little feast of its dead body. The man was very peculiar; bald, with veined oversized muscles that looked like it was almost exploded, and the strange tatooes that covered its body. He was a northern barbarian, the kind that never took orders from civilized men no matter they came from the west, south, or the east. Yet, when the Blackwood guy told him top plucking the dead owl, he obidiently put aside the carcass, not daring to show any hints of disatisfaction.

“Mister, the young lady of Malikh Family turns out to be a four-elemental Unique Class, she’s a real talent with tremendous potential--your sister tries to take her to Blackwood Family and having a setback because there’s some experts happened to visit Malikh Family. Shall we send anymore resources to help her?”

“What’s her Blackwood Family have to do with me? It’s already good enough I let her to use my name to coerce people and strengthen her influence in commerce world. She’s getting annoying every time she’s using my toys. That Jhuju’s poison I sent to her only a reminder to Ghalim of our old friendship, my sister should be thankful enough if she gets some benefits from it.”

The masked man knew the pale man was irritated by his sister’s cockiness. So he excused himself and brought the crimson eagle with him, disappearing into the shadow.

“We’ve rested enough,” the pale man said as he crumbled the small letter he read. The bald barbarian’s head cocked and he await the order. “Prepare the horses,” the man continued, “I’ve got an old friend I should say hi to.”
