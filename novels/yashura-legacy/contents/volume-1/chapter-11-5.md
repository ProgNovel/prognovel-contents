Jane had just returned because the marriage she almost had was canceled due to her fiancé’s adultery. She was a maidservant back in Blackwood Family, a lower rank one, but she knew people working there well so she reckoned she could get her job back after some words spoken to higher ups. Yet upon reporting back to the head maid for her old post, she was told that there was a new girl who already filled her previous position--and no other way except for coming to work as the Blackwood Family’s young lady’s private attendant for her to continue her work.

Being an attendant of someone from the main bloodline from a mere common maidservant was a promotion--normally. But it was different when it came to the Young Lady of Blackwood Family. In Blackwood Family, for the past few years, the only things servants hoped to avoid was to serve the youngest young lady.

“Head maid! Please, anything but there!” she promptly clung on the head maid’s legs. “Don’t send me to Young Lady’s place, please do something for me to get my old post back, we’re sisters for years, head maid! Please, do me a favor--just this once!”

“Jane, don’t be foolish, the new girl is Butler Tim’s niece. They’ve been waiting for a post to be empty to slip her in the past two months. Do you think I could get it back that easily?”

“H-head maid…” Jane knew, although Butler Tim didn’t have enough influence to be a tyrant in Blackwood Family’s manor, still not someone Jane could afford to offend. Biting her bottom lip, she whispered, “Please, head maid… if I perished due to bad luck, how could my family pay their debts?”

“Get up now. Didn’t you say you have a way to pay it without working here for a dozen years more?”

“That was before,” Jane’s voice was hoarse, “I never would’ve thought that bastard only spout empty promises of taking care of my family and other bullshit. My only lucky star is that the bastard didn’t manage to make me pregnant after all this time!”

“Now you know better than rely your future on nauseating romance, so I’m going to tell you, Jane--second chances are hard to get, you need to grasp it if one appears in front of you.”

“But wouldn’t it be my last chance if I’m to serve Young Lady Blackwood? Everybody’s ended up dead after they were sent to Young Lady’s place!”

“Nonsense. Emeralda and Jenny are still alive and well these past six months working there.”

“Their death is only a matter of time!”

Head maid sighed.

“Jane oh Jane, I’m sending you not because I want to see your demise. You’re hardworking girl albeit annoying, how come I want you to die?”

Jane already felt numb being called names by this woman ten years her senior. Though in her heart she cursed the head maid with nicknames like old virgin or such, still she was desperate enough for tears falling down her cheeks. “Head maid, what do you mean by that?”

“Don’t you know Sir Arden Blackwood had inquired about the Young Lady’s place a few times recently?” the head maid asked her with an enigmatic smile.

Jane blinked. She immediately ran to the head maid as soon as she knew her old post being taken and didn’t have time to gossip with other maidservants. “Really, head maid, you know I just came back. Don’t talk in a roundabout way…”

“Sir Arden is going to hire an expert to clear plague in our Young Lady’s mansion, he’s planning to do it in a month's time,” the head maid said. “You know Sir Arden’s reputation, and you know how reliable his words are. Go serve Young Lady there--by the time Sir Arden comes with the hired expert, he’ll be grateful for loyal servants who are willing to accompany his niece in her difficult time!”

Hearing the urge behind head maid’s tone, Jane choked by her own cry from earlier. Even Madam Blackwood had to be polite to this younger brother of hers--as the man’s reputation was the sole reason Madam could be so tyrannical on ruling the Blackwood manor, to the point of always stepping her own husband all over the place. Even then, Sir Arden was too lazy to pay attention to his sister. Even since he was adopted dozens of years ago he never really bothered with Blackwood Family. Jane, a mere maidservant--could she really gain Sir Arden Blackwood’s favor?

The head maid continued, “What are you hesitating for? Even Floria that girl who even prettier than you couldn’t even get Sir Arden to glance at her--do you think any girl can have the same chance as yours right now?” she paused, learning the contour of Jane’s expression before she said again, “even if you can’t be his mistress, Jane, I assure you that at the very least, even Butler Tim won’t be able to touch your position if Sir Arden Blackwood has a good impression on you.”

Jane lowered her head. Head maid was right. A chance to get on Sir Arden Blackwood’s good side wouldn’t come as easily as this. She calculated the weight and found that, since two of her friends were sent to serve Young Lady Blackwood six month ago and still survive, a good odds that Sir Arden Blackwood would rescue her before the disease from Young Lady’s cursed bad luck would take her life for good.

There was no need for her to prepare anything. Her luggage was ready since she didn’t get to visit her old dorm. The head maid even was generous to give Jane a gift money from her own pocket, making Jane feel less regret about how things turned out in the end.

Later, to get to the young lady’s personal mansion, Jane already followed a quiet middle-aged steward with an old carriage pulled by an old mare, which had an appearance that was nothing fancy since the steward’s job all these past two years were only replenishing goods and food supplies. The mansion was originally the noble family’s vacation site, located by the idyllic site of premium private property by the greenish and calming scenery of healthy hills, thus the distance from the main mansion wasn’t trivial at all. It required almost the whole day to get there with the quiet steward’s creaky old carriage.

As they were about to arrive at the old mansion that hosted the Blackwood Family’s young lady, the quiet steward spoke, “The conditions of your colleagues aren’t good. We still haven’t yet sure of the epidemic’s epicenter, but we know there’s something wrong with nearby plants or water sources from the well in backyard of that mansion--it’s best for you to follow what the senior servant’s words from here forward.”

This steward talked as if he was sincerely giving advice, yet for those in the main manor who didn’t know the rumors about their young lady? The thought spread amongst the servants since for these past three years the young lady was the sole survivor despite many of the servants being wiped out just by staying beside her in a month’s time.

Jane curled her lips sourly. Back in the main manor the servants didn’t say much in their gossip, but everyone knew the things that left unsaid.

Arriving at the destination welcoming them were a pair of pale-faced maidservants waiting at the gate. Both were somehow familiar. A moment later, Jane was stupefied when she found out that the two white doll-like girls with black eyebags on them were actually Emeralda and Jenny she had known back since her first year being a maidservant. No longer Jane could see two noisy sisters of hers who always skipped work to gossip--only two sets of dead eyes left, seeing her but not with greeting eyes, welcoming like strangers.

“Welcome,” Emeralda greeted with a flat tone.

“Welcome,” the other girl, Jenny, repeated. No enthusiasm could be heard within their voices, as if they were greeting a stranger before them.

Jane didn’t expect this. Six months of serving in this damned mansion indeed could change gossip friends into strangers. Even when she tried to strike a conversation what replied her were business-like formal speech. In the end, the only thing Jane could do was pretend to be busy helping the quiet steward unload the carriage.

Both Jenny and Emeralda probably were chosen to welcome her because of their familiarity with each other. At least, when they noticed her was there. There were one other maidservant and one old nanny beside them, whom, when Jane tried to greet them, didn’t even bat an eye and continued to be busy sweeping a clean place instead.

“Listen, you,” the quiet steward approached Jane after he had done unloading supplies and about to return back to the city, “I will come back one week after this to replenish the kitchen. If you’ve got any questions, ask them directly to the old nanny who’s taking care of the young lady. Other maidservants are occupied. It’s best for you not to disturb them when they are busy.”

“Yes,” Jane replied, and said nothing else.

There was nothing she could say anyway, especially when she saw the usually lazy friends of hers became strangers and suspiciously diligent instead--they were so diligent that they spent the afternoon circling the yard looking for hidden dry leaves to sweep.

She quickly settled in as she wasn’t ready to interact with these strange maids. Though the mansion was old, it was Blackwood’s property, so the place was well-kept and neat, with many antiques that worth man’s years of salaries hanging around that did nothing but to gather dust--which, of course, were none existence by then since the maids zealously scrubbed those dusts all the way to blind spots.

The grim and gloom air still existed nevertheless. From the moment she stepped in Jane instinctively knew she would never spend a day here uncompensated.

“Your name is Jane?” the old nanny glanced at her through her small reading glasses, sounded a bit displeased that the maidservant came when she was doing the mansion’s account.

Regardless of the old nanny’s mood, Jane continued reporting for duty anyway. “The wind from the trip is cold and unbearable. I think I got a migraine,” but she said an excuse afterward.

The old nanny didn’t give her a second glance and focused on the account instead, said dismissively, “You can stay in your room for today, but remember to fetch a bucketwhole of fresh water from the creek in the hill.”

“A bucket?” Jane peeredly asked.

“Two buckets,” the old nanny corrected herself as she wrapped the account, put down her reading glasses, then looked at Jane and continued, “you’ve got two healthy arms, why don’t you use them more while you’re in here?”

Jane smiled sourly. Her blantant displeased expression was uncalled for, but the old nanny didn’t seem to take offense of this. The hill the old nanny mentioned could be viewed clearly even from the mansion. It was big and tall, though the old nanny called it a hill, it was almost the size of a mountain. Fetching water from there didn’t seem to be a trivial task. Jane was very unhappy inside.

“You must show your face to Young Lady today, but she’s having a nap right now, so do that before the sun sets,” the old nanny said after she was ready to send Jane away. “And don’t forget--,” she reminded, “--two buckets of water!”

After leaving the old nanny’s room, Jane was depressed. She just arrived here, and her excuse of having migraine wasn’t entirely false either. Still the old nanny chose her to do a labouring task, while there were three other maids pointlessly sweeping clean floor all over again, again and again, leaving an impression to Jane that this ought to be that thing--a senior servant showing power to her junior, Jane convinced.

And like that, just by the first day, she had formed a grudge against the old nanny.

---

Jane had met the old nanny. And two maidservants were her old mates. Only the young lady who was having a nap, and the maidservant she saw engrossed in scrubbing windows back when she headed to her room, were the ones she hadn’t yet met properly.

“Oh, hello,” Jane greeted the maidservant by the window.

“Hello,” the other girl replied.

Since they coincidentally met on the corridor, Jane thus greeted the maidservant anyway. But the other party’s reply was flat.

“Say,” the window scrubbing maidservant glanced at Jane and said, “you’re not a Mossack, are you?”

Jane blinked one moment as she digested the strange question. She was aware high-ranking servants often times mentioned some racist remarks in bad faith, but humble maidservants like her and others wouldn’t dabble themselves too deeply into the manor politics to be that conscious about their ethnicity. Frankly, Jane was surprised being asked such question.

“I’m asking you because all of us servants sent her to serve Young Lady were of Mossack descendants,” the maidservant didn’t put down her tablecloth from scrubbing the window, “higher ups often used Young Lady’s name to get rid of people they don’t like. So, is there someone hate you enough to get sending you here?”

“No, the one who suggested me to come here is head maid--I came on my own accord.”

The moment Jane said that, the other maidservant looked at her as if she looking at an idiot.

Jane wanted to smack this girl, but she refrained since she knew too little about the place. She then said dryly, “You don’t have to worry, though I’m not a comrade if yours, I used to be working together with Jenny and Emeralda. You see, the head maid even always tease me and Jenny because our names have similar--”

“You and Jenny?” the maidservant frowned.

“Oh, yes, we’re quite like sisters before…” Jane felt herself being tactful enough not to continue her words. Why was the girl so irritable? She quickly changed the topic with a forced smile, “The head maid’s the one who sent me here. She said Young Lady’s uncle will come in a month time with an expert. You’re the first one I’m telling this, Sir Arden is finally doing something for the Young Lady--in a month’s time, he’s going to save all of you!”

The maidservant looked at her at her, still frowning, still scrubbing the window.

“Why don’t you think about how to save yourself first before you start worrying about others?”

“Excuse me?”

“An idiot who’s coming to a place like this without someone forcing her to do so wouldn’t last a single month.’

Jane’s mouth was hanged open. She wanted to say something, but words stuck on her throat.

“Well, if you do have a silver tongue to please Young Lady, maybe you’re lucky and will be able to see your savior in a month’s time.” The maidservant left with a sneer to look for another window to scrub.

Glaring at the leaving maidservant, Jane huffing indignantly, “What was that?” she hissed, “what is wrong with these people.”

Now that she thought about it again, Jane realized the girl’s face was pale, as pale as Jenny and Emeralda and even the old nanny she met before. That girl was annoying, but Jane decided not to have a headache over some salty girl who happened to be in her dying breath. She was thinking she was kind enough not to show her disgust to these people, but from here on forward it did make sense to use some masker to protect some diseases from unfiltered air breathed through the mansion’s sick residents.

Jane didn’t see anyone after that. She decided to take a nap in her appointed room. The room was originally stuffy so she opened the window, because she didn’t want to breath too much unfresh air from the mansion. She woke up when the daylight beam that came through the window turned yellowish, but laid down in bed again as soon as she remembered the old nanny’s order, hoping she could pretend to be sleeping over her appointed duty. Unfortunately, the old nanny wasn’t so dull-witted to let her pass the day without fetching two buckets of water and sent Jenny to remind her instead.

“Jane…” the young woman’s face was paler than Jane remembered this afternoon, a trace of worry occupied it. “You probably shouldn’t take a nap when the day is bright.”

“That old nanny sent you here, wasn’t she?” when Jane’s question replied with a nod, she then quickly inquired, “and what do you mean I shouldn’t take a nap during the day?”

“It’s because you need to fall asleep as soon as possible when the night comes.”

Jane then said, “But I heard the Young Lady was having a nap.”

“Young Lady is different. She needs to stay awake during the night to keep watch.”

Jane thought the old nanny and the window scrubbing were being ridiculous, but only now she realized the rumored witless Young Lady just won the award. “An eight years old kid? To keep watch of what?” she asked mockingly.

It was clear the worried face of Jenny’s became panicked suddenly, as it was obvious she tried very hard to avoid replying to the question. “I think should you get exercise while you’re in here.”

“Now you’re starting to talking more nonsense--”

“Sssuuush!”

Jane was frowning as she didn’t welcome Jenny to cut her words.

But Jenny spoke again, with quieter whisperers and eyes brimming with conviction, saying, “You should’ve not thought too much while you’re here, Jane. You’ll know the things when they think you’re ready to know the things you want to know. And don’t say anything bad while you’re in front of Young Lady--never, ever!”

Jane could hear worry, concern, both mixed with terrible anxiety in Jenny’s voice. For a moment, her lips felt heavy when she tried to say something as a reply.

Jenny continued, “The only thing that could make your survive here is the Young Lady’s approval; do you have something as a gift for Young Lady?”

“A gift for Young Lady?” Jane balked.

She came here to work, not to socialize with eight years old brat of a noble young lady. It was obvious she didn’t expect this.

“Then here, take this.” Jenny put something on Jane’s palm.

“What’s this?”

“Something you’ll be presenting to the Young Lady this evening. Say that you bring it from outside with you.”

After saying that Jenny rushed off to leave, obvious she didn’t want to entertain Jane’s probing questions. Jane thought it was a shame, since even back in the main manor, Jenny was this kind of timid girl who was always found herself difficult to say _no_ to others’ requests.

Later after the noon, Jane learned how distrustful of the old nanny could be. As if sending Jenny wasn’t enough, the old woman also sent someone else to remind Jane about the water on the hill. At first Jane thought it was Emeralda, someone she knew back from the main manor--but it turned out to be that hateful window scrubbing maidservant who was waiting in front of her door--the girl came with, obviously, two empty buckets hanging on both of her hands.

Jane groaned and quickly grabbed a dry cloth as a mask and cover her nose and mouth with it.

“Oh, please, can you knock the door properly?” said her as she pulled open the door.

The other girl knitted her brows seeing Jane geared with mask. “I knocked the door,” she said.

“No, you were _banging_ the door.”

“Yes, banging, knocking--whatever you say. What’s with the mask though?”

With the tip of her fingers Jane tugged her cloth mask a bit, then said with an implicated sneer, “You don’t know? This is a basic practice to prevent the spread of virus. Outsiders ought to wear masks when interacting with people under quarantine--which, I should be doing sooner.”

“Does your mask imbued with holy magic?” the maidservant sneered back.

“Does I look that rich to you?” Jane sneered obviously.

“Then you’ll die,” the maidservant said slowly, “with mask or not, you’ll die in span of two weeks.”

Jane couldn’t hold back the girl’s morbid talks and snapped, “What’s wrong with you? Just look at the mirror, and see who’s going to die first here.”

The girl was silent. She didn’t look like she was distrubed by it, yet it was obvious she absorbed the words. This made Jane thought she was too blunt just now.

But then, the girl, with her flat expression she said, “That is maybe.” No more explanation followed, she just put the buckets she brought on the floor and turned around, said, “Senior told me to show you the way to get to the hill. Let’s go.”

“Ahh,” Jane quickly locked her room door and picked up the empty buckets, then followed the girl to get outside the mansion.
