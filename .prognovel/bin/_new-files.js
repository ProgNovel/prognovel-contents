### WEBMONETIZATION REVSHARE OPTIONS ###

# edit file site-contributors.yml to set up payments for website owners and staff

# when subscribers are reading novels, payment pointers for website owner
# and staffs will be limited to make spaces for novel authors and contributors
# revenue share.
#
# example: 30% limit means owners and staffs will receive 0.3x of their
# usual revenue for subscribers who reading novel, while the rest will be
# distributed among authors and their contributors (editors, proofreaders, illustrators, etc)
limit_global_payment_pointers_share_in_novel: 30%

# unlike global revshare, total revenue share rate for novel contributors
# will be accumulated for every chapters a person credited for
#
# example: authors who wrote 10 chapters with share of 5 will have
# 50 revshare weight, while editor who edits 5 chapter with share of 4
# will have 20 revshare weight
