Yesterday, he won a ghastly old encyclopedia nobody ever heard of. Today, the bet he eyed was silver coins. He didn’t know what he wanted from his opponent for tomorrow’s game. But the spirit in this dashing leather armor, adventurer-style, always wanted one thing for the game’s prize: taking control of the boy’s mortal body.</p>\n<p>More than a hundred games of chess later, the boy still got his healthy body intact, he never lost even once. And that made the spirit grow more dissatisfied as the days passing by.</p>\n<p>“Holy ff--! I clearly remember this damn bishop wasn’t there,” the spirit said. From the look of it, he was two moves away from getting his king owned.</p>\n<p>The boy clicked his tongue. He was hearing that kind of excuse every time the chess game came to its end.</p>\n<p>The spirit stubbornly closed the gap in his defense by sacrificing a rook. But soon, without taking a time to think, the boy casually moved his one horse, eating away the queen, sealing all the chance for the spirit to counter-attack.</p>\n<p>“Fuck this shit!!!”</p>\n<p>Enraged, the spirit flipped the chess board. About a dozen chess pieces hurled all side as they became the victims of the spirit’s frustration. The boy sighed. This was no good. Apparently he needed to be more considerate for the next game. He needed to pretend struggling before he crushed this impatient spirit so he didn’t feel cornered and ended up abandoning all these easy-money making games.</p>\n<p>“Hey,” the boy said. He tapped the flat-surfaced stone they used to lay the chess board before and reminded the spirit, almost as if he was saying “put the money here.”</p>\n<p>As annoyed as he was, the spirit could do nothing but give him a pouch of coins.</p>\n<p>“They are not kobes,” the boy said. “Shops and stalls in the village only accept kobe coins.”</p>\n<p>The spirit scoffed.</p>\n<p>“What do you know about it, brat. If you convert with the last week rate then you’ve got twice the shitty kobe you extort from me. Be glad about it.”</p>\n<p>“This won’t do, Ol’ Nalaq. The peddlers that come around here rarely accept strange currency. Neighbor country’s money is usually fine but I don’t think these coins would do. I don’t even know which country these coins are from.”</p>\n<p>“Then use it to add your savings,” the spirit said. “And don’t call me Nalaq. Don’t push your primitive tribal nonsense to me. Call me ‘Good-Natured Spirit’ as usual. I’m not like your usual Nalaqs, brat.”</p>\n<p>“It’s not tribal.” The boy didn’t show any sign of agreement. He didn’t know why this roguish-grinning spirit didn’t like to be called a Nalaq. The way southern Mossack people, like the boy himself, addressed spirits were usually by two terms: Nalaq and Selaq. As far as he knew Nalaq was a title worth to be proud of.</p>\n<novel-trivia label=”Lore”>\n<p>Nalaq were those of the spirit of fallen heroes and mages, had attained high-level of enlightenment to see ways to preserve souls across death. Whilst no longer to be alive, Nalaqs own their consciousness and retain their memories as well intelligence, though part of their original power diminished, especially those who relied on physical might during their prime.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Selaqs arose from death through unnatural causes, sometimes fueled by resentment and great energy of negativity. Though more powerful, their spirit didn’t dissipate because of strong, usually vile, emotions their harbour when they died, the restless spirits stuck in the limbo and returned back to the mortal world as hostile, mindless haunting spectres.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>Theoretically the spirit that currently playing chess was a Nalaq. He still got his consciousness, true. But, in a way, his intelligence seemed way apart from the Nalaqs southern Mossack tribes often revered in the past--that was what the boy had in mind when looking at this vulgar grinning spirit.</p>\n<p>“You’re not thinking something stupid about me, are you?” the spirit said with a snort as he realized the unexcited eyes the boy had as if he was looking at cow dung.</p>\n<p>“No, I was thinking just the usual--I was wondering about your very existence and your real identity.”</p>\n<p>“That so?” the spirit raised his chin. “Don’t need overthinking it, boy. Hehe. If you know even a piece of my name then you’d be amazed by how amazing I am. Everybody is my bitch when I’m still your age back then, hehe. That’s true.”</p>\n<p>“Hooohhh…” the boy half-heartedly nodded. As expected, every time he brought the topic about the spirit’s identity, all he got was empty talks, disgusting enough for him to regret for bringing up the topic. For now, the only joyous thing he got to do was counting the money he won from the chess game as the bullshit Good-Natured Spirit sang about his past tuning endlessly in the background.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Somewhere in Tiramikal Continent, far in the opposite side of the cold, barbaric northern lands, not too isolated from the bustling early-capitalistic empires of the western lands, and not too far away from the neighbor eastern lands of never-ending warfares between the eastern Kaya feudal lords, a village known as Badril Village was living peaceful for a number of years. The old blood the locals knew as Badril Village’s three big families rooted deeply these past one hundred years in spite of the thinning southern Mossack heritage. Despite slowly developing their rural village worthy of the westerner tourists and easterners refugees, the southern locals still taking pride in their Mossack hunters and gatherers ancestry. Exactly one year ago Good-Natured Spirit appeared in this humble village.󠆞</p>\n<p>On the wall of Yashura Family’s courtyard, which was ridiculously thick and tall for ordinary villages, the spirit took out a rolled paper of dried tobacco. This might not be common knowledge known only to limited people; for converting earthly materials to spiritual goods for Nalaqs to use, it could only be done in an expensive and complicated manner--usually performed in rituals by the royalties and great ancient clans for annual offerings to their ancestors. But the spirit in shabby leather armor did the converting for cigarettes and other trivial goods. Nobody knew how he did it. Even if they did, it’d be very hard to judge whether his quirk was worth to be admired or to be ridiculed at. Nevertheless he got this kind of air around him that telling people he didn’t care much about what they think.</p>\n<p>The street below the wall were children below ages of ten playing with sticks and chasing each other. When a crowd of housewives came, his eyes, sharp as an eagle’s, sweeping through in search of prey. One of his habit that obviously he brought with him since he was alive was to oogle women, especially for young wives and pretty middle-aged aunties interesting big breasts and interesting big butts. Despite his sighing and occasional annoying tongue-clicking, though, those wives and children didn’t turn their heads toward him. They didn’t even know a lecher ghost was there haunting the street. A Nalaq couldn’t be seen by common folks by default. Unless he wanted to, no one would realize there was a suspicious spirit ogling for women that were passing by.</p>\n<p>There was a young woman he knew trotted the street. Good-Natured Spirit knew her. She was neither a wife nor she was an aunty. Her butt and breasts sizes were also not worth being fusing about. The name was Mila Yashura, seventeen years old since last month. She was the older cousin of the boy he lost playing chess to.</p>\n<p>“Aunty,” Mila greeted an aunty by lowering her head, “did you see my cousin Shira around here?”</p>\n<p>The local wife she asked shook her head. Mila Yashura said a polite thanks and continued searching for her cousin.</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit swept the street with his eyes, looking for something. When he saw a certain manservant he stopped. Using his spiritual knife, he dismantled a small pebble from the stone wall he sat on, flicked it using his thumb and knocked the manservant’s head with it.</p>\n<p>“Ouch!” the manservant cried.</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura abruptly turned her head and saw a manservant of her Yashura Family holding his head. She briskly coming to him and asked the same question she threw to the aunty before.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira?” the manservant glanced at the direction of the hill behind Yashura Family’s wall. “I saw him walking there at noon. But whether he has returned or not I don’t know.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you. That’s good enough. Here, treat yourself some coffee beans before the peddlers set for the next village.”</p>\n<p>The hill behind the Yashura Family’s dwelling was originally a place where the family members brought the family’s goats to graze its green grasses. But under the current patriarch’s management, the family’s fortunate mostly put on investing on coconut plantations, thus some grazing places were left unused.</p>\n<p>“Shira! So here’s you holing yourself. I’ve been searching you for nearly an hour,” Mila saw how her cousin who was two years younger than her enjoying himself lying under a shadowy tree, using his arms as pillows. She kicked his foot, yelling him to get up, but Shira merely changed his position and groaned in protest.</p>\n<p>“This buffon…” Mila hissed. “You know how the fact you’re lazing around everyday breeds all those crappy rumors, don’t you?”</p>\n<p>“People can talk whatever they want as long as they don’t bother me,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“But they bother our family!”</p>\n<p>Mila inhaling a deep breath. Now her voice getting higher annoyingly and she continued, “You’re the young master of our family, you lazy pig. The nearest in-line to inherit the patriarch title! You may don’t give a shit about your reputation now but if you are to take the leader's mantle from my father then all the crap they said would certainly bite your ass in the future! You hear?!”</p>\n<p>Shira picked his ear coolly. He might not know anything about the future, but certainly his cousin’s annoying nagging was biting his ass at this moment.</p>\n<p>“What are you doing alone in this kind of place anyway?”</p>\n<p>“You might not believe it, but I’m making a fortune here,” Shira said. Of course, whenever he played a game of chess with a spirit invisible to ordinary humans, he needed a quiet place where nobody was around. This was a perfect place for him.</p>\n<p>But Mila winced her eyes. A few seconds later, she turned her head, catching a canvas filled with rough sketches resting on the tree.</p>\n<p>“By painting?”</p>\n<p>“Sometimes that too.” Shira knew a bit about drawing scenery and people, so even with his limited interpersonal connection as an introvert he could make some money with his painting. However, his casual reply got Mila in a bad mood instead. Suddenly Shira remembered the embarrassing accident two months ago when Mila found an unfinished commision from a certain good-for-nothing spirit that he had carefully hidden in his house. When people commissioned a no-name painter they mostly asked for a portrait or image they deemed interesting. What kind of images Good-Natured Spirit found interesting? Women, of course. Especially those with big butts and big breasts. He liked them in thin, slipping clothings as if those vulnerable ladies were stuck in a very dangerous situation. In other words, erotic paintings.</p>\n<p>Then, sighing at the explosive nagging coming his way, Shira took a stick he slipped on his right ear and presented it as a bribe. Ancient southern Mossacks used berries and some used squid inks as pigments, but after waves of outside influence they started using quills and brushes, depending on the regions. Pencils, although practical, were introduced by a certain Nalaq spirit and Shira hadn’t heard anyone using it beside himself. The stick he used as a bribe was exactly a pencil. It sharpened many times and half-way on its way before he needed another one. Shira thought, maybe he should extort some more pencils for the next match from Good-Natured Spirit.</p>\n<p>Mila furrowed. She knew about the pencil and its value not too long ago thus, as expected, she grabbed it shamelessly. “What? Do you think you can escape only with this?”</p>\n<p>“I planned to give you something else but I think you’d rather like this simple bribe anyway.”</p>\n<p>Shira wanted to simply give her money to make her shut up. But the coins he had on him now only in form of foreign currency--the coins he extorted from Good-Natured Spirit from the last chess game. The boy frowned. Beside nagging him at full force, what did Mila coming here for?</p>\n<p>“Yeah, that reminds me, the news I wanted to tell you!” Mila finally snapped out of her nagging mode. “That Malikh girl! Your fiancée! After two years abroad! She’s finally coming home!”</p>\n<p>“Ohh…” the reply was anticlimactic.</p>\n<p>“Ohh? What the fuck with that reply?”</p>\n<p>“You don’t mind me. I just already burn out when people compare me with her,” Shira said. Although their age were the same, this young lady of Malikh Family was famous even in the nearby villages and town as a talent, with a promising look that might make her a beauty worth dying for. The old generations called her treasure and the boys loved her as the village princess. She went abroad two years ago for a series of seminars after an official from the capital scouted her talent. Now that she returned, everybody was fervently talking about her. But for Shira Yashura, the boy who was supposed to be the fiancé, even that kind of news wasn’t enough to make him get up from his comfortable napping.</p>\n<p>“My father wants to talk with you,” Mila said, “get up now.”</p>\n<p>“What about?”</p>\n<p>“You still asking?”</p>\n<p>The boy had a premonition that a troublesome matter would be waiting for him. Mila gave him an ultimatum before she wandered off to do her own things.</p>\n<p>“Hehe, what’s this fiancée I heard just now?” Good-Natured Spirit popped out his head from a tree beside Shira.</p>\n<p>“It’s not what you think,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“Oh yeah?” Good-Natured Spirit nudged the boy with his elbow. “I heard that chick is a hella beauty. Hehe, I bet her luggages is in good-quality, you know what I mean?”</p>\n<p>“From whom did you hear that?”</p>\n<p>“Doesn’t matter who. When it comes to chick my radar is very sensitive, eh. I’m curious. Did you benefit from this engagement thingy? Benefit, know what I mean?”</p>\n<p>Shira clicked his tongue. “Like I said, it’s not what you think it is. Our parents set us up and it’s been a mess since the talks about engagement got out.”</p>\n<p>Talking some sense to this good-for-nothing Nalaq was futile. Good-Natured Spirit kept teasing him. “You haven’t seen her for two years, have you? The talks I’ve been hearing down there real hairy, brat. I mean… especially those luggages of hers, know what I mean? Know what I mean? Nudge nudge. Nudge nudge,” he winked. “Wanna check on her?”</p>\n<p>“I need to go back. My uncle wants to talk with me.”</p>\n<p>“Alright then,” Good-Natured Spirit nodded as he rubbed his chin. “I’ll check the chick myself.”</p>\n<p>Carrying the canvas and the chess with him, Shira warned the Nalaq, “You better not do anything funny to her, hear me?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho. Jealous?”</p>\n<p>“I just don’t want their entire family coming right after me with pitchforks just because yo do something stupid.”</p>\n<p>After he said that Shira Yashura turned around. He started to walk down the hill. Good-Natured Spirit saw the boy walk without caring for the world, then he set off to check the girl by himself with a chuckle that escaped from his mouth.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A few hours later the said fiancée showed herself in a public training field. The field, owned by the most influential family in Badril Village--the Elzhier Family--was neatly arranged with archery targets and provided with dulled swords for the teenagers trained themselves or doing mock battles. The Elzhiers sent some menservants occasionally to act as security in case conflicts would occur. Today, the young master of the said family himself, nicknamed Bony, guarded the entrance along with two of his lackeys.</p>\n<p>“I’ve got to pay you to enter?!” a young man gawked at the sudden irregularity regarding the training field’s rules. “What’s this? The field is supposed to be free for everyone!”</p>\n<p>“Well, man, gotta pay for maintenance cost,” one of the lackeys, called Pilek, said as he rubbed his nose.</p>\n<p>“One silver kobe! Heh, maintenance cost my ass! Nobody would pay for this bullshit.”</p>\n<p>“Nobody? You wrong, man,” another lackey called Polio pointed at the crowd inside the training field with a gesture of his head. The girl from the Malikh Family causing a big ruckus from her arrival alone. She attracted boys like a bright lamp attracted fireflies. Because of that, the three deliquents in the entrance for nearly half an hour had been amassing quite a fortune till now.</p>\n<p>“I’ll definitely send complaints to Elzhier Family now. Just because your father is the village head you think you can do whatever you want, eh?” the young man snorted, sending a glare to them.</p>\n<p>The Elzhier Family’s young master, who had been watching with his back resting on the wall and his arms crossed, decided to open his mouth, he said, “Pay or get lost.”</p>\n<p>“Hear that? Boss Bony has spoken,” Pilek glared back at the young man with his head tilted. “Better get lost now or else…”</p>\n<p>“Or else!” Polio emphasized with a higher voice.</p>\n<p>The three of them had been infamous in the village despite being heirs to their respective families. Naturally, though they were the same age, only an idiot would butting head directly with the heir of Elzhier Family. Thus the young man snorted, unwillingly turned and walked away.</p>\n<p>“What the heck is that?” Pilek didn’t like the way that young man snorted at them. “We should teach bastards like him a few good lessons one of these days.”</p>\n<p>“You’re right,” Polio added.</p>\n<p>“Just ignore that bum,” Bony said.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, the next onlookers came. Not boys, but two girls to be exact. They carried bags of dirty clothes with them as they were on their way to wash the clothes at the river.</p>\n<p>“Well, I’d be damned,” one of the girls, a young lady named Romana, said, “I’ve been hearing about the rumors but looking at that Malikh girl, damn…. Look at how she did with her hair, Mila.”</p>\n<p>They could see what was happening in the field even from the entrance. The two girls looked at a certain girl who was surrounded by boys. The other girl, Mila Yashura, furrowed her brows at the current appearance of her cousin’s fiancée. She kept her mouth shut despite the anger on her eyes.</p>\n<p>“She cut her hair short despite being engaged to your cousin,” Romana said to Mila. “What’s that supposed to mean?”</p>\n<p>It was a custom of southern Mossack people for women to cut their hair short to tell the opposite sex they currently unavailable. Mostly widows who weren’t ready to be courted again chose to cut their hair that way. However, since the young lady of Malikh Family was currently engaged, the act of cutting her hair short was confusing to people.</p>\n<p>From the three delinquents who had been hearing their conversations, Pilek butted in, “Yo, ladies, don’t think too much about it. We southern people been foreigners with this fiancé-and-fiancée business. We practical people, y’know? Southerners the kind of people who would do it first then talking ‘bout marriage later. A chance she might not know what she was doing.”</p>\n<p>Romana rolled her eyes. Knowing Mila Yashura was here, she wished this stupid cheerful delinquent wouldn’t say what he had said. In fact, better for him to not open his mouth. She hated him whenever he opened his mouth and said pointless things.</p>\n<p>Her and Mila’s goal was to check about the rumor regarding the fiancée’s short hair. They didn’t have the intention to enter the training field and mingle with those crowdy horny boys, lest talking with these shameless thugs who clearly act as bandits.</p>\n<p>“Let’s go, Mila,” Romana whispered as she realized Mila had been glaring at the three delinquents. Moving her eyes from Mila, she looked at Bony who was in between his two lackeys. She whispered again, “you can’t fight him like you used to. He got a Knight class now. People said he can even fight another Knight with four level above him. Let’s just forget about it.”</p>\n<p>Last time Mila and Bony fought was three years ago. Her punch made his nose bleed but that was the end of it. It was a hot topic for a while and most didn’t know what happened but the long enmity between the two of them suddenly dropped cold and they had been avoiding each other. Seeing how the other party was quite well, Mila Yashura grimaced. They were Novices back then but now, after both of them ascended the first level barrier and got themselves class titles, there was no way a support-class Specialist like her could deliver that kind of punch again to his face.</p>\n<p>“Mm. Let’s go,” Mila said to Romana. No matter how brave and reckless she was, as a non-combatant talent, she knew better than to sow another discord with the village’s young generation’s strongest.</p>\n<p>Pilek, the most cheerful in Bony’s group, who was actually the most friendly, waved his hand to the girls as they walked away. Neither of them bothered with him.</p>\n<p>“Ahhh, my sister’s been avoiding me lately,” Pilek grumbled. Romana, Mila’s friend, was actually his half-sister from different mother. He was a proud big brother when they were young, until their mothers had a fight and his half-sister moved into a separate house.</p>\n<p>“Pilek,” Bony called.</p>\n<p>“Yes boss?”</p>\n<p>“You should’ve kept your mouth shut.”</p>\n<p>Pilek wryly smiled and nodded. Polio also thought his friend Pilek couldn’t read between the line. Although Pilek’s remark was well-intentioned, it’d just make things worse for Bony. The bad mood from back three years ago still left after taste that made him and her uncomfortable dealing with each other.</p>\n<p>After that, more people were coming to see the young lady of Malikh Family.</p>\n<p>The talks and speculations about her hair made the boys think she was dissatisfied with her engagement with Shira Yashura. Thus giving them hopes to snatch her away. It was no exaggeration to say that most of the boys fell for her, especially after they saw how the young lady grew beautifully. They surrounded this girl who had this icy expression on her face, though she herself greatly concentrated on holding a bow and an arrow, eyes straight to the archery target dozens of meters from her. She shot. And when the arrow hit splendidly, the boys would cheer and fawn all over her. The girl kept her face cold despite the flooding flattery coming at her way.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” a young man in his early twenty stepped forward from the bunch of admirers and confidently said, “I see you have this different aura about you. Something special that I can’t quite get my fingers on it, and I can’t help but feel curious about you.”</p>\n<p>That was supposed to be a pick-up line, but Bhela Malikh replied straightforwardly, “I changed. Now I’m Level 10 and not a Novice anymore.”</p>\n<p>“Oooohhhh!!” the crowd was surprised. Reaching the first barrier and got a class title at fifteen years old was the second time in these two decades. The first one was Bony. However, considering the girl was quite a talent enough for people in the capital to notice her, there was a high chance for her to snatch the crown as Badril Village’s young generation’s strongest from Bony sooner than everyone expected.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” the young man called for her attention again, despite his first attempt at hitting on her was an utter failure. “I see your beautiful sharp eyes and beautiful nimble hands and your beautiful pretty face. The class you’ve got must be… a beautiful <b>Archer</b>, right?”</p>\n<p>“I am an archer,” Bhela replied tight-lipped. Well, it was obvious when she picked a bow the first thing she arrived here.</p>\n<p>“Ah, a beautiful and talented Archer then! It’s a pity, though for such a fine beautiful flower like yourself to be thrown into a heap of cow dung…”</p>\n<p>The remark made Bhela Malikh raise her brows. She somehow could predict where the topic was going to be directed.</p>\n<p>“That stupid engagement is what I say! How could a diamond such as yourself be forced to marry a trash from Yashura Family?”</p>\n<p>He sighed like he pitied the harsh fate of the beauty. And though unlikeable as he was, the murmurs of the crowd seemingly agreed with him. At that point, someone said, “That’s true. Even my ten years old nephew is one Level above him. Such trash to become…”</p>\n<p>The words stopped, Bhela looked at the person who said that. “The one from Yashura Family--he’s still a Level 3 Novice?”</p>\n<p>It was someone else who replied to her question. “Ah, yes, he’s stuck and made no progress even since Young Lady Bhela went outside the village. Everyone calls him The Eternal Novice.”</p>\n<p>And this made her raised brows turned into a frown. Going by the crowd, for a Level 5 Novice by fifteen years old was already considered slow progress even by the standard of rural places like Badril Village. Mostly at that age the youngsters already reached Level 7, the diligent ones could reach Level 8 with hard work. Faster than that, not counting usage of an unreasonable amount of growth-hack potions--which most children from rich noble families did, could be considered a talent amongst the younger generation. However, to think of a boy one year before his own coming-of-age ceremony coming still stuck at such low-level talent, even though if he was the heir of Badril Village’s major families, people would still call him trash, even in public.</p>\n<p>“Ah, Young Lady Bhela! You don’t have to bother yourself with such eyesore trash. I know you’re troubled with the careless arrangement your father made, but if we put our mind to it, we can--”</p>\n<p>All was well until the young man put bad words about her father. Never did he expect that the girl would mercilessly retract her hand just before the tips of their fingers touched.</p>\n<p>“Please don’t pretend you were familiar with me,” that was what she said.</p>\n<p>The rain of snickers rang all around him. Despite him glaring left and right in an intimidating manner, there was no way for him to suppress the crowd from humiliating him further. At the time he realized the chance for him to court the Young Lady of Malikh Family, the sole daughter of the Malikh Family Patriarch, was pitifully close to nothing. Thus, in a moment of spontaneity, he thought of a scheme to save his face and sounded it with a flash of desperate smirk plastered on his face. He grabbed a bow and said, “I see Young Lady Bhela rather reserved toward us long friends after two years abroad. Hmm, yeah, this is a perfect chance, by the way. I’m an Archer too, see. So why not this senior teach you a thing or two? Seventy meters--perhaps a good learning experience for young lady, no?”</p>\n<p>The surrounding began chattering lively. It was obvious it was a challenge as Archers. And the young man’s smirk turned more and more confident at the girl’s unresponsiveness. No matter how much potential talent one had, time and experience playing a vital role in assessing one’s current performance whether she was Archer or Priest or Knight or other classes. Skills, abilities one acquired after reaching the first barrier and getting a new class title could only progress with constant tempering in battle and improved alongside one’s level. The young man was a Level 12 Archer. So theoretically, a Level 10 new Archer like Bhela Malikh would need a few more years before she could beat the opponent in a fair competition.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh was annoyed. She glared at the ones who were supposed to be guarding the field. But Bony and his lackeys were busy counting coins. For Bhela, the crowd were a bunch of stupid annoying busybodies who prevented her to train in peace. But for Bony and his lackeys the crowd was simply a bunch of gold mines.</p>\n<p>“Please watch closely how I do it, Young Lady Bhela. See my elbow? If you could do the same way I do it, I’m sure your archery skill would improve significantly.”</p>\n<p>No one really bothered with the ‘humble direction’ the young man spouted. Bhela didn’t spare him a glance. She looked straight to target seventy meters from where she was standing. Repressing his anger, the young man began to shoot three arrows one by one splendidly; the final one landed right in the center of the target that was marked in red dot.</p>\n<p>He was satisfied with the result. Glancing at the young lady, this young man wanted to utter more words to improve his image. However, right before he opened his mouth, he found Bhela already drew her arrow, released it, and it hit one arrow splendidly. Not just hitting the target, but an arrow the young man previously shot. The second was the same. And the final third arrow also hit the arrow on the red dot.</p>\n<p>What was that? She used a skill? The young man wanted to object but his tongue froze and his lips quivered. Did she use <b>Far Sight</b> skill that enhanced eye-sight a hundred of meters away? Did she use <b>Boost Accuracy</b>, the skill that was supposedly forbidden to be used in duel between Archers? To think of beating him, an Archer older than her and 2 Level right above her, in such a devastating manner… she must be cheating, right?</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” the defeated young man said weakly, “I didn’t use my mana between my shots.”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh nodded.</p>\n<p>“Neither was I.”</p>\n<p>With that, Bhela turned around and left the crowd of dumbfounded boys with steps full of grace. She approached the entrance, returned back the bow she used to the three delinquents who just let people mess with her training and said coldly, “If this is how the famous Young Master Elzhier manages his property, then there’s no need for me to come here again. Please excuse me.”</p>\n<p>Bony’s expression didn’t change much as he still crossed his arms and rested his back casually on the wall.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Pilek, the one received the returned bow from Bhela, waved his hand again and shouted, “Take care, princess!”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Because she couldn’t train her archery peacefully in public, Bhela returned back to Malikh Family and trained in her private training place.</p>\n<p>It was originally a backyard turned archery ground, made by Malikh Family Patriarch after knowing his daughter showed interest in archery. It was nothing fancy. It was spacious and good enough when she started with her first bow but now Bhela felt the place was lacking. At most, she had to live with the meager fifty meters range maximum. Therefore, the practice she had made a habit of had to wait.</p>\n<p>Therefore, Bhela Malikh decided to put her mind over something else than her usual practice instead.</p>\n<p>She drew a deep breath. A table was provided with dozens of arrows laid on top of it. Bhela picked four at the same time, nocked them on her bow string. She began to aim.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the air surrounding her changed. Her inexperience as a newly Novice-graduate showed by the obvious mana that leaked from the inside out. With naked eyes, her mana looked calm colorful haze that consisted of four bold colors, tangling and struggling with each other for dominance. Her eyelashes quivered. Channeling mana to cast a skill she yet had mastered felt like trying to stand on the raging sea waves while she herself was being a weak newborn.</p>\n<p><em>Whhhhuuuuushh--</em></p>\n<p><em>Shuuuhsh--</em></p>\n<p><em>Ssshhhuuuush--</em></p>\n<p><em>Wwhuuuussh!!</em></p>\n<p>The fastest arrow, coated with sparking yellow-colored mana, hit one of the targets at around forty meters range. But the others performed pitifully. The one infused with wet blue-colored mana didn’t even reach two-third of the desired range. The green-colored one, an arrow infused with mana that generated unstable wind trajectory flew far far away, as if it was getting swallowed by the sky, never to be seen again. The last one, the red-colored arrow, was horrifying. It hit the training ground fence instead the target. The bamboo fences suddenly set ablaze by raging flames as soon as the said arrow came into contact with them.</p>\n<p><em>Clap clap clap!</em></p>\n<p>Uninvited claps resounded across the training ground. On the wall Good-Natured Spirit clapping after watching a good spectacle. For getting hand claps from a Nalaq like him, naturally the level of talent Bhela showed just now was far beyond ordinary.</p>\n<p>“Thank you…” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>It appeared she knew beforehand the four-arrows skill she shot would make a mess. So she gathered the maidservants and made them extinguish the fences that started to burn into ashes. “Thank you, thank you for your hard work,” she said to a pair of maidservants who briskly went back and forth to kill the fire before its spread.</p>\n<p>“Ah! Young lady, what skill was that just now?” one of the maidservants gawked after the fire was extinguished.</p>\n<p>“That wasn’t just your ordinary Archer skill, was it?” added the other.</p>\n<p>Summoning a blazing fire just with an arrow and pure mana was unheard of. At least, the maidservants knew nobody in the village could do that.</p>\n<p>Bhela drank a glass of murky liquify herbs mixed with mint to cool down her manasphere. “It’s something I learned when I was away,” she said after putting down the glass on the tray her maid servants provided. She continued, “I still can’t master it, though.”</p>\n<p>She cast her eyes at the unharmed targets one by one. Shooting at forty meters range was still too much for her using four arrows at the same time. When the maidservants realized her difficulty, they encouraged her to simplify it and shoot one arrow at a time. However at their suggestion, Bhela shook her head. “It’s the requirement of this skill I’ve got to shoot four arrows,” she explained.</p>\n<p>The maidservants nodded at her words and apologized for their shallow suggestion.</p>\n<p>“Don’t mind that,” Bhela waved her hand. “There’s something I heard from people, by the way. Something about Young Master Yashura.”</p>\n<p>The two maidservants glanced at each other before one of them replied. “The rumor says… he holed up from the public’s view because he’s ashamed he can’t even become a Level 4 Novice.”</p>\n<p>“Are the Yashura Family elders still favoring him as the heir of Yashura Family Patriarch?”</p>\n<p>“We don’t know whether they still favor him or not. But Yashura Family always united in their standing. So unless the current Patriarch of Yashura Family has a son, the Young Master Shira Yashura will undoubtedly become the next patriarch.”</p>\n<p>“No rumors about the Yashura Family elders wavering then?”</p>\n<p>The maidservants shook their heads altogether.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela… apologize for giving you my shallow suggestion once again but…” one of the maidservants came near to Bhela and whispered, “With him as the heir, Yashura Family’s future will be bleak. Everyone in our family said your father’s bad condition is a bad omen for us mingling with those simple Yashuras. I’m very sorry if this sounds impudent--but you should’ve better cut ties with them before too late, young lady. Madam was too grieved by your father’s ill health to make decisions thus the only one who can save our Malikh Family is you.”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at the maidservant. The glint on her eyes changed.</p>\n<p>“There’s already a plan laid to help our Malikh Family,” that was all Bhela said. “You better not say something like that again. You lucky no one here beside me to hear you utter that kind of words.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you for your mercy, young lady! We are sorry for being impudent!”</p>\n<p>They decided to make it history with only the four of them who knew the previous conversation. The four of them; the young lady and two maid servants and one Nalaq spirit who came here uninvited.</p>\n<p>“It seems I just heard something I shouldn’t hear,” Good-Natured Spirit said while he rubbed his chin. He came here peeking. He didn’t have the intention to reveal himself while the girls below had a secret conversation ignorant of his presence.</p>\n<p>After that Bhela continued with light training. Good-Natured Spirit watched her doing simple shooting, she didn’t even use a slightest of her mana from then on. Yawning, Good-Natured Spirit stood up. Then he flew away from Malikh Family and began to look for some other interesting thing to sate his boredom.</p>\n<hr>\n<authors-note id=\"Radhy\">\n<p>Testing, testing.

Upon reporting back to the head maid for her old post, she was told that there was a new girl who already filled it--and for her to continue to work in Blackwood Family, there was no other way except for coming to work as the Blackwood Family’s young lady’s private attendant.</p>\n<p>Being an attendant of someone from the main bloodline from a mere common maidservant was a promotion--normally. It was different when it came to the Young Lady of Blackwood Family. Just when Jane thought she had just received bad luck due to her unfaithful partner, another worse luck hit her hard.</p>\n<p>“Head maid! Please, anything but there!” she promptly cling on the head maid’s legs. “Don’t send me to Young Lady’s place, please so something for me to get my old post back, we’re sisters for years, head maid! Please, do me a favor--just this once!”</p>\n<p>“Jane, don’t be foolish, the new girl is Butler Tim’s niece. They’ve been waiting for a post to be empty to slip her in the past two months. Do you think I could get it back that easily?”</p>\n<p>“H-head maid…” Jane knew, although Butler Tim didn’t have enough influence to be a tyrant in Blackwood Family’s manor, still not someone Jane could afford to offend. Biting her bottom lip, she whispered, “Please, head maid… if I perished due to bad luck, how could my family pay their debts?”</p>\n<p>“Get up now. Didn’t you say you have a way to pay it without working here for a dozen years more?”</p>\n<p>“That was before,” Jane’s voice was hoarse, “I never would’ve thought that bastard only spout empty promises of taking care of my family and other bullshit. Maybe it’s my lucky star that the bastard didn’t manage to make me pregnant after all this time!”</p>\n<p>“Now you know better than rely your future on nauseating romance, so I’m going to tell you, Jane--second chances are hard to get, you need to grasp it if one appears in front of you.”</p>\n<p>“But wouldn’t it be my last chance I’m to serve Young Lady Blackwood? Everybody’s ended up dead after they were sent to Young Lady’s place!”</p>\n<p>“Nonsense. Emeralda and Jenny are still alive and well these past six months there.”</p>\n<p>“Their death is only a matter of time!”</p>\n<p>Head maid sighed.</p>\n<p>“Jane oh Jane, I’m sending you not because I want to see your demise. You’re hardworking girl albeit annoying, how come I want you to die?”</p>\n<p>Jane already feeling numb being called names by this woman ten years her senior. Though in her heart she cursed head maid with nicknames like old virgin or such, she still desperate enough for tears falling down her cheeks. “Head maid, what do you mean by that?”</p>\n<p>“Don’t you know Sir Arden Blackwood had inquired about young lady’s place a few times recently?” head maid asked her with enigmatic smile.</p>\n<p>Jane blinked. She immediately came to head maid as soon as she knew her old post being taken and didn’t have time to gossip with other maidservants. “Really, head maid, you know I just came back. Don’t talk in a roundabout way…”</p>\n<p>“Sir Arden is going to hire an expert to clear plague in our Young Lady’s mansion, he’s planning to do it in a month's time,” the head maid said. “You know Sir Arden’s reputation, and you know how reliable his words are. Go serve Young Lady there--by the time Sir Arden comes with the hired expert, he’ll be grateful for loyal servants who willing to accompany his niece in her difficult time!”</p>\n<p>Hearing the urge behind head maid’s tone, Jane choked by her own cry from earlier. Even Madam Blackwood had to be polite to this younger brother of hers--as the man’s reputation was the sole reason Madam could be so tyrannical on ruling the house. But even then Sir Arden was too lazy to pay attention to his sister and her be. Jane, a mere maidservant--could she really gain Sir Arden Blackwood’s favor?</p>\n<p>The head maid continued, “What are you hesitating for? Even Floria that girl who even prettier than you couldn’t even get Sir Arden to glance at her--do you think any girl can have the same chance as yours right now?” she paused, learning the contour of Jane’s expression before she said again, “even if you can’t be his mistress, Jane, I assure you that even Butler Tim won’t be able to touch your position if Sir Arden Blackwood has a good impression on you.”</p>\n<p>Jane lowered her head. Head maid was right. A chance to get on Sir Arden Blackwood’s good side wouldn’t come as easily as this.</p>\n<p>She calculated the weight and found that, since two of her friends were sent to serve Young Lady Blackwood six month ago and still survive, a good odd that Sir Arden Blackwood would rescue her before the disease from Young Lady’s cursed bad luck would take her life for good.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>There was no need for her to prepare anything. Her luggage was ready since she didn’t get to visit her old dorm. The head maid even was generous to give Jean a gift money from her own pocket, making Jean feel less regret about how things turned out.</p>\n<p>To get into the young lady’s personal mansion, Jane already followed a quiet middle-aged steward with an old carriage pulled by an old mare, which had an appearance that was nothing fancy since the steward’s job all these past two years were only replenishing goods and food supplies. The mansion was originally the noble family’s vacation site, so the distance between the main mansion wasn’t trivial. It required almost the whole day to get there with the quiet steward’s creaky old carriage.</p>\n<p>When they about to arrive at the old mansion that hosted the Blackwood Family’s young lady, the quiet steward spoke, “The conditions of your colleagues aren’t good. We still haven’t yet sure of the epidemic’s epicenter, but we know there’s something wrong with nearby plants or water sources from the well in backyard of that mansion, so it’s best if you follow what the senior servant’s words from here forward.”</p>\n<p>Jane curled her lips sourly. This steward talked as if he was sincerely giving advice, yet for those in the main manor who didn’t know the rumors about their young lady? The thought spread amongst the servants since for these past three years the young lady was the sole survivor despite many of the servants being wiped out just by staying beside her in a month’s time.</p>\n<p>Arriving at the destination welcoming them were a pair of pale-faced maidservants waiting at the gate. Both were somehow familiar. A moment later, Jane was stupefied when she found out that the two white doll-like girls with black eyebags on them were actually Emeralda and Jenny she had known back since her first year being a maidservant. No longer Jane could see two noise sisters of hers who always skipped work to gossip, only two sets of dead eyes left, seeing her but not with greeting eyes, almost like strangers.</p>\n<p>“Welcome,” Emeralda greeted with a flat tone.</p>\n<p>“Welcome,” the other girl repeated. No enthusiasm could be hear within their voices, as if they were greeting a stranger before them.</p>\n<p>Jane didn’t expect this. Six months of serving in this damned mansion indeed could change gossip friends into strangers. Even when she tried to strike a conversation what replied her were business-like formal speech. In the end, the only thing Jane could do was pretend to be busy helping the quiet steward unload the carriage.</p>\n<p>Both Jenny and Emeralda probably were chosen to welcome her because their familiarity with each other. At least, when they noticed her was there. There were one other maidservant and one old nanny beside them, whom, when Jane tried to greet them, didn’t even bat an eye and continued to be busy sweeping a clean place instead.</p>\n<p>“Listen, you,” the quiet steward approached Jane after he done unloading supplies and about to return back to the city, “I will come back one week after this to replenish the kitchen. If you’ve got any questions, ask them directly to the old nanny who’s taking care of the young lady. Other maidservants are occupied. It’s best for you not to disturb them when they are busy.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” Jane replied, said nothing else. There was nothing she could say anyway, especially when she saw the usually lazy friends of hers became strangers and suspiciously diligent instead--they were so diligent that they spent the afternoon circling the yard looking for hidden dry leaves to sweep.</p>\n","unregistered":[]},"novels/yashura-legacy/contents/volume-1/chapter-10.md":{"contributions":{},"lastModified":1589309313040,"data":{"title":"Bountiful Badril Mountain"},"body":"<p>Shuro Yashura had a little black cow friend he called Beefy. Beefy was a high grade cow born from a superior breed that was the best cow Yashura Family could afford in these past decades. Days upon days, Shuro Yashura would be laughing across the barley field as Beefy chasing him from behind. They played, they were best friends forever. Shuro Yashura loved Beefy. No one could break them apart. For years, it was Shuro Yashura’s lifetime dream to make the greatest beef rendang ever from Beefy’s meat.</p>\n<p>“Until then, we’ll be best friends forever!” Shuro Yashura exclaimed, patting Beefy’s firm fatty meat, while wondering what kind of delicious texture Beefy’s meat was going to offer.</p>\n<p>But happy time was short. Soon, incoming evil approached in the form of Elder Fhantir.</p>\n<p>“Patriarch Shuro, we need to repair our wall but we’re dirt poor. We don’t have any choice.”</p>\n<p>Shuro Yashura instinctively took a step back, protecting Beefy’s fatty body. “What do you mean, Elder Fhantir?”</p>\n<p>Elder Fhantir’s face formed an evil grin.</p>\n<p>“We need to sell Beefy!”</p>\n<p>Shuro Yashura gasped.</p>\n<p>“Beefy, noooooooo--”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro abruptly opened his eyes.</p>\n<p>“Beefy!”</p>\n<p>Short on his breath, Patriarch Shuro found himself sweating in his bed. He looked around his bedroom, confused. In the same room he saw his wife tidying clothes, and was looking at him strangely.</p>\n<p>“Oh, dear, are you having a nightmare?” his wife asked.</p>\n<p>“Nightmare?” Patriarch Shuro wiped sweat off his face. “Yeah, yeah, nightmare. It was only a nightmare. Heaven, I really thought Elder Fhantir’s gonna sell my Beefy…”</p>\n<p>Relieved, Patriarch Shuro lying his head again on the pillow. He had been under heavy stress that he encountered a really, really terrifying nightmare. He needed a good rest.</p>\n<p>However, just when he was about to sleep happily again, his wife said, “But isn’t Elder Fhantir going to sell all of our cows to Elzhier Family today?”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro, who was already smiling comfortably preparing to fall asleep for the second time, abruptly opened his bloodshot eyes.</p>\n<p>“BEEEFFY, NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!”</p>\n<p>Shira was a neighbor to his uncle’s house. He just locked his door when he heard his uncle screaming this morning.</p>\n<p>“What now…” he sighed.</p>\n<p>Though he had something to do this morning, Shira thought it best if he checked out how his uncle was doing. After all, his uncle was left devastated after Elder Fhantir decided to sell off the entire family’s cows.</p>\n<p>The main family’s houses in Yashura didn’t have any excotic decoration nor they had expensive decoration, but their style of home for living strikingly different than the common family members’ houses. As Yashura Family was the most conservative family than the two other major families, their taste in everyday architecture leaned more on the traditional side, as seen in the Patriarch’s main house still use old staged, wooden home style that installed two feet tall stairs to reached the door--the style of house that were commonly found in places where monsters swarm frequently struck, just like Badril Village was a few decades ago. The only thing that made Patriarch’s house different than simple folks’ staged house was the entire wooden house varnished with saps of lacquer trees, down to its wooden floor. When Shira visited his uncle’s house, he noticed the brazier in the yard was still sparking embers. He picked a wild twig and put out the fire as to save charcoal, thinking that Mila who usually put out this brazier as one of her her daily errands must be still asleep for her to miss this out.</p>\n<p>Shira then knocked on the door. “Uncle, aunt, can I come in?”</p>\n<p>“The door is not locked,” a voice said, not from inside, but from the veranda where Shira was standing.</p>\n<p>“Mila?”</p>\n<p>“I’m here.” Apparently, Mila, whom Shira didn’t notice when he climbed the two feet tall stairs onto the veranda, was sitting there in the corner near the window.</p>\n<p>“What the hell are you doing…” Shira sighed as he squatted before a blob of bedsheet.</p>\n<p>Mila covered her body really well. Shira couldn’t even see her but her eyes peered through the slight gap on layers of the bedsheet.</p>\n<p>She said, “My mother told me to go outside to do my daily errands--but I don’t feel like doing it. I’ll stay here chilling to waste my free time.”</p>\n<p>“No, I’m talking about why you’re covering yourself like this. I really thought you were dirty laundry just now.”</p>\n<p>“I’ll have you know! I’ll have you know, aisshhh! It’s Elder Fhantir! He confiscated the cosmetic Grandpa Piss gave me! He’s going to sell it to Elzhier Family!” Mila hissed with a voice full of seething anger. Maybe if Elder Fhantir wasn’t her senior and one who was regarded as pseudo Grand Elder of Yashura Family, Mila would pull her sleeves and came to fight him to death to in order protect her cosmetic.</p>\n<p>Shira, on the other hand, had a complicated feeling after hearing that. He couldn’t but asked, “I understand if Elder Fhantir sold the family's property to repair our wall. But did he really take your stuff by force?”</p>\n<p>“Well…” the voice from the blob of bedsheets was dragging, “he did say he would contact Grandpa Piss to send another one next week but… how am I supposed to protect my skin until then?!”</p>\n<p>Turned out the one who was unreasonable was Mila in the first place. Shira felt he wasted his precious twenty seconds for his time sympathizing with this block headed cousin of his.</p>\n<p>“Stop this Mila, you’re making yourself looking like a fool,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>He pulled the bedsheet from Mila, but the girl hissed and struggled.</p>\n<p>“What are you doing? You’re exposing me naked!”</p>\n<p>Shira immediately took his hands off the bedsheet. Grimaced, he asked, “What? You’re not wearing any clothes?”</p>\n<p>“No! I’m not applying my skin care!!”</p>\n<p>He just realized Mila was in that kind of phase where she was worse than when she was on her periods. Throwing his hands off the air, Shira left his cousin on the veranda and continued to enter the house. From his aunt he learned his uncle also on that kind of phase where he’d spend in bed, depressed.</p>\n<p>Madam Yashura sighed, “He always has a soft side like this. Why couldn’t he be more decisive like his brother? Will Yashura Family be okay if our patriarch couldn’t even get himself straight?”</p>\n<p>“Aunt, don’t worry,” Shira said, putting down the glass of soybean milk his aunt gave him, “I can substitute for Uncle Shuro on the family hall breakfast this morning since Elder Fhantir’s going to take over the session anyway. Elder Fhantir needs to officially announce his decision to repair our ruined wall, so people wouldn’t notice much if Uncle Shuro absent.”</p>\n<p>“Would that be alright?”</p>\n<p>“As long as Uncle Shuro is fine on tonight’s council meeting, I can’t see reasons for elders would make things difficult for him,” Shira said, confident that more than half of the elders would find excuses to avoid this morning breakfast in family hall, thus as long as Elder Fhantir spared his uncle, it should be fine not attending the morning assembly.</p>\n<p>And it turned out his guess was correct. When he came to the family hall, even the common family members, upon seeing Elder Fhantir had taken the stage, had the face of pretending to see nothing and immediately sneaked out before they were noticed. This made Shira wonder whether those people really were more afraid of Elder Fhantir than the prospect of having Yashura Family’s authority crumbled away slowly. People wouldn’t notice if Patriarch Shuro was absent this morning--only because most of them were busy hiding in their own home trying to cook up excuses to be absent themselves.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, Yashura Family wasn’t as hopeless as it seemed to be. Amongst the minority of elders and common family members who stayed in the family hall, most of them had put solemn expressions and listened to Elder Fhantir’s announcement, eyes brimming with concern. Amongst these faces were traditionalists and hardliners of which Patriarch Shuro always avoided--because if troubles invited debates, the patriarch had never even once won an argument against these people.</p>\n<p>And so the talk went on for a half hours. After the breakfast session was done in the family hall, Shira came to talk personally with Elder Fhantir, who detached himself to smoke a pipe as soon as he had the chance to do so.</p>\n<p>“Elder Fhantir, please take a look at this,” Shira softly placed a wooden box in front of Elder Fhantir.</p>\n<p>“A box?”</p>\n<p>“My private stash,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>This was his secret box he had since he was a child, the only one who knew it existed only people who lived in his house--himself, and his father Jhuro, who never stayed home.</p>\n<p>Elder Fhantir opened the box, then closed it again after he took a brief peek. This made Shira’s smile turned wry. He expected Elder Fhantir would grill him half to death over the content of the box, but got speechless by Elder Fhantir’s lack of reaction.</p>\n<p>“What?” Elder Fhantir grunted. “You want me to nag over the reason why you have so much precious stuff on you? I already know you are hiding your wealth even though you haven’t yet going through your coming of age ceremony.”</p>\n<p>Shira was silent. Exhaling lines of smoke through his nostril, Elder Fhantir continued again, “I’m not blind. I knew what you were up to something since months ago. Previously, I don’t know why you have so much money to befriend an outsider peddler to work for you. But after all those Nalaqs nonsense happened, I reckoned there no need to ask you now.”</p>\n<p>Boys and girls of southern lands were expected to focus only doing daily errands for their parents until the day they were treated as adults on their coming of age ceremony. If the elder willing to let it go the matter of him breaking rules, then surely Shira wouldn’t complain. “Please be free to use it as you see fit. To leave a leeway for our family’s next month Ngajen Ceremony is all I’m asking you.”</p>\n<p>“Hoo, you’re trying to negotiate--I thought you saw the errors of your way and came to ask for forgiveness because I’m scary.”</p>\n<p>“Elder Fhantir, that’s basically my entire saving I had on me currently,” Shira said with a helpless smile. He didn’t expect the old elder to tease him.</p>\n<p>A young man shouldn’t be too impudent and Shira certainly knew his line. Elder Fhantir’s face was apathetic, yet his eyes still clear enough to see sincerity in the boy’s face. He knew that this young master of his was negotiating not for himself, but for his uncle who was devastated in his own bedroom.</p>\n<p>“Very well,” Elder Fhantir dropped his smoking pipe. “Tell that uncle of yours I will leave only one cattle for him to slaughter in the next Ngajen Ceremony. But I will still sell the Wagyu breed that fool uncle of yours always talked to. I can’t give him that cow, it’s the reason why Elzhier Family is willing to buy our cattles in the first place.”</p>\n<p>Ah, in the end, Shira couldn’t save his uncle’s Beefy from being sold by Elder Fhantir. Poor Uncle Shuro--Shira wanted to help him but Elder Fhantir was just too strong.</p>\n<p>It was just sad. But what was more sad for him that the fact before he entered the family hall, Shira was the richest kid in the younger generation of the entire Badril Village--stepping out of the family hall he was dead broke. Shira originally wanted to save a few for his pocket money before Monkey and Snake come back bringing the fruits of his investment, but he didn’t out of guilty conscience. Not to mention Elder Fhantir’s glare giving him an incredible emotional pressure--now he somehow knew why people avoid Elder Fhantir as if their lives were on the line.</p>\n<p>“I did hope everything’s going to be fine next month,” Shira said to himself. If Yashura Family still a mess the time Monkey brought him money, then he wouldn’t be able to sleep at night if he didn’t face Elder Fhantir for the second time.</p>\n<p>After having a breakfast Shira circled around the yard and checked the street where Good-Natured Spirit always hung out smoking cigarettes, wanting to earn some money out of him. Shira didn’t find the Nalaq, though, even after searching on the hill behind Yashura Family still he couldn’t see the annoying cocky smirk that always greeted him with half-harmless verbal abuse.</p>\n<p>Shira then went down to visit his uncle’s home, wanting to find an errand that could generate him some money. He just realized as he itchily rubbed his nose that the prospect of holding no wealth made him very restless. He was restless enough to the point he’d go scraping for pennies. There got to be something he could do to earn Kobe coins.</p>\n<p>“Why don’t you open your own food stall?” his aunt told him when he asked for some work. While generally working and opening business before coming of age ceremony was looked down upon, but most boys and girls still able to earn pocket money by taking advantage of the running errands for their parents. “Your uncle made quite a lot of fortune when he was young by opening his own food stall, you know. Aunt originally preparing Bulayak Satay for launch, there’s a whole pot of Bulayak Satay sauce back in the room. You go ask the kitchen for leftover chicken innards, then you can use Aunt’s Bulayak sauce and sell satays at the mountain’s foot.”</p>\n<p>That was actually a good idea. If his guardian was the one who took an initiative to send him on an errand where he could gather some money the old people--even hardliners like Elder Fhantir--they wouldn’t be able to question him of breaking the rules out loud. Amongst the three members of Patriarch Shuro’s family, Shira always knew his aunt was the most reliable of them.</p>\n<p>The young masters of big families usually had many ways of getting money secretly through connection. Some privileged young masters like Shira, had people like his aunt and Butler Yulong he always relied on. Eventually, also with Butler Yulong who made things smooth behind the scenes, Shira set off from Yashura Family pushing a portable stall in form of a cart, with the destination of Badril Mountain’s entrance--commonly known as the border between the village and mountain full of monsters--a place where hunters and teenagers who wanted to raise their levels by fighting monsters usually hung around in search of team party or preparing for their adventures.</p>\n<p>He began grilling Bulayak Satay as soon as he unloaded his cart and his food stall assembled at the place reversed for Yashura Family’s people. Before his satays get done not many people interested in his shop. However, as the smokes from his grilling satays spread across the place, some older people then came to him with their faces sullen as if Shira did them wrong.</p>\n<p>“Isn’t it too soon for you to set up your business, Young Master Shira?” an old hunter said to him.</p>\n<p>Another one said, “Our kids are following our ancestors' rules not to be too mindful about money before their coming of age ceremony, Young Master Shira. You came from Yashura Family, I know; but if you break customs so blatantly, wouldn’t that be a bad example for other kids of other families, no?”</p>\n<p>These people were from common origin, but their tones were particularly harsh seeing Shira trying to earn money for himself. Southern Mossack culture didn’t lack a caste system, albeit vague and hadn’t had the inequality class struggles problems like more sophisticated society of the western empires and the easterns kingdoms did. Poor and rich were commonly seen dining together at the same table during ceremonies. Peasants and masters were usually laughing and farming together under the scorching sun. And because of that, it was understandable for random folks berating young masters if they were crossing the line.</p>\n<p>Though unfamiliar to the experience, Shira knew this. Thus he previously prepared an excuse so people would leave him earning money in peace.</p>\n<p>“I’m opening my stall under my uncle’s order,” Shira lied with a straight face. “My Yashura Family recently got in trouble financially in case you don’t know. So my uncle told me to get some money for disaster relief fund. Try this, this is the famous Shuro Yashura’s secret Bulayak Satay recipe.”</p>\n<p>They didn’t believe Shira at first. But upon tasting the Bulayak Satay themselves, these complainer relished themselves in the deliciousness of the satays.</p>\n<p>“Ah, it really is Patriarch Shuro’s Bulayak Satay! I’d be damned!”</p>\n<p>“How long was the last time I eaten satays from Patriarch Shuro’s food stall?” the other one lamented the fact that with no social status, eating food that was personally cooked by Patriarch of Yashura Family was only a dream. “I can’t believe you can replicate the same taste of Patriarch Shuro’s Bulayak Satay, Young Master Shira. I thought it could only be done only if you share the same kitchen with Patriarch Shuro at least for twenty years! To think you have this kind of talent, you’d be a great Patriarch Yashura in the future!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, of course,” Shira humbly nodded at the sudden sung of praise given to him. He knew his uncle’s name alone could make his food stall best seller in the village if he wanted to, thus he unashamedly took credit over the Bulayak Satay’s sauce that his aunt had prepared for him beforehand. “Do you like it, dear customers?”</p>\n<p>“It’s Patriarch Shuro’s secret Bulayak Satay recipe. What’s not to like?” one man said with a friendly smile.</p>\n<p>Shira also began to smile friendly, “Thank you. That would be thirty five Kobe copper coins.”</p>\n<p>And abruptly the original friendly smile froze flastergabbedly.</p>\n<p>“What?! Thirty five?” one man slapped his thigh in anger. “Patriarch Shuro only sold his Bulayak Satay for five copper coins back in the day!”</p>\n<p>“Ah, that was more twenty years ago. Dear kind uncles, have you read something called inflation? Should I enlighten you with a lecture on basic economy theory?”</p>\n<p>The complainers learned this Yashura Family’s young master was actually hard to deal with. They left unhappy after paying for the Bulayak Satay they had eaten.</p>\n<p>After that, with the help of his uncle’s reputation as one of the best cook in Badril Village, Shira didn’t encounter any difficulty selling his Bulayak Satay anymore. People came, at times even forming a line, which was rare for other food stalls. The amount of money flowing in made his smile become more slick and natural as the time went by. Indeed, as they said, even rice could taste as sweet as sugar cane if earned with the good ol’ honest hard work--although in Shira’s case, half-honest half-hard work, since he should credit his aunt for preparing the Bulayak Satay.</p>\n<p>“Business is good, good good good.” A voice intrusively came from his side when Shira’s thought entrapped by the coins he was counting. Shira raised his head--not surprisingly, Good-Natured Spirit came uninvited as always.</p>\n<p>“Ah, where were you before, I was searching for you everywhere.”</p>\n<p>“Kid, adult got stuff they have to deal with,” Good-Natured Spirit replied as he bent with a cigarette on his lips, lighting it with the flame made by fresh charcoal that Shira had just thrown it. “What do you searching me for anyway?”</p>\n<p>“Well, I sought you to play chess. But I’ve got stuff to do deal with so I currently can’t humor a <em>busy</em> adult like you. Maybe later before evening. I’m free around that time.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit chuckled, too lazy to counter the boy’s sarcasm. “Alright, man, call me anytime whenever you ready to lost your soul.”</p>\n<p>Shira had never worried about how he’d win the game against Good-Natured Spirit--the bet he’d extort him was the place he needed to get creative, instead.</p>\n<p>“Why the fuck you Yashuras always made your charcoal from goddamn coconut shells?” Good-Natured Spirit groaned as he had difficulty lighting his cigarette.</p>\n<p>“Don’t ask me. We’ve been overwhelmed by coconut ever since my uncle took the position of the family’s head,” Shira said. Even this Bulayak Satay, unlike any other satays specialized in other families, used coconut milk and red spices as the base for its sauce instead of the earthy, creamy peanut sauce Mossacks’ satays always known for. There was a reason why Patriarch Shuro had the best Bulayak Satay recipe, but sucked at making other kinds of satays.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t even two hours since he opened his food stall. The amount of customers Shira had dwindled after people began climbing the mountain to either hunt for monsters or training their levels. With the outrageous amount of revenue he got after exploiting his uncle’s name, surely his aunt wouldn’t complain if he ate one or two portions of Bulayak Satay for himself. And thus under the carefree sun Shira had his leg crossed lazily, eating grilled chicken innard satays with the spicy but mild Bulayak Satay sauce, Shira talked some useless stuff with Good-Natured Spirit who was smoking beside him to pass time.</p>\n<p>“You should stop talking to yourself. You’re making me ashamed for having you as my fiancé.”</p>\n<p>The one who was talking before him was the Young Lady of Malikh Family, Bhela Malikh. She came with archery gears, complete with half-breast armor for female archers used to not having her things got in the way of her drawing arrows, and the famous icy face that wasn’t smiling; anyone could guess she didn’t come here to say hello to her fiancé. She came purely because she overheard Patriarch Shuro’s Bulayak Satay was being sold once again.</p>\n<p>Shira thought it was his bad luck, the first day he opened his food stall he met someone he’d rather not meet the most. Especially when the bastard Good-Natured Spirit was around only to laugh at him.</p>\n<p>“Two portion Bulayak Satay, put it in one plate,” Bhela said in business-like manner.</p>\n<p>“Do you want to eat here or wrap it home?” he asked.</p>\n<p>Bhela didn’t immediately answer, she glanced at the stack of clay plates stacked for consumers who wanted to eat on the spot. “How much would you sell for one clay plate you have?”</p>\n<p>“This is not a wareshop,” Shira remarked.</p>\n<p>One glance was enough to tell she wasn’t happy. She said coldly, “I have a friend. We’re planning to eat here. But I don’t want her to meet you.”</p>\n<p>“Hah hah, sure you don’t. Though I would appreciate it if you didn’t say it aloud. Here, I’ll give you one plate you can bring home for fifty Kobe copper coins.” Just get the hell out of here--Shira’s sour tone implied.</p>\n<p>For the first time Shira was grateful that Good-Natured Spirit--who had been rolling on the floor from his hysterical laughing--to not revealing himself to the common eyes. And he also felt lucky for having a face thick enough to maintain his poker face as he wordlessly prepared Bulayak Satay for Bhela to take out.</p>\n<p>Just as Shira was about to complete the order, Bhela said something to him, “Just so that you know, Young Master Blackwood is a certified Level 13 Knight class who studied under a veteran of the royal knight army. Compared to that, your Level 3 Novice status isn’t worth mentioning.”</p>\n<p>Giving the Bulayak Satay Bhela ordered, Shira said, “It’s very nice of you to be concerned for your <em>real</em> fiancé. But please don’t have to worry, I have my own plan.”</p>\n<p>Bhela frowned.</p>\n<p>“Making a contract with an evil Nalaq isn’t a smart plan,” she said flatly, and said nothing afterward. The girl turned around and leave immediately as soon as she paid for the Bulayak Satay.</p>\n<p>Shira sighed. Everyone always said that he was the luckiest boy in Badril Village to be promised the village’s most beautiful and talented Bhela Malikh--yet, in his honest opinion, his noisy cousin Mila Yashura was cuter than this proud peacock who always had the expression seeing everyone else was beneath her. A fiancée who looked down on him on the front, and envious young men from behind, truly--Shira lamented--if he wasn’t the unluckiest boy in Badril Village, what was he then?</p>\n<p>“Kid, your girl is pretty hot, alright, but I think there’s something wrong in her head,” Good-Natured Spirit said solemnly as he patted his ethereal clothes from invisible dusts. “How come a handsome me could be evil?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, yes, you’re not downright evil.” Shira nodded. “Lecher, maybe, but not every degenerate are plain evil like their haters believe.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit looked at him with eyes narrowed. He recalled the first time he revealed himself in front of Shira, the boy was alert and conscious of his own words and actions. Yet, some months later, and many games of chess later, this kid got cocky and never really put him in his eyes.</p>\n<p>“You know,” Good-Natured Spirit after a click of tongue, “that Bimbo Nalaq was worshipped by her girl and their relationship is pretty healthy. I’m not asking you to worship me, but at least you Mossack people should respect a Nalaq, no?”</p>\n<p>“I recall you said you’re not a Nalaq some time ago. One thing about respect, Ol’ Good-Natured Spirit, it is something earned--so maybe if you don’t make troubles all around the place I’ll kneel in front of you.”</p>\n<p>“When was I making trouble? The fuck did I do?” asked the guy who been mocking him and laughing out loud before. Talking with Good-Natured Spirit somehow made Shira’s mood even worsen. “And who the hell gives you permission to talk some fancy shit?”</p>\n<p>“I’m not the one who’s saying it. It’s Yulong.”</p>\n<p>“Yulong, eh?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, Yulong--why you’re having that kind of face whenever it’s about Yulong?” Shira asked.</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit sneered between smoking his cigarette. “No meaning, I just find the old prick’s too pretentious. It’s annoying.”</p>\n<p>“You should stop. Yulong is a good man.”</p>\n<p>“Oohhh… really?” the nalaq sneered.</p>\n<p>“Well, at least he’s sophisticated,” Shira said, then, with a low voice, he inquired, “Yulong somehow knew about the sect in Elzhier Family. He’s someone reliable, don’t you think.”</p>\n<p>“Heeh, I wouldn’t know,” Good-Natured Spirit acted as if he didn’t care. But Shira caught his eyes winced a little.</p>\n<p>The boy didn’t say anything excessive after that. For the leecher Nalaq to hold himself back from making misogynist jokes when there were chances, he knew Good-Natured Spirit had a thought on his own. Shira, too, pretended to know nothing and continued selling Bulayak Satay liked he did before. It was because of Yulong’s name. The Nalaq’s sudden alertness made him able to confirm that he was able to safely extort Good-Natured Spirit so many times without getting retaliated--because Yulong, from behind, was watching over him.</p>\n<p>“Your girl, anyhow, feels that it's beneath her to get engaged with Novice trash like you,” Good-Natured Spirit suddenly said with an out-of-tune voice that was unusual to him, “why don’t you prove her wrong, eh? I still got Training of Hell for you to get stronk fast, remember? The offer still stand. You’ll be crowded with chicks if you follow my way.”</p>\n<p>They had discussed this before, so Shira replied with the same answer. “No,” he said, “I have my own plan for this. Even if Yashura Family doesn’t get lucky with Sir Staterwind’s offer, there’s no need for me to sweat blood and tears just so that girl can have her own satisfaction.”</p>\n<p>Shira might be not able to beat the noble young master from that Blackwood Family. He didn’t have to. When no one expected him to win the only thing he should avoid was to drag Yashura Family’s face down the mud--as long as he able to lose with grace, anything else fine.</p>\n<p>“Where are you going?” Shira asked when he saw Good-Natured Spirit arose from his sitting.</p>\n<p>“I’m gonna familiar myself with some chicks.”</p>\n<p>Shira didn’t want to see the Nalaq when he out harassing girls with his invisibility. So he didn’t make him stay.</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit floated away as if he did the usual business and looked for some eye candies. But the moment he got out of the Shira’s line of sight, he appeared again, somewhat hidden in the crowd, crossing his arms with cigarettes between fingers he watched the boy carefully, eyes narrowed sharp.</p>\n<p>It had been months the Nalaq realized he couldn’t beat the boy with only game of chess. He realized, as the time went by, Shira became cocky in front of him, and more so in the past few weeks. And now that the kid realized he got some backers watching over him, Good-Natured Spirit thought he would become even more cocky, and he didn’t welcome that quite nicely.</p>\n<p>“Heehh,” he snorted. He turned back and floated away as Shira suddenly became busy with the second wave of customers.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>One thing that made Bulayak Satay stood out was its use of coconut. Bulayak Satay wasn’t the only satay recipe that used coconut milk as its base for the sauce, but it certainly widely known for wrapping Lontong with coconut leaves. Lontong was rice steamed in wrapping, was plain but filling. A famous travelling consineur once called it “solid boring porridge”, which was a praise for staple grain to support the rich taste of spicy dishes that Mossack cuisines known for. In any other satay dishes, however, Lontong always synonymed by color green, since it was commonly made by putting washed rice on green banana leaves and left it cook under steam heat.</p>\n<p>Reason for why Bulayak Satay different; the coconut leaves first weaved into a cone or long tube before filled with rice, resulting in the same but quite different Lontong that people normally eat on any other dishes. Granted, Bulayak Satay maybe wasn’t the only one dish that use coconut leaves wrapped Lontong, but a certain patriarch/coconut scholar would argue that if served with ordinary banana leaves Lontong, then Bulayak Satay would be nothing but ordinary satay with spicy coconut milk sauce. This patriarch/coconut scholar happened to be the best Bulayak Satay maker in the whole Badril Village, so his words were pretty big deal back when he said that. This was why in Badril Village Bulayak Satay was synonymous of coconut leaves Lontong.</p>\n<p>The one who explained this was a maidservant of Elzhier Family named Nilda Elzhier. Lyla seemed to be listening while she dipped the long Lontong with spicy coconut milk sauce, mostly because Nilda also taught her the way to enjoy Bulayak Satay properly, which in Lyla’s experience, quite novel and enjoyable compared to peanut sauce satays Bhela always gave her.</p>\n<p>“I like this Bulayak Satay! Why don’t aunties in the kitchen never make Bulayak Satay, Sis Bhela?”</p>\n<p>“Because Yashura Family makes the best Bulayak Satay, though they don’t sell it very often,” Bhela said, recalling the last time she had eaten Patriarch Shuro’s Bulayak Satay was when she was seven.</p>\n<p>Today, thing Lyla liked the most about Bulayak Satay--aside the taste--was the joy when she unwrapped the coconut leaves Lontong. Nilda taught her to open on one end, then let the gravity unwhirled it opened partially so that she could eat it while holding the wrapped side. With that, there was no need to use spoon or fork to enjoy Bulayak Satay.</p>\n<p>“Whoever thought of this is a genius!” Lyla exclaimed as she bit the dipped Lontong.</p>\n<p>“Mm,” Bhela hummed, took a bit of one satay. Her face might not look like it, but she was happy seeing that Lyla had a very healthy appetite.</p>\n<p>The three of them were squatting behind a shop owned by Malikh Family, hiding from the public sight. After all, although Lyla had disguised herself with common clothes, there always chances that people might wonder the origin of a girl they didn’t know. They didn’t want that. Even though the Elzhier Family’s side promised Bhela to obstruct Butler Tim and Elder Jhamil’s faction from finding her and Lyla.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Nilda the maidservant was watching the two of them from the side. Originally, Bhela ordered Bulayak Satay for two people, and Nilda thought the two girls would share the food like sisters. It was true they shared the Bulayak Satay, but Bhela seemed to touch no more than three satays, while the rest were wolved down by the glutton Lyla.</p>\n<p>“Is it fine to let Young Lady Lyla eat all the food? Isn’t you have big meal when having breakfast before?” Nilda asked, concerned by the pure glutton by the name of Lyla Blackwood.</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at the maidservant, replied straightforwardly, “It is fine.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, it’s fine!” Lyla howled. “Back in my home they always give me a small plate of meat while call it high-end cuisine! What high-end cuisine? If it can’t fill my belly then it’s not worth being called cuisine! Bulayak Satay is the real high-end cuisine--Badril Village food is the best!”</p>\n<p>“You sure are very happy visiting Badril Village, Young Lady Lyla,” Nilda said with a smile.</p>\n<p>One striking trait that Nilda had noticed when watching Lyla ate was that the Blackwood girl’s skin was bright and healthy, seemingly nourished by a very expensive tonic. Nilda also noticed Bhela’s skin became more beautiful than the last time she saw her, but it was nowhere near Lyla’s that would make even the prettiest girl envious.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela, are you using cosmetics given by Medicine King to Young Lady Lyla?”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at Lyla’s bright and healthy skin. “Yes. Nobles like Blackwood Family loved to use mercury powder to whiten their skin, so previously she wasn’t always like this. It’s very fortunate the cosmetic gifted to me can revitalize her malnourished skin.”</p>\n<p>“How envious of you two can maintain your beauty with Medicine King’s cosmetic,” Nilda the maidservant lamented. “I heard Yashura Family sold their Eldest Young Lady’s cosmetics this morning, but Aunty Niu Elang sent those cosmetics back to the sect for disciples to compete for. I heard the girls in my sect all going crazy fighting for them.”</p>\n<p>Bhela blinked upon hearing the maidservant mentioned the sect. All she knew about the faraway sect where her friend Ryntia Elzhier studied was that it was well-connected, resourceful, and was boldly an all-girl sect in the midst of patriarchal society. Not much beyond that her knowledge about the place. But today she learned, apparently, it was the kind of sect where its disciples fight each other over some cosmetics.</p>\n<p>“Is Sister Ryntia alright there? I have used the cosmetics only once both for me and Lyla--if Sister Ryntia wants it, I can send mine since we don’t really put attention to this kind of things, anyway.”</p>\n<p>“You don’t have to, Young Lady Bhela. If our Eldest Young Lady really eyed the cosmetics then there wouldn’t be any competition in the first place.”</p>\n<p>Bhela insisted, “Why don’t you do me a favor and inform her later whether she has a friend who also wants that cosmetic. Just count this as my thanks for the helps during my time in the seminars and for bringing croissants the other day.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, croissant!” Lyla quipped. “Let’s barter that cosmetic with croissants instead! One cosmetic, with croissants this many!” she said while holding a bamboo basket almost twice the size of her belly. Barter cosmetic made by the famous Medicine King and a basketful of pastries; her face was unusually solemn as if she just presented a very good deal, honestly believe a cosmetic that sought by many nobles and royals, worth pastries that could only fill her belly for one day.</p>\n<p>Conversation got cut off when Nilda felt at loss seeing her serious expression. The girl indeed was too easy to get excited. There was no use explaining things to Lyla if she didn’t get it. A pat on the head was all Bhela did to calm the excited Lyla. And eventually, the supposed noble Blackwood young lady lost interest and began on chugging fresh coconut that prepared for her beforehand, then for some reason she broke into a dance and began to sing, completely forgetting about her outrageous deal. It just how Lyla was being Lyla.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Originally, Lyla and Bhela spent some times eating Bulayak Satay not just to hang around. They planned to climb the mountain after all.</p>\n<p>But Badril Village mountain was known to be hostile filled with beast and monsters--and in the more scarier, deeper place, roamed by the feared Selaqs. Some places were relatively safe but it was already a norm for those who wanted to climb to form a party first, adventuring and leveling together while they were at it. Unfortunately, the only sect members in Elzhier Family Bhela could borrow was this lass named Nilda. Therefore, she had to invite some more reliable youngsters to accompany her to hunt games on the mountain.</p>\n<p>The problem was if she sought people without others’ help she’d only attract boys that wanted to hit her. It was fine if they only annoyed her; Bhela could just send them off with a cold glare, they wouldn’t dare to bother her the second time. But Lyla was different. Bhela didn’t want some flies getting close especially when Lyla had her head-in-the-cloud moment.</p>\n<p>“Where’s your young master, really? Setting off when the sun is hanging high is undesirable,” Bhela said to Nilda.</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry for the inconvenience, Young Lady Bhela. Unless it was Eldest Young Lady, we don’t have much voice in voicing influence in the main family--especially for Young Master Bonithon Elzhier. If it’s alright with you I will go to see whether my young master is ready with his friends.”</p>\n<p>“Then you’ll be inconvenienced by me, many thanks.”</p>\n<p>Because of the treatments she always got whether in the village or overseas, Bhela hadn’t trusted boys. But toward Bony Elzhier it was different. Not because she trusted his personality, but because she heard some secrets from his elder sister, Ryntia Elzhier who studied on a sect overseas, a secret good enough to put him in his place. She trusted this secret that the well-known delinquent Young Master of Elzhier Family wouldn’t want to hit on her or Lyla--the problem was two of his lackeys, however.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” Pilek, one of Bony’s lackeys, approached with grinning face, “I heard Malikh Family is hosting a very noble foreign young lady. Would it be possible to introduce me to her, eh? Eh?”</p>\n<p>“What?”</p>\n<p>It wasn’t Bhela who responded, but a girl who was squatting beneath a tree, who chewing on raw grass. Whenever Bhela wasn’t looking Lyla always been naughty, it just so happened that she was curious whether Paku Grass would become sweet if she chewed it long enough, just like Aunty Yaya told her.</p>\n<p>Pilek gloated. Anyone who was idiot enough to imitate goats chewing on wild grass surely wasn’t anybody important. So her ignored the grass-chewing girl and continued on pestering Bhela, saying, “Please introduce me to Young Lady Blackwood! I’ll owe you a lot!”</p>\n<p>Bhela just looked at him coldly with her mouth shut. It was Lyla again who jumped and snarled, “Who are you?”</p>\n<p>Against a strange girl with such a rude and grassy mouth, Pilek lost his patience and rolled his eyes. “And who are you? What are you doing eating grass anyway?”</p>\n<p>“Paku Grass is edible! Granny Litha said so!”</p>\n<p>Before Pilek could even scoff her stupidity, Bony came to slap his head from behind. It seemed Bony was sensible enough to realize the real identity of the weird girl.</p>\n<p>“This is Lyla, my cousin,” Bhela introduced only after Lyla felt happy seeing Pilek’s wronged face, while her fingers busily forcing Lyla to spit out grass the naughty girl just ate.</p>\n<p>Bony said, “I received some coins from Elder Shyla and tasked to accompany you adventuring the mountain.”</p>\n<p>“I just want you to guard Lyla. Don’t bother with me, I can carry around myself.”</p>\n<p>Bony shrugged. He got paid and the client had the right to tell him what to do. Thus, after telling his lackeys to check on their equipment, he told them their task, “You two guard Bhela’s cousin closely. I’ll be at the tail.”</p>\n<p>“You’re guarding the back, boss?” Polio asked. “And with Bhela at the front, what danger should we’re guarding her from?”</p>\n<p>“Maybe we should keep an eye on her so that she doesn’t eat any other weird things, like grass, for instance.” Pilek from the side chuckled.</p>\n<p>Bony slapped the back of his head again. Pilek almost cried felt wronged because he didn’t know what he did wrong.</p>\n<p>“Just keep an eye on that girl, don’t say anything unnecessary,” Bony said solemnly. “And also--don’t argue with her. Just don’t.”</p>\n<p>Bhela saw the boys discussing their things through, then turned to Nilda to ask, “Does your young master know about your sect?”</p>\n<p>Nilda shook her head. “Aunty Niu Elang decided not to involve too much of the family into sect matters.”</p>\n<p>“Then he shouldn’t be informed about Lyla’s identity.”</p>\n<p>“Well, young lady, anyone could guess when Elder Jhamil sent their men all around the village to search for her,” Nilda said with a smile, lightly hinted with her eyes to the girl who was sneakily looking for something she could chew.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Later on, they climbed Badril Mountain with a party of six people. Bhela as the Archer and the scout was at the very front, traversing the moldy stone stairs of the mountain, picking routes based on her memories two years before she attended the oversea seminars.</p>\n<p>Bony committed as the most senior and a Knight class fighter with the highest level to guard the party’s back, resting a big machete on his broad shoulder, wearing no armor beside coarse clothes he wore this morning. From the talks of the peddlers and travelers, those southern fighters with Knight class were more crude and practical than their westerner peers--the westerners which were always gallant, always speaking about honors, always clad in steel armor and always had their own insignia embedded on their shield. Their southern peers instead were simple. They were known by their brute prowess not by their elite romanticism, totally not being cheap like some western Knights used to mock them.</p>\n<p>Speaking of being cheap, there was Pilek. He was a Pugilist so his weapon mostly a spiked gauntlet he bought for a few copper coins from the blacksmith uncle who lived next door--quite unexpectedly, Pugilist that usually wasn’t that popular in the job market outside the village, was quite abundant here, especially when youngsters’ thugs battle were popular, thus many created gauntlets for them resulting those simple weapons’ price dropped very cheap.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Polio the other Bony’s lackey was a traditional Mage who brought an old wooden staff he inherited from his father, who long retired casting spell in favor of stable life farming and fulfilling duty as the elder of a minor family in the village. The usually quiet deliquent looked like a proper mage when he equipped the old staff. Nilda, who looked even more humble in her maidservant attire, brought with her a simple-looking dagger she put in her belt--of which, secretly, was something she got from her predecessor and being imbued by high-level magic by her sect’s Artificer, a knife that being too modest of an appearance if throats cutted and blood spilt were being counted.</p>\n<p>And finally, there was Lyla. Lyla brought a bamboo basket. A fine crafted bamboo basket, but an ordinary bamboo basket nonetheless.</p>\n<p>“Get me some berries to feed bunnies and kitties~~ yuuhuuu~ feeding lovely bunnies and kitties~~~”</p>\n<p>“Really, what is this girl really doing here?” Pilek uttered as he watched, while others were occupied with monsters and mountain beasts, Lyla was busy foraging the mountain, humming on some carefree song about bunnies and kitties. The previous empty basket was now filled with mushroom and berries. She didn’t even seemed to be interested in leveling up her stats.</p>\n<p>“Don’t say anything unnecessary, remember,” Polio reminded.</p>\n<p>And thus, they continued adventuring the mountain with such light and hearty atmosphere with Lyla’s bunny and kitty song playing in the background.</p>\n<p>Five minutes ago, Bhela spotted a fleeing pheasant. She sprang alone with her bow in order to hunt it down. Bony, the leader of the boys, went on a different path to investigate the mountain since the air about it was quite different than the usual.</p>\n<p>“Still, we’re climbing up to hunt some wild goats but haven’t found any for a few hours,” Pilek complained after gulping fresh water from his bamboo container.</p>\n<p>Polio said after a thought, “Mountain goats are adept and sensitive to dangers. So maybe it’s not safe today, after all.”</p>\n<p>“Huusshh! That girl is maybe listening!” Pilek whispered, glancing at Lyla and the maidservant Nilda who both were sat on grassy ground to eat some mountain fruits they had gathered. Pilek continued, “What if they decided to annul our job and don’t pay us?”</p>\n<p>Polio looked at him. “Well, it depends on what Boss Bony has to say. If he’s saying it’s dangerous and we need to return back to the village, then we’re going down no matter what. If you want to keep your money then it’s our boss’s mood that you should’ve worried about.”</p>\n<p>Bony came back and sat down with Pilek and Polio, wiping sweat on his forehead with the bottom of his shirt the first thing he did.</p>\n<p>“How is it, boss?” Pilek asked.</p>\n<p>Bony took a big gulp of fresh water before he replied.</p>\n<p>“I’ve been circling around the mountain. I found nothing.”</p>\n<p>“Nothing? That’s good. I really thought we won’t get paid today.”</p>\n<p>“No,” Bony cut off Pilek’s sense of relief, said with an urgent tone, “it is really nothing. Except the beasts we’ve met before, I found no other beasts prowling around the mountain.”</p>\n<p>“Is it bad?”</p>\n<p>“It is bad.”</p>\n<p>Bony spat his phlegm.</p>\n<p>“We should go down. But let’s hear what that Malikh girl’s going to say first,” he said as he peered through the distance, seeing a young female silhouette hopping around on slippery steps with a pheasant carcass in her hands.</p>\n<p>“Sis Bhela, did you find the wild mountain goats?” Lyla shouted as soon as Bhela returned.</p>\n<p>“Yes, but they hide behind a path guarded by a big anaconda.”</p>\n<p>Lyla gasped. A big anaconda was a big deal. Its belly was so big it can fit an adult person in it. Its presence gave a big warning thus Lyla asked worriedly, “Does that mean we won’t get to make goat satays tonight?”</p>\n<p>Bhela patted her head. “Don’t worry. Tonight we’ll be grilling wild goat satays with Aunty Yaya and others.”</p>\n<p>She had promised Lyla, and she didn’t plan to retract it back. So she approached Bony and others again to make a deal.</p>\n<p>“You guys can have the anaconda. I just want a single wild goat,” Bhela said to them.</p>\n<p>“That big anaconda you mean? The one that everyone was talking about last year? Are you crazy?” Pilek realized his tongue slipped and quickly corrected his tune. “Dear kind Young Lady Bhela, it’s not that we don’t want to help you. But against a Level 18 Anaconda, even with Boss Bony here we won’t make the cut!”</p>\n<p>“You are wrong,” Bhela said flatly, “it’s Level 19.”</p>\n<p>“That is even worse!”</p>\n<p>Bhela wanted to discuss this to someone with more intellect, so she turned to Bony. “I haven’t seen any other beast that strong enough to threaten our party except for that big anaconda. There wouldn’t be any distractions. So hunting it down should be easy.”</p>\n<p>“And you’re saying you don’t find anything wrong with not seeing any other beast except that anaconda?”</p>\n<p>Bhela was quiet for a moment. Back when she hunted the fleeing pheasant, a masked woman came to her to tell that she ought to be careful not to approach the peak of Badril Mountain. A disturbance happened this morning; the watchers witnessed the beasts and wild animals fleeing down the mountain. Seeing the mountain dwellers running for their lives like that only meant one bad thing--Selaq.</p>\n<p>Because Bhela had received help from women with similar masks in the past, Bhela did put the warning in her heart. “They are fleeing because Selaqs become more active than usual,” she said to Bony. “We should be fine as long as we return back before the sun sets.”</p>\n<p>Bony looked hesitant, thus Bhela added, “Young Master Elzhier, I just want to let you know that I have other mean to bring that anaconda down. I came to you purely because I’ve received many favor from your elder sister. You must be at the tip of your level progress, so killing this anaconda should give you an opportunity to advance to the next level.”</p>\n<p>Polio, with a sharp tone, asked her, “And how would you hunt down an anaconda that can eat people with a single maw, young lady?”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at him. Her gaze wasn’t exactly friendly as she replied, “Don’t get eaten.”</p>\n<p>She turned around and returned to Lyla and Nilda. Just like her trademark expression, Bhela’s respond was cold, seemed to particularly not care about how they should take down the dangerous slithering creature that set them apart with the wild goats that Lyla wanted to grill as satays very much.</p>\n<p>Pilek punched a floating leaves with his knuckle indignantly, spat, “She’s talking like that only because she’s in the back with her damn bow!”</p>\n<p>A few days ago, Pilek was one of those villagers who was proud of Bhela Malikh for her talent and capability of being selected to oversea seminars. But the more he talked with her the more he recalled how unlikable this lass originally was. Somehow Pilek felt deceived by her fame and her pretty face.</p>\n<p>Polio once again proceeded to ask the boss, Bony, “Now what do we do, boss?”</p>\n<p>Bony was originally crossing his arms, fell to his own thought. Looking at his two lackeys, he whispered, “The last thing I want things to happen is to refund their money. That girl has Elder Shyla backing her somehow.”</p>\n<p>Even Pilek who had his blood boiled in anger closed his mouth shut suddenly. His boss the Young Master of Elzhier Family--although of being a good-for-nothing delinquent like everybody said--was sharp, and aware of things normally people wouldn’t be aware of. Despite being the heir himself, Bony knew who he shouldn’t offend inside Elzhier Family. And naturally Pilek and Polio who followed him for years would also heard the normally friendly and sexy Elder Shyla wasn’t someone to be reckoned with.</p>\n<p>“Anaconda then…” Polio muttered.</p>\n<p>“That girl won’t change her mind no matter how we convince her,” Pilek wryly smiled.</p>\n<p>“Don’t dilly dallying around. Let’s go now,” Bony said as he rested his machete on his shoulder and began to march, even though Bhela hadn’t finished eating berries with Lyla gathered.</p>\n<p>“Please keep Lyla safe,” Bhela said to Nilda as she equipped her quiver once again.</p>\n<p>“Don’t worry, Young Lady Bhela. Some elder sisters of mine are here to give support,” the maidservant said with a slight smile.</p>\n<p>Bhela felt assured knowing that. She then looked at Lyla, patted her head. She said, “Lyla, there’s something I want to tell you.”</p>\n<p>“Hmm, what is it, Sistah?”</p>\n<p>Bhela picked one berry and put it in her mouth.</p>\n<p>“Kittens don’t eat berries,” she said.</p>\n<p>“What?!”</p>\n<p>Lyla was shocked by the sudden revelation. Never would she thought that the cute kitties didn't like sweet berries she had gathered with her own hands. It was unbelievable. But what was even more unbelievable was that, a minute later, Lyla also found out bunnies don’t actually eat mushrooms--truly unbelievable!</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The anaconda Bhela sighted was a beast feared by nearby hunters and young adventurers. Normally, if a dangerous beast appeared within the hunting routes, major families would form a subjugate team to hunt it down. Though this one was different. The problem was this big anaconda originally lived beyond the safe vicinity, so the practical Badril Village Head thought giving people warning would be far more efficient than form a posse--which often usually calling back the village’s fighters that been working outside the village. However, because the disturbance from the top of the mountain, it slithering down to more peaceful place, rendering the lower part of Badril Mountain dangerous because of it.</p>\n<p>Young people were ambitious, especially those with talents like Bhela Malikh and Bony Elzhier. Since they were the ones who found it down here, they’d use this opportunity to hunt the anaconda themselves and leveling up in the process.</p>\n<p>“Take this, you dumb son of a bitch! Hya hya hyaa!” Pilek’s high pitched swearing resounded across the mountain as he unleashed a flurry of infused mana punches--which deal almost no damage to the thick-skinned anaconda five times his size.</p>\n<p>On contrary, it was actually better if Pilek didn’t blindly attacking instead. That what was Bhela thought. She was an Unique Class Archer of which she herself was confident to be able the most damage to her giant opponent, yet, due to Bony and Pilek at the front not knowing the word “holding back”, her arrows were to harass carefully instead of packing them with destructive elemental power. Clicks of tongue the only way she expressed her annoyance whenever her chance of shooting her skill disrupted by two muscleheads at the front.</p>\n<p>Not far away from there, hidden behind the foliage and leaves of tree branch were two silhouettes, watching the unorganized party battling the anaconda. They were women in masks, one with falcon mask and the other with an owl one, both who were under Elder Shyla’s direct command to watch over Bhela and others.</p>\n<p>“Seems like Young Lady Bhela is showing her inexperience in adapting with other party members,” the falcon mask commented.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela wasn’t the type of person who was comfortable shouting around to people, especially boys,” the owl mask said.</p>\n<p>“She should stick around with the Mage boy and let him yell at the two others instead.”</p>\n<p>“Well, I don’t think that boy was the type who likes shouting, either.”</p>\n<p>With no attacks packed with real power dealing enough damage, the anaconda didn’t seem to be cornered by the four party members--almost. It was the work of the three boys that gave a surprising good result instead.</p>\n<p>“Those three’s teamwork is real solid. Young Master Bonithon is a good team leader. I don’t know he have this kind of talent,” the owl mask remarked.</p>\n<p>“Of course he is. He’s the younger brother of Young Lady Ryntia, after all.”</p>\n<p>Bony and his two lackeys attacked neither with fancy skills nor technique but solid pummelling. Only if reading their flow one could tell how good their coordination was. Bony, for example, got the deadliest attack of them all, but his attack style mostly done in short and heavy bursts that leave no chance for his opponent to defend against. But that also meant he didn’t focus on defending against counter-attacks. So this was when Pilek came in.</p>\n<p>Pilek flurry of punches that delivered a little lighter than Bony’s machete swings, but he was steady and able to keep prolonged attacks that if ignored, could deal quite a significant damage. Pilek might’ve looked like he was jumping around like some annoying monkey, managed to avoid fatal attacks every time, but his steady assaults and his nimble agility allowed him to successfully draw the annaconda’s attention by the time Bony’s defence was at its edge. And then, by the time Pilek was short on his breath from avoiding the annacond’s giant jaw, from the back came Polio’s turn to unleash his most powerful skill, which despite many chance to use it previously, he just saved it particularly for this kind of situation.</p>\n<p>The anaconda staggered its head up in the air by the magic force Polio shot. Its sharp eyes locked at the despicable Mage that broke part of its skin. Slithering its giant body forward, it tried to approach Polio instead bothering with the two humans that it had difficulty in dealing with. But Bony, who had recovered his balance, wouldn’t allow it to roam free. He chased from the side, completely disregarding his defense, trying to chop its giant body with his machete. Polio running in circle in the meantime.</p>\n<p>By the time anaconda’s attention was back to Bony and Pilek again, everyone had already repositioned, back to square one, streaming attacks and gnawing the anaconda’s lifeforce little by little. The anaconda trapped in the rhythm created by Bony and his two lackeys, the beast realized these cursed humans were actually playing it around.</p>\n<p>With this kind of teamwork, actually, only the three of them would be able to deal with the anaconda as long as they didn’t get unlucky. But things wouldn’t be smooth as they planned. Because there was Bhela in the back who was completely out of sync with their rhythm.</p>\n<p>“Shit!”</p>\n<p>Bony cursed as he saw the beast changed its direction toward Bhela. He and two others forgot about Bhela because they thought they already got the anaconda by its tail. They broke their own flow and chased the beast madly--even Polio gave chase with his wooden staff--as they tried to get its attention back to them. But it was futile. The anaconda was mature and thus realized the best chance it got to damage its enemy was to deal with the Archer.</p>\n<p>Bhela saw the beast approaching her. Her gaze was straight, cold, decisive. She drew one arrow she marked beforehand from her quiver.</p>\n<p>“Bhela, what are you doing?! Quickly run away!” Bony’s thunderous shout frustratingly bolstered through the air.</p>\n<p>Yet Bhela hadn’t moved an inch from where she was standing. She quietly drew her bow and shot the arrow halfway between her and the anaconda. Her aim was fine up until then, but no one seemed to find her shooting this time was weird.</p>\n<p>“You want to get eaten? Shit, Malikh Family will kill me, I shouldn’t have been accepted assigned by this crazy girl!”</p>\n<p>At one side, two hidden masked women who were watching previously became alerted too. The one with the falcon mask took out a crossbow and began reloading it with one bolt.</p>\n<p>“Wait,” the owl stopped her colleague from aiming the crossbow at the beast. “Look closely at what Young Lady Bhela doing,” she said, her tone was restrained, not clear whether she was conflicted or being awed.</p>\n<p>As it turned out, Bhela had launched the third arrow. All of them aimed at the same position--an empty ground between her and the anaconda. And all of them marked by weird little flags colored with red, blue, green, and the fourth arrow, brown--all of them seemed to represented the elemental she had affinities with.</p>\n<p>By the time the anaconda unwittingly crushed the four marked arrow with its giant body, Bhela snapped her fingers and chanted, “Explosion.”</p>\n<p><em>BOOOOOMMMM!!!</em></p>\n<p>The beast’s body sprang onto the air by the sudden fissure produced from delayed magic arrows Bhela had launched. It wriggled in dirt as it tried to extinguish the magic flame that engulfed its body. Yet it wasn’t something as easy as it seemed to be.</p>\n<p>The flame was something Bhela made with one of her basic elemental magic arrow. It wasn’t anything lethal to the anaconda this size. But what made it terrifying was that, the moment Bhela shot another marked arrow to the flaming anaconda, the fire smoldered even bigger, almost burning the entire area if Bhela didn’t know how to control the fire with her water elemental magic arrows.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Bony and others stood speechlessly. They could only watched as Bhela shooting arrows like she was pouring gasoline. Seeing that there was still much arrows in her quivers, and seeing the magic arrows didn’t actually consume large enough mana, Bhela really did have a way to turn this fierce anaconda into a barbequed snake like she said when asking Bony and others to join her.</p>\n<p>However, not even she had done shaving half of the beast’s lifeforce Bhela suddenly stopped.</p>\n<p>She rubbed the wristband she had on her left hand as to summon a “Team Party” window. An ethereal panel floated before her, but there was nothing much in it beside the option to manage one party which she was in--which was led by Bony--and she tapped it quit.</p>\n<p><em>Bhela Malikh has left the party.</em></p>\n<p><em>Lyla Blackwood has left the party.</em></p>\n<p>“Eh?” Pilek was surprised. “That mentally challenged girl actually is a Blackwood?!”</p>\n<p>Bony and Polio were surprised too. They thought she would let them quit the party first as to not catching Lyla’s real identity. But Bhela just went ahead and made Lyla quit on her behalf.</p>\n<p>Pilek mused, “Thinking about it again, it’s quite strange why Bhela’s the one who initiated the party setup; they actually want to disguise the fact that Bhela’s cousin is actually a Blackwood Family’s maidservant!”</p>\n<p>Beside him, Polio wanted to correct his friend. “You birdbrain. Southern Mossack families have custom to grant surnames to outer family members and hardworking servants, but for foreign blood nobles--” he stopped, realized Bhela was glaring at him, then muttered, “never mind.”</p>\n<p>Bhela came to them and said, “Now you can finish it. I don’t need the experience it drops.”</p>\n<p>It wasn’t a problem for Bony and others if Bhela didn’t want the experience from killing a Level 19 Anaconda. The thing was, she took Lyla along with her.</p>\n<p>Bony said, “You okay for your cousin not receiving experience at the least? She’s still Level 6 Novice after all.”</p>\n<p>“She doesn’t need it,” Bhela replied flatly.</p>\n<p>Pilek laughed. “Your cousin’s level is the worst I’ve seen since Shira--and you said she doesn’t need free EXP? Young Lady Bhela, are you holding a grudge against that scatterbrain cousin of yours to hold her back from getting spoon fed from doing nothing?”</p>\n<p>Both Bony and Polio already were getting used to Pilek’s hobby to tease people. But Bhela wasn’t. She narrowed her eyes at them and said coldly, “Continue with what you’re doing. I’m going to hunt some wild goats.”</p>\n<p>Bhela turned around and left.</p>\n<p>As stupid as Pilek was, he did realize that Bhela was really angry. Bony said nothing and began approaching the flaming anaconda to chop it up. The atmosphere became stuck up, so Pilek smoothen it down with a series of fake coughs.</p>\n<p>Polio patted his shoulder, with a friendly smile, he gave him an advice, “You should’ve shut your damn mouth, man.”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Ever since Lyla found out that bunnies and kitties didn’t actually like her mountain harvests, she accepted the reality and reorganized her plans. Instead of gathering mushrooms and berries, now Lyla decided to gather mangoes.</p>\n<p>“Huup!” the girl exclaimed as she caught a falling mango with her bamboo basket.</p>\n<p>Since the mango tree grew on the ownerless mountain, nobody would complain if they gathered all the ripened fruits here. Up on the tree, Nilda, despite not wearing dress for girls, able to agilely maneuvered through branch to branch. Her nimble yet light movement looked as if she spent a quite part of her younger years to train in the art of climbing trees. She didn’t even broke it when she tip-toeing upon branches that almost as thin as twigs.</p>\n<p>“That’s it for ripen mangoes, young lady,” Nilda said as she sat on a leafless tree branch. “Everything else up here is still young and sour. Do you want them too?”</p>\n<p>Lyla took a big bite of one juicy ripened mango. This was Honey Mangoo so it was sweeter than average mangoo. “I don’t like sour fruits,” she replied.</p>\n<p>“But, Young Lady Lyla, have you tried eating Rujak?” Nilda then said with a mischievous smile.</p>\n<p>“Rujak?” Lyla blinked, “what’s that?”</p>\n<p>“You can think of Rujak as a sweet version of sambal--but for fruits!”</p>\n<p>Lyla gasped again. Sambal for fruits?</p>\n<p>“Quick, Nilda, quickly grab all those young mangoes!”</p>\n<p>Seeing that Lyla was very interested in Rujak, Nilda explained what Rujak was as she moved from branch to branch picking on young mangos. Like Sambal, Rujak used chillies for its base for the heat--only all Rujak recipes were added brown sugar to make them sweet. Most popular Rujak used sweetened peanut sauce like that modified version of what they used in Satay recipes. In the end, whatever kind of Rujak they were talking about, what Rujak was about was dressing sour fruits in spicy, sweet sauce, the sacred side dish that idle aunties liked to eat whenever they gathered to gossip.</p>\n<p>The more Nilda described it the more Lyla holding her drool. She couldn’t wait to ask Granny Litha to make her young mango Rujak with all these fruits she gathered.</p>\n<p><em>Crack!</em></p>\n<p>A noise of some twigs snapped was heard from the thick foliage behind them. Lyla turned her head, and found that there were sound of steps that was neither from her nor from Nilda. Her googly eyes peered through the obstacles. A bulky shadow could be seen through, too big for a human’s silhouette, approaching with nothing but two glimmering sharp vertical pupil eyes and the muffled low growling of a beast.</p>\n<p><em>Crack--crack…</em></p>\n<p>The beast revealed itself.</p>\n<p>Lyla blinked again. The beast which lowered its head before her was a kitty--a big kitty, stripped fur, baring strong fangs, deadly fangs. It took awhile for Lyla to recall that a kitty this big was called with another name--tiger. Tiger was the king of the mountain. And the king of the mountain didn’t seem to come here with the intention to play.</p>\n<p><em>Shuua.</em></p>\n<p>Nilda flawlessly landed just right in front of Lyla, protecting her sight from gazing through the prying eyes of the growling tiger.</p>\n<p>“Well, quite a big fellow, aren’t you?” Nilda had the corner of her mouth raised. “I won’t take another step forward if I were you.”</p>\n<p>The tiger stopped. From the way it hesitated it seemingly understood human speech, though common sense dictated it actually couldn’t. Seeing that the two girls before it weren’t armed enough to threaten it, the tiger then began taking another step forward.</p>\n<p><em>Whoooshh!</em></p>\n<p>The tiger yelped. Its instinctual primitive mind wasn’t fast enough to catch the reality had happened. In an instant, piercing pain stuck on its shoulder--a pain which immediately vanished as blood gushing throughout its body. The next thing it knew, its legs went wimp and it couldn’t move its body,</p>\n<p>“See? I told you.” Nilda squatted before the paralyzed beast, taunting it with a soft pat on its head.</p>\n<p>“Nilda,” someone called her name. Almost like feather, two shadows landed weightlessly behind her. Both figures hid their faces behind masks.</p>\n<p>“Big sisters, Young Lady Lyla is fine,” turning her head, Nilda whispered.</p>\n<p>The falcon mask, who had a crossbow in her hand, said also with a whisper, “The other kids are almost done with their business. They’ll come back soon. Keep an eye closely on Young Lady Lyla in case another wandering beast comes.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” Nilda eagerly said. “Is it okay Young Lady Lyla sees you?”</p>\n<p>“If it’s Young Lady Lyla I don’t see any problem with it,” the masked woman replied. This wasn’t the first time Lyla saw her and the girl didn’t seem to mind too much about them, two shadow agents that specialized in covert missions. They only revealed themselves in front of Lyla only because they reckoned that the airhead Lyla was too scatterbrain to disturb their daily missions.</p>\n<p>They didn’t notice but, Lyla, the subject in their secret conversation, had come to squat in front of the paralyzed tiger. She patted the beast’s head just like Nilda did before, but with a softer touch which invited a sad growl from the beast.</p>\n<p>“Eh? What are you doing, Young Lady Lyla?”</p>\n<p>By the time Nilda realized it, Lyla had already pulled out the poisoned bolt that stuck on the tiger’s shoulder and poured a whole vial of healing potion Bhela gave her before they climbed the mountain.</p>\n<p>Nilda’s expression was complicated. She asked again, “Why are you healing this one, Young Lady Lyla? It’s dangerous. What if it attacked you?”</p>\n<p>“It won’t,” Lyla said.</p>\n<p>Nilda thought Lyla was being mischievous again. So she kindly reminded, “Tigers have sharp fangs,” she said, “it can eat you the moment it’s able to move.”</p>\n<p>“No, it won’t,” Lyla said again. Her eyes glued to tiger that had giving up expression.</p>\n<p>At first, Nilda smiled as her brain tried to look for an excuse to make Lyla stay away from the beast. But she stopped when she saw the unusual light on Lyla’s eyes--her eyes were sad, but not exactly tearful. She gazed through the beast’s eyes with a trance of pity. It was an expression that no one would expect coming from a girl who liked hopping around to sing and dance all day around.</p>\n<p>Not long after that Bhela returned along with the boys who carried a goat’s carcass with them. Bhela thought Lyla’s cheerful singing would welcome her by the time she arrived, but the sight of a limping ferocious tiger made a visible turbulence through her face muscle.</p>\n<p>“What happened?” Bhela asked Nilda.</p>\n<p>“Don’t worry, Young Lady Bhela. This beast is poisoned, it can’t move--for now,” Nilda assured her.</p>\n<p>It was not that Bhela didn’t believe her, but upon seeing Lyla’s rare expression, she knew something else was going on.</p>\n<p>“Lyla,” Bhela squatted beside the girl, asked softly, “what happened?”</p>\n<p>Lyla rubbed the tiger’s head as she replied, “Aunty Tiger came here to ask for help.”</p>\n<p>The lack of usual enthusiasm in her reply made Bhela thinking about something.</p>\n<p>“What does she want us to do?” Bhela asked again.</p>\n<p>Lyla was silent for a moment, her fingers didn’t stop shuffling on the fur on the tiger’s forehead.</p>\n<p>“Her child--she’s looking for her child.”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked closely at the unmoving tiger before relied, “Then let’s help looking for her cub.”</p>\n<p>Lyla looked at Bhela and blinked.</p>\n<p>“Can we, really?”</p>\n<p>“Mn.” Bhela assured with a nod.</p>\n<p>Lyla felt happy for the tiger. She hopped around and regained her usual happy self. While she promised cheerfully to the paralyzed tiger that she and Bhela--who could do anything according to her--would help the beast to look for its cub, the latter then came to Bony and two other boys to employ them again to search for the missing cub.</p>\n<p>“Somehow, I felt this girl paid us to be her lackeys from the start,” Pilek lamented. Beside futilely fought the anaconda only to see Bhela defeat it alone, the only meaningful job they had been doing this time was carrying a dead goat for her. She didn’t say it, but apparently Bhela wanted for paid porters, not bodyguards or party members.</p>\n<p>Before set out to do the new task they got, Bony led his two lackeys to put the goat’s carcass below a shadowy tree. At that moment his eyes swept on the ordinary maidservant that he knew working in his family, then glanced at the pitiful tiger on the ground. He caught a striking old slashing wound on the tiger’s face. His father told him about a particular tiger that once Elzhier Family tried to subjugate, of which his father proudly claimed he succeed in slashing the beast’s face despite of failure in bringing it down. Thinking that, he looked at the maidservant again. Nilda caught him looking at her way, thus she respectfully bowed as the customary of one servant to her master. Bony turned and said nothing in the end.</p>\n<p>“Let’s go,” Bony brought the two others away to look for one tiger cub. At least for generous payment and opportunity to raise his level, Bony could look for the young beast until the sun lowered.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Bhela would be going to look for the cub along with Lyla.</p>\n<p>“Nilda, please stay here to look over the mother tiger,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“You can count me on that, Young Lady Bhela.”</p>\n<p>Lyla came to the paralyzed tiger again and put two ripened mangoes before the beast.</p>\n<p>“Here, Aunty Tiger. You can eat these while we’re searching your kitty for you!”</p>\n<p>Bhela wanted to say that neither tigers, bunnies nor kitties ate mangoes. But Lyla’s determined face made her hold her tongue.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The moment Nilda was alone, two silhouettes who hid their presence when the others were here, returned unapologizingly as they checked on the helpless mother tiger.</p>\n<p>“Didn’t expect for Young Lady Lyla reacted that way, I should’ve used another bolt if I knew it will be going like this,” the falcon mask said. For the trained eyes like these masked women, they didn’t need to use magic items or particular skill to know that there was no hope for this beast. “Oh, well--” she took out a dagger, and put the tiger’s out of its misery, “--you told that young lady an excuse for this, Nilda.”</p>\n<p>Nilda looked at the fresh blood that gushed out from the tiger’s slit throat. “I’ll say it suddenly has a fever and died.”</p>\n<p>Standing in the back, the woman with owl mask, opened her mouth after a deep thought, “About Young Lady Lyla--do we know anything about her?”</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Lyla?” the falcon mask stood up after wiping the blood from her dagger. “She’s from Blackwood, quite a cute girl for someone who is slow learner.” Slow learner was a polite tone to imply that for a fourteen years old girl with only Level 6 Novice was considered behind the standard, even for commoners who couldn’t afford to buy Boost Elixir in bulk like Blackwood Family was.</p>\n<p>Though her face was hidden, it was obvious the owl masked woman had something she wanted to say.</p>\n<p>“Sister Owl, do you have something on your mind?” Nilda asked curiously.</p>\n<p>“Well, she’s actually was posted back in the seminars that those girls attended, so she’s quite concerned about them,” the falcon mask teased from the side.</p>\n<p>The owl didn’t humor her partner’s teasing and instead said seriously, “I just noticed after the boys mentioned it--but I guess it’s true, something about Young Lady Bhela diberelatedly suppressed Young Lady Lyla from leveling up.” She took a beat, explaining, “I’ve seen Young Lady Bhela trained diligently and is very disciplined toward herself. But I haven’t seen her use the slightest bit of her attention to train Young Lady Lyla.”</p>\n<p>“I think you’re overthinking it, Sister,” Nilda said sweetly. “Young Lady Lyla is very spoiled, you see. That’s because Young Lady Bhela pampered her a little bit too much.”</p>\n<p>The one who disagreed with Nilda was the falcon mask instead. “You don’t know that she’s taking Young Lady Lyla with her out of the party before the anaconda was slain.”</p>\n<p>The expression on Nilda’s face showed a hint of surprise. “Really?”</p>\n<p>“It’s what really happened,” the falcon said, her voice sounded dry.</p>\n<p>“But why Young Lady Bhela do that to her own friend?” Nilda asked.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, not long after they went looking for the missing cub, Bhela and Lyla found a scene that quite peculiar. On the brown mountain ground was pool of blood, gushed out from the two dead beasts that both seemed to die after fighting each other. One tiger and the other was golden fur gorilla. Both had majestic appearance which suggested the were the kind that ruled the Badril Mountain before this tragedy happened. Bhela, who felt slight dizzy from the excessive smell of blood, wanted to pull Lyla from there.</p>\n<p>“Nuu, Sis Bhela,” Lyla struggled, then continued saying, “behind the rock, behind the rock!”</p>\n<p>Bhela’s perception as an Unique Class Archer was enhanced and soon knew there was something moving behind the rock Lyla pointed at. When they came to check it out, immediately a tiger cub welcomed them with a lazy yawning.</p>\n<p>“Huu… here kitty kitty kitty…”</p>\n<p>Lyla picked up the tiger cub and hugged it dearly.</p>\n<p>Somehow Bhela found this cub wasn’t even bothered by the ghastly scene happened nearby. She looked again at the dead tiger, and back at the cub, and concluded that the father ought to be dead defending the little one. Yet the tiger cub looked it just wanted to back to sleep, had little care with the tragedy befell it.</p>\n<p>“Ssuuush shuuush suuushh… it’s okay kitty, it’s okay, you’ll be my little friend from now own. Sis Bhela and me will be your new sisters!”</p>\n<p>The cub yawned again. It didn’t want to bother with this human girl speaking. It snuggled in Lyla’s bosom and slept. Only a moment later Bhela learned that the cub’s cubby body actually had slightly shaken in its slept--and only when Lyla tried very hard to pet the cub, it began to be calm again.</p>\n<p>“Lyla, we can’t stay here after dark, so we must return back immediately if we want people to give the Father Tiger a proper burial today,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>They walked out of the bloody place with a new companion with them. Bhela silently looking for a striking detail of the place so that she could send people here without her guiding her. Since Lyla already said that they’d be the cub’s sisters, then it was within reason for Bhela to respect the cub’s deceased relatives.</p>\n<p>“Ssuuusshh suuushhhh…” Lyla pet the cub in her bosom again after a muffled welp escaped the cub’s mouth. “It’s okay… it’s okay… your parents must forbid you to cry, isn’t it? Poor kitty, poor kitty… sleep sleep sleep now sleep.”</p>\n<p>While Lyla’s whole attention was on the tiger cub, Bhela looked around to see whether a third person was there to listen to their conversation, including the masked women from the sect she was friendly with. Only after she making sure they were alone did she stopped Lyla’s steps.</p>\n<p>“Lyla,” Bhela said, “you still remember what I told you about the voices?”</p>\n<p>“To not anybody knows I can hear them?”</p>\n<p>“Listen, Lyla, after we get together with the others, Nilda likely will say something to you.”</p>\n<p>“About what?” Lyla asked to express her ignorance, but failed to hide the hint of sadness and disappointment mixed in her tone.</p>\n<p>“Lyla…” Bhela squat to get below the Lyla’s eyes level, trying to be patient with her, “you know tigers usually are very dangerous and not uncommon for them to eat people. Sister Bhela, too, if don’t know about the voices that come to you, wouldn’t dare to take chances when it comes to your life. Our friends wanted to protect you, Lyla, they meant well. You can pout but you must not hold your anger.”</p>\n<p>Lyla’s mind filled with fun things and fluffy stuffs. So if people didn’t try to make her listen most likely she wouldn’t retained what she heard in her airy head. So whenever Bhela wanted to make sure Lyla listened she’d look into her eyes. Eventually, Lyla relented, her shoulder dropped and a rare sigh could be heard from that mouth that she usually used to yelling and singing cheerfully.</p>\n<p>“Why you must tell me this, Sis Bhela? I’m not the one who lost their parents.”</p>\n<p>“You’re right,” Bhela patted the tiger cub’s head. “I know this is a very hard favor. But can you learn to forgive, little one?” While Bhela tried to explaining things to the cub, this little beast raised its head that was buried in Lyla’s bosom, took a glance at Bhela’s face, then it yawned again and sleep.</p>\n<p>It felt weird to coax a beast that hadn’t even developed its intelligence yet. But the moment Bhela saw the relief on Lyla’s face, she knew everything worked out for the better. With the sleepy companion the had just found, Lyla and Bhela returned to regroup with others.</p>\n<p>“You’re okay kitty?” Lyla uttered as the tiger moved in her bosom, “really, aren’t you a little big for a kitty?”</p>\n<p>The tiger cub woke up from its sleep, maybe because it smelt its mother’s presence just nearby. A hint of teary mist formed on the corner of its eyes. Lyla bitterly smiled, immediately coaxed the little one, “It’s okay, kitty, we’re with you. We’re family now,” she said. “And since we’re family…” she mused, stopped her steps, then raised the fellow little tiger up in the air, exclaiming, “how about I give you a new name? You’re big, and you’re a kitty--how about I name you Mister Kitty?”</p>\n<p>The cub yawned, seemed not too eager with its new name Lyla had bestowed. But the girl found it quite nice to her ears, so she decided to settle with the name. “You’re going to start a new life from now on! Let’s properly say your farewell to your parents! Come on, Mister Kitty! We need to get moving, Mister Kitty!”</p>\n<p>Lyla excitedly repeated Mister Kitty here Mister Kitty there. She was quite pleased with the name, obviously. Yet seeing that the girl became cheerful again, Bhela didn’t have the heart to tell her that the cub was, in fact, a female.</p>\n<hr>\n","unregistered":[]},"novels/yashura-legacy/contents/volume-1/chapter-2.md":{"contributions":{"MyProofreader":2},"lastModified":1605165056735,"data":{"title":"Hope","proofreader":"MyProofreader"},"body":"<p>Dinner at Malikh Family; the family hall bustling with relatives who wanted to celebrate Bhela Malikh’s return. Even though the expensive Ngajen Ceremony drew near a good number of ducks and a goat were butchered along with their spice reserves taken out. There were laughters, there lots of people wanted to get on the good side of the only Young Lady of Malikh Family.</p>\n<p>But Bhela’s face was straight the whole time. Given choices, she’d rather have a small dinner with her mother and sick father right now.</p>\n<p>“I heard you went to Elzhier’s training facility as soon as you arrived, young lady,” a bald elder said with big smile. “That is no good. You just return home after four days of traveling. You must have a good rest first.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you for your concern, Elder Jhamil.”</p>\n<p>Bhela had experience with people during her two years abroad to know the meaning of smiles like Elder Jhamil’s--the kind of smile that didn’t reach eyes, the fake kind of smile. She always found it was uncomfortable whenever she met with one. Yet what was more uncomfortable was the fact she was the star of the party. Flatteries and congratulations flowing in. Bhela kept nodding her head and had a smiling expression on her face. No one really had a good time beside the ignorant families who came to find abundant foods to eat.</p>\n<p>Finally toward the end of the big dinner Elder Jhamil gave a few speeches and led everyone for their patriarch's health. Bhela hadn’t come home for two years, but she was alert enough to know the popular opinion going around inside the Malikh Family. She knew her father was disliked by many because the engagement he set up more than a dozen years ago, back when she wasn’t even able to speak yet, back when the Malikhs didn’t think much of it and didn’t know the girl back then would grow splendidly into a fair Young Lady. What she didn’t expect was that, Elder Jhamil, would point it out in front of other family members.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady, I’m sure you’re aware about it by now, but the one from Yashura Family is still stuck on the same level from back when you were leaving for your seminars.”</p>\n<p>“I’m aware, yes,” she said. “And?”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil smiled dryly at the question, he said, “With a partner that lazy he’d drag you sooner or later, wouldn’t he? Especially with special talent as yours, many would have second thoughts. But then how about you? Are you fine with that, Young Lady?”</p>\n<p>Bhela didn’t immediately say what was on her mind. She quietly picked the warm ginger drink they served her, drank it, while her eyes glanced at a certain direction where two maidservants who immediately glanced down the moment her eyes came into contact with theirs.</p>\n<p>Seeing that Bhela wasn’t that responsive with the idea, Elder Jhamil spoke further, “Young Lady, don’t worry, we as Malikhs only worried about your future. If you feel injustice in your heart, you must be brave, you must voice it out to your parents, Young Lady Bhela--all of us Malikhs support you for whichever path you choose! Isn’t that right, everyone?”</p>\n<p>“That’s right!” someone shouted. Then came more rougher voice--</p>\n<p>“We don’t fear those Yashura’s retaliation, Young Lady. You don’t have to be afraid they’ll come here to bully us because of that trash from Yashura Family!”</p>\n<p>“We support you, Young Lady!”</p>\n<p>“Don’t be afraid!”</p>\n<p>The dry smile on Elder Jhamil turned elated when people were chanting along with his cue. It was only when Bhela slowly put down the warm glass of ginger drink in her hand did they stop making ruckus, everyone was waiting for what Bhela was going to say next.</p>\n<p>“I think,” Bhela said with the remarkable cold expression of hers, “any engagement in the main family should be the main family’s business only.”</p>\n<p>She stopped. Not a single more soul dared to send her further flatteries until dinner was over. Even the bald Elder Jhamil, the most enthusiastic of all them, quietly sat back where he belonged.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>“Ah, young lady, please wait, Young Lady Bhela!” the bald Elder Jhamil chased her, trotting, with a box in his hands.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh frowned upon hearing the voice. But she hid her expression well as turned around and asked, “Is something the matter, Elder Jhamil?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, in fact, there’s one matter a bit inappropriate to deal in the family hall,” as soon as Elder Jhamil said that, he opened the box he carried. It was a dress. “It’s something that I get from a merchant who has a lot of dealing with people in the west. He told me this is apparently the current popular fashion for western nobles. I think it’s good for Young Lady.”</p>\n<p>Bhela studied Elder Jhamil’s expression. If the dress truly was a fashionable goods then the elder ought to have paid a quite of coins to get this. As far as Bhela Malikh remembered, Elder Jhamil she knew wasn’t this kind even when her father the patriarch married. Naturally with such an expensive homecoming gift, Bhela was alerted.</p>\n<p>“Thank you for your kindness, Elder Jhamil. Bhela will treasure this well.”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, you don’t have to mention it, Young Lady Bhela,” Elder Jhamil said with a laugh. Then, while rubbing his palms unconsciously, the bald elder began to smile--not a fake one like he usually did have, a genuine smile, one that reflected his current emotion--the smile of greed. “By the way, young lady,” he continued, “I heard you getting along well with the Young Master from the noble Blackwood Family during your time away…”</p>\n<p>“Young Lady of Blackwood Family is my friend,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“Yeah but… I also heard in the next ngajen ceremony, Young Master Blackwood would grace us with his presence… is that true?”</p>\n<p>“I wouldn’t know.”</p>\n<p>“Hehe,” Elder Jhamil chuckled knowingly. “I think things would go well if you wear that dress during ngajen ceremony, young lady.”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh said a short and ambiguous reply and tried to get away from the bald elder. After she escaped in the lone corridor, she took out the dress from the box. The said dress was glimmering under the torchlight, yet, in spite of that, Bhela wasn’t happy the slightest bit.</p>\n<p>“This kind of thing…”</p>\n<p>A proper dress for ladies of southern people was hiding everything below the collarbone. Showing more, akin to invite men to do something indecent. Bhela wasn’t a conservative to follow Mossack customes down rigidly as shown from her cutting her hair short despite the gesture usually reserved for unavailable widows. But still, something like decency of girlhood, was something even someone duller than Bhela should have. Even daring courtesans would think twice to wear this kind of provocative dress to attend a festivity made by the Mossack majority.</p>\n<p>It was distasteful. Bhela didn’t want to think too much about it. After putting back the dress, Bhela walked again to the east wing of Malikh Family where her father was resting.</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim Malikh’s sick room once used as the family’s <b>Alchemist</b> workplace. It had long been vacant, thus usually used to care sick and injured people, as it had the most complete medicinal facility in the entire Malikh Family. Upon entering the room, Bhela found the thick pungent of herbs made her head light. And still she was amazed by how loyal her mother was to taking care of her father closely when servants would need to take a breather of fresh air ten minutes inside the sick room.</p>\n<p>“Father, mother, I’m back…. Did they send some food here?”</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh, the mother, was the one who replied to Bhela. “They did. Some people might forget about the patriarch’s little family but there are still good aunties working in the kitchen,” a middle-aged woman said with a hint of sadness, helplessness, and resentment.</p>\n<p>“Does mother want some hot tea? I’ll go fetch and say my thanks for those good aunties,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“You girl, sit down. You just returned today, now you want to run around doing errands?” Madam Malikh smiled weakly. “How’s the village, dear? Does it change from the way you remembered?”</p>\n<p>“Somes changed, others stay the same, mother,” Bhela said. She got to the table and put the box Elder Jhamil gifted, then took it off her mind. She then picked a random book from the shelves. “Can I stay here for a while?” she asked while showing the book to her mother, telling her the intention that she was going to read it there.</p>\n<p>The mother’s smile turned strained. At noon, she purposely told this daughter of hers to see around the village because she was afraid, if Bhela spent too much time in this room, she would feel uncomfortable by the thick medicinal smell and grow to hate the idea of staying. Even some maidservants a few years older than her were fidgeting and eyeing for the door every time they had duty to bring a meal here. Yet, looking from her daughter’s unflinching eyes, Madam Malikh was relented in the end.</p>\n<p>“Sit here,” the mother offered her chair for her daughter, while she sat down on the edge of her husband’s bed.</p>\n<p>Bhela’s moved with small, noiseless steps, trying not to wake up her father. But it was unfortunate that her father woke up nonetheless.</p>\n<p>“Le… letter…”</p>\n<p>The quivering voice escaped his cracking dry lips.</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh wanted to retort. Not the letter again. No matter how many times she read it aloud he still thirst for the letter as if it was the only salvation left for his life. Nonetheless, she surrendered and she picked a smooth, white paper made from wood--the kind which was expensive and usually used overseas--and began to read its content.</p>\n<p>“I understand your situation. But sending help from where I am takes a while. Ask Yulong’s help for now.”</p>\n<p>As if the letter was his assurance, Patriarch Ghalim Malikh closed his eyes again.</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at her mother who folded the recently opened letter, she asked. “Whose letter is that?”</p>\n<p>“Your great-grandmother who lived overseas,” her mother said.</p>\n<p>“I see.” Bhela wasn’t sure which relative her mother mentioned, but she decided to ask something else seeing her mother’s bad mood. “Why Great-grandmother mentioned something about Yulong? Isn’t Yulong the Yashura Family’s butler, mother?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know, I reckon she told us to rely on Yashura Family instead.”</p>\n<p>The strained smile on her mother’s face made Bhela realize that even her mother was reluctant when Yashura Family was mentioned. As a mother, she loved Bhela dearly, and was the one to believe in her daughter before everyone else. She believed in her daughter’s future. That was why she was first to oppose Bhela’s engagement when the sour rumors about the heir of the Yashura Family started. Never would she expect that her Malikh Family would be in dire straits so suddenly they needed Yashura Family’s help to get them out of this mess.</p>\n<p>“Have you sent someone to inform Yulong, mother?” Bhela asked.</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh shook her head. Bhela reckoned with Elder Jhamil gaining influence so fast, her mother wouldn’t know anyone to trust in this kind of situation.</p>\n<p>The girl then gave her mother a glass of water to ease her down. “I’ll let him know then,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Dear,” Madam Malikh brushed her daughter’s hair as she smiled helplessly, “showing your face in Yashura Family might complicate things…”</p>\n<p>Bhela patted her mother’s hands and assured her, “Don’t worry, mother,” she said, “I’ll ask favors from people I know from Elzhier Family.”</p>\n<p>Bhela thought her parents would go along with her arrangement. Madam Malikh hung open her lips as if she wanted to say something, but then she tightened her smile in the end. Unexpectedly, it was a weak voice that disagreed instead.</p>\n<p>“Bhela… don’t...” her father whispered weakly.</p>\n<p>“Dear?” mother leaned on toward his mouth.</p>\n<p>“What is it, father?” Bhela, too, leaned closer.</p>\n<p>“Don’t… ask… don’t… favor… purple...” the sickly patriarch’s voice turned hoarse and defragmented before he completed his sentences. Bhela and her mother quickly shushed him, they couldn’t afford to see the sick father forcing himself with this condition. Even after two minutes, he still struggled to tell his words to his daughter. Though eventually he fell to slumber by himself after his wife tried to put him to sleep with her eyes wet with tears.</p>\n<p>Beside her mother, Bhela picked a bamboo fan and used it to make a breeze for her father’s sleep to be more comfortable. Her expression was flat and straight the entire time, but inside, she was disturbed by the words her father failed to tell her.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>For as long as the Yashuras knew him, their Young Master Shira Yashura lived alone in his house. The only other person who should’ve been living here, his father, didn’t come home for months already. So ever since his uncle let him live in his house a few years back, Shira enjoyed an independent lifestyle he’d take for granted one of these days.</p>\n<p>At night, his schedule often filled with working on painting commissions Good-Natured Spirit gave him. Which, unfortunately, not something he wished for people to know. This part of his schedule was one of his secrets, if known by a certain meddlesome cousin, hell would surely be waiting for him.</p>\n<p>“I told you again and again,” a voice from behind him blurted, “you should’ve shown the boobs a little more.”</p>\n<p>Shira turned his head and groaned when he found the Nalaq’s annoying face a little bit too close. “Can you knock the door first?”</p>\n<p>“No way. I came through the wall. Door? What is door? Never use the thing since ages ago.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t creep up from behind, then. At least preserve your dignity as a Nalaq.”</p>\n<p>“I told you, don’t call me Nalaq,” Good-Natured Spirit hissed. “Anyway, boobs! The bweebs!! Make it more sexy! More bold and open!”</p>\n<p>“That’s not what we agreed on,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“Just a little, man. A little dot--tiny nipply dot--that’s all I’m asking for.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t push it, old man.”</p>\n<p>“Ah! You’re not fun anymore,” Good-Natured Spirit moaned in disatisfaction. In addition of Nalaq, Good-Natured Spirit was never fond of being called old. He died in his early thirty. So he retained the look, and he--according to himself--was still as handsome as ever. “Ah, forget it,” he waved his hand lazily. “Your drawings are second-rate porns anyway.”</p>\n<p>“You’re not paying for this one again?” Shira asked.</p>\n<p>“Not this one. Too safe. Don’t want it. At least make her boobs and butt bigger for the next time.”</p>\n<p>Shira sighed and wrapped it up for tonight. Everytime Good-Natured Spirit cancelled the commission's Shira wouldn’t have any choice but selling the paintings half-baked to a peddler he knew. Not even a half price, he’d be lucky if the rejected paintings would sell even one-fifth from Good-Natured Spirit’s usual payment.</p>\n<p>While Shira was tidying up his room, Good-Natured Spirit looked at the lady in the painting. The Nalaq said, “Hmm. I gotta say, man, despite your second-rate skill you’re natural when it comes to drawing faces. Especially the eyes. How should I say this… those aren’t the eyes of cheap bitches usually have, I tell you.”</p>\n<p>Shira didn’t know whether he should feel flattered or not. After he tidied the room and hid the naughty painting carefully, he prepared to go to sleep.</p>\n<p>“Oh, by the way,” Good-Natured Spirit said as Shira changed his shirt, “I’ve checked on your girl, brat. She’s a real good beauty, alright. Her talent too is not to be scoffed at. And also--boobs.”</p>\n<p>Shira glanced at him with tightened brows. “I’ll be troubled if they somehow trace it back to me in case the Young Lady of Malikh Family was assaulted.”</p>\n<p>“Hehe, relax man, I’ll never touch my buddy’s chick. We’re buddies, aren’t we?”</p>\n<p>Shira wanted to say no but he felt it’d be better for him not to comment on that. He then hurriedly kicked out the Nalaq so he could get some sleep in peace.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In almost all of Mossack race traditions, ngajen ceremony held monthly in villages near a mountain. It was one of those legacy of ancient Mossack that still around simply because of its practice brought safety to the people. Originally was a session of prayers and offerings to calm down Selaqs which dwelling on the mountains--they had to, because many stories being passed down in every families that even ancient tribe chieftains and heroes couldn’t do nothing if waves of Selaqs rampaged over the southern lands. Though, as the cost of ceremony getting more expensive as the time went on and getting more political, nowadays it became a time of feasts for big families to assert their surrounding influence. And a time of feasts where small and independent families gained side incomes from providing food and good for the big families’ feats. Ngajen ceremony was also the main reason why there was a weird rule for every Mossack-rooted families, tribes, and clans, that saying the leaders must be someone of a great cook--the majority of them were simply foodies.</p>\n<p>“And thus, Shira my boy--” the patriarch said as he played with his thick moustache, “--us southern people are naturally different from those imperialist western Haldeens and those warmongers feudalists of eastern Kaya. We don’t simply become leaders because of our noble bloodlines or merits and achievements in battle but simply because of food. This is an important lesson, my boy: no matter one hails from a noble blood or being a simple commoner, no matter one’s an enemy or ally, in the end, everyone’s going to eat happily and peacefully when we southern cooks shove foods up in their mouths. Remember that.”</p>\n<p>Shira Yashura quietly nodded. He didn’t plan to learn cooking from the start but, as the heir of Yashura Family, spending effort on foods probably one of the most important lessons before he became the next Patriarch of Yashura Family.</p>\n<p>“So you understand. Good. Sooner or later you’ll understand being strong is not everything, having talent is not everything,” the patriarch said. “Look at your father, for instance. He’s the only one in Badril Village who has an Unique class since… I don’t know, many many years. He’s pretty badass, eh? But why is that the one who ended up being the patriarch was me?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, Uncle Shuro, please do tell me.”</p>\n<p>Shuro Yashura, the patriarch uncle, smiled as he looked at his obedient nephew. He then half-bragging said, “Because he can only boil water, that’s why. Cooking is a great heritage of our ancestors thus those who have no talent on it as to be satisfied with being a second-rate Mossack. The only reason why people like me always ended up becoming the leader of clans because we Mossack appreciate food to a very high degree. Justice is food. Food is justice. With great cooking comes great responsibility.”</p>\n<p>But from the side a sour voice butted in, “Ohh. You’ll never know how much bullshit my father made up just now.”</p>\n<p>Uncle and nephew turned their heads to see a daughter pop her head from the window. Apparently, Mila Yashura had just returned from doing morning errands.</p>\n<p>“What are you guys doing anyway?” she asked. Apparently, in the kitchen, she saw her father and cousin shredding a ridiculous amount of coconuts. No one else was here in the kitchen, so Mila asked, “Did you two really do these by all yourselves?”</p>\n<p>“Of course,” her father, the revered patriarch, said as his hand vigorously shredded coconut. He couldn’t hide the annoying proud smile on his mustache filled face.</p>\n<p>“Since dawn?” Mila asked again suspiciously.</p>\n<p>“Food is justice. Justice is food. With great cooking comes great responsibility. Shredding coconut is one of the fundamental lessons for Shira to become a great patriarch in the future.”</p>\n<p>“Well,” Mila commented, “that’s dumb.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, girl! What do you know? You know nothing about the important philosophy behind every essence of coconuts,” Shuro Yashura exploded. “Since you a girl who don’t have to lead the family then probably you’ll never understand. You’ll never have to understand the hidden substance of every food you’ve eaten! Almost every Mossack delicacies made with coconuts. That Bulayak Satay sauce you like so much is made with coconut milk as a base! And don’t forget goat stew! And baked shredded coconuts cookies! And rendang! You name it. Coconuts have been granted us with delicious foods ever since ancestors were hunters-gatherers! Our very roots of being the descendants of ancient Mossack race can be traced as long as one ponder the mystery behind every shred of coconuts! Look at ancient empires! The ancient Aratararadararam Empire, for an instance, five thousands years ago, formed their empire solely by cultivating lots of coconut trees! They’re building civilizations relying only on the blessing of coconuts! That’s how great coconuts are! Only us who were born to lead our very empire can understand how miraculous are to be feeling joyous in pondering the great essence of shredded coconuts. You don’t know this much then you’re a dumb girl, eh. What a waste of a daughter you are!!” After taking a deep breath, Patriarch Shuro snorted at his impudent daughter, then glanced at Shira, smiling. “Isn’t that right, Shira my boy?”</p>\n<p>That was dumb. Even Shira knew that much. Because of that he kept his head hung low and focused on his task of shredding coconuts, pretending not to hear the question coming at him.</p>\n<p>“See?” the patriarch smirked. “He’s too absorbed by the grace of shredding coconuts he doesn’t notice my words.”</p>\n<p>Mila rolled her eyes, began to ignore her father. “Anyway, Shira! Have you heard the story about that girl Malikh beating up the best Archer kid single-handedly?”</p>\n<p>Shira of course knew about the archery duel that happened yesterday. Because Yashura Family and Malikh Family were entangled in a planned marriage, almost everyone in Yashura Family--including servants and clueless children--were talking about it. Yet he couldn’t raise his head and answer. Do that, and his uncle Shuro would know he only pretended to be interested in shredding coconuts. He’d only hurt his uncle’s feelings that way. Thus, in spite of Mila being overly loud today, all Shira needed to do was shredding and shredding and sometimes stopped to feel the shredded coconuts with his fingers, releasing a solemn sigh, as if he found something profound in every fiber of shredded coconuts.</p>\n<p>“That’s my boy, you understand all too well after all,” Shuro Yashura nodded in satisfaction. He was relieved his successor could be that enlightened by the grace of shredded coconuts. He then glared at his own blood daughter, who supposed to be the princess of the family, nagging so loudly that she stood in borderline of being a tomboy girl and a fussy aunty.</p>\n<p>“Oh, man, just leave him alone, would ya? Just think how many years for him to catch up with his girl--the more you hold him back the more people talk shit about him, father!”</p>\n<p>“Please dear! Is that how you talk with your father? I’m not holding him back, okay?” Patriarch Shuro Yashura then asked Shira, “do I hold you back, Shira my boy?”</p>\n<p>Shira further lowered his head and pretended not to hear that as if he was a turtle.</p>\n<p>“Better be careful. He’s too deep in coconuts he doesn’t even hear me,” the patriarch gave his daughter a glare.</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura rolled her eyes. She crouched and disappeared from the window view, then stood up again a moment later. Her hand clutching a pebble.</p>\n<p>The patriarch gawked, “Oi, what are you--”</p>\n<p>Mila aimed the pebble at Shira and it hit his head with an audible knock.</p>\n<p>“Thousands of gods!” Shira swore.</p>\n<p>“Too deep my ass,” Mila sneered. Unlike her father, she knew too well whenever Shira playing dumb.</p>\n<p>“What do you want?” Shira asked as he rubbed his head.</p>\n<p>“Let’s train your sword skill. You don’t want to face your fiancée with that crappy skill of yours, do you?”</p>\n<p>Shira glanced at his uncle unwillingly. “Do I have to meet with Bhela in her Family?”</p>\n<p>“That’s right, Shira my boy. You rarely visit other houses during ngajen ceremony but old folks from the Elder Council think this is a good time to show Malikh Family our good will,” Shuro Yashura said. “Remember to pray for their patriarch’s health too. He’s your father best friend, after all.”</p>\n<p>As if waiting for Patriarch Shuro’s completed his words, the door of the kitchen knocked at the very moment. A tall gray-haired old man entered. He had a posture that was straight and sharp, classy western-style butler uniform that hadn’t had looked worn out in spite no tailors around to know how to sew the said uniform, and his hand was balanced to hold a tray with a dozen elixirs on top of it with his left hand fingers, while his right hand rested on his back as if he followed an etiquette stranger to most of the villagers. He was the sole butler in Yashura Family--and perhaps, the only butler that ever employed in Badril VIllage.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira, this month’s elixirs your father sent for you have arrived,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Thank you, Yulong.”</p>\n<p>As usual, Shira drank elixirs his father sent abroad without a rest. The content was painfully bitter, thank goodness Yulong provided brown sugars for the boy to nibble after he drank those. His father Jhuro Yashura said--in a letter from abroad--that the elixirs were some kind of nutrient custom-made only for Shira, were expensive, so they could only afford them every one or two months.</p>\n<p>“How do you feel, Shira my boy?”</p>\n<p>Shira said as he munched a brown sugar to dismiss the bitter after taste. “Uh-hm. Better?”</p>\n<p>The family always thought they were a level-boost potion, Jhuro once sent a potion that could increase Shira’s level up to Level 3 in a single gulp after all. But the elixirs seemed to do nothing other than let Shira sleep comfortably at night. Still, his relatives, especially Mila, put their hopes on the resourceful Jhuro Yashura to nurture his own son--the heir of Yashura Family.</p>\n<p>Seeing the lack of enthusiasm in his nephew’s eyes, Patriarch Shuro laughed and said, “Haha. If those don’t work on your progress problems, don’t let it bother you! Your father worked very hard as an instructor in second-rank school and he’d definitely send a better elixir, like that one from three years ago!”</p>\n<p>“Oh,” Shira nodded. The elixir from three years ago was special. He knew it the moment he drank the potion. The warm feeling surrounding his manasphere was special, as with only drinking from one bottle, he leveled up 2 levels overnight.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>After that his uncle let him go out of the kitchen, since it was promised that Shira would do errands for his aunt every morning.</p>\n<p>When he was heading off for his duty, Shira Yashura got pranked by Good-Natured Spirit in the hallway, popped out his head from a wall and cried, “Boo!”--which Shira ignored because Yulong the butler was walking behind him.</p>\n<p>Yulong said with a polite baritone voice of his, “Young Master Shira, do you perhaps would visit the peddler today?”</p>\n<p>Shira looked at the butler. The matter about him doing business with a peddler wasn’t known to the family; but since Yulong wasn’t a Yashura and had been taking care of him since little, he eventually knew about the few investment deals that Shira never talked about. After collecting his thoughts, the boy replied to Yulong’s question, “Depends on the errand I receive, really. My aunt still hasn’t given my errands this morning,” the boy said.</p>\n<p>“I see, Patriarch Shuro took your time since early morning, so if madam doesn’t take pity for you then young master would finish today’s morning errands a little too late.”</p>\n<p>“The market would be too crowded if that happened,” Shira lamented. It couldn’t be helped. Boys and girls around ages of nine and sixteen--before they received coming-of-age ceremony--had to finish several trivial tasks each morning from both parents. It was a custom mainly to educate filial piety, though some smart parents and big family policies would give errands for the young’uns to make them do things that were beneficial for their futures, like street smarts and forming their own social circles outside the playmates they met everyday. Because his mother wasn’t here since he was a baby, and his father never came home for months, it was his aunt who always gave him errands.</p>\n<p>“Young Master,” Yulong stopped him again, “I’m glad for Young Master taking initiatives to improve your life. You grow too fast for this old butler to look after you. But as a child stepping into the adult world, please let me give you a small advice.”</p>\n<p>“I’m all ears, Yulong.”</p>\n<p>Yulong said, “You cannot guarantee everyone’s nature all around you, Young Master. Especially those who come approaching you with impure motives. I hope Young Master understands this, and to not make friends with nasty people.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit, who was around, snorted.</p>\n<p>Shira pretended he didn’t hear the Nalaq and nodded at the butler’s words. “You don’t have to worry about the peddler. Even though he’s been peddling for two years now, I found the fella got a pretty good sense.”</p>\n<p>“Hearing your words relieves me greatly. Thank you.”</p>\n<p>Afterward, Yulong excused himself as he needed to check the servants’ works for the arrangement of Ngajen Ceremony. The butler unassumingly walked on the side of the corridor, avoiding Good-Natured Spirit who was floating in the way, as if he knew there was something unpleasant floating in the way.</p>\n<p>“So long, fucker,” Good-Natured Spirit flashed his middle finger to Yulong’s back who just passed him by. Of course, the old butler didn’t show any reaction to his insult.</p>\n<p>“Why did you always do that to him?” Shira said to him with a frown.</p>\n<p>“This middle finger?” Good-Natured Spirit asked back.</p>\n<p>“No, the insult.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit grinned.</p>\n<p>“You know nothing about this middle finger, eh? Hehehh heh....”</p>\n<p>Yulong was someone Shira heartily respected. He always used polite language when talking to the butler. Because of that he was irked by the way Good-Natured Spirit sneered.</p>\n<p>“I need to sell the painting you rejected before the market becomes too crowdy. Let’s go,” he said. Bantering with Good-Natured Spirit would only make him more cocky, so Shira held the urge to humor his annoying behavior and headed off to the village’s market.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Back in the kitchen, Mila stayed with his father--who still shredding coconuts--while she read from a see-through board in front of her.</p>\n<p>“Ugh… his experience didn’t even change a single point,” Mila groaned.</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro too engrossed himself in coconut to realize what his daughter was doing just now. “You did a <b>Status Window</b> on him?”</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura nodded. Her face was sour though. “Look at this, old man. See what’s wrong with the number?”</p>\n<p>“Hah, his <b>Dodge Rating</b> getting crazier than before,” Shuro Yashura said with his fingers rubbing his moustache.</p>\n<p>“No! Look, father--his combat attributes, look closely! <b>Strength</b>, <b>Agility</b>, <b>Dexterity</b>! All of them pitifully underdeveloped. And look at the <b>Wisdom</b> attribute now!”</p>\n<p>“Ooh, his Wisdom’s pretty high. I knew his head’s pretty good. No wonder he could ponder the real meaning of shredded coconuts… he’s really a wise kid, after all.”</p>\n<p>“Please be serious, father. This is a serious matter.”</p>\n<p>“I’m serious,” Shuro the patriarch frowned. “And shredded coconut is a serious matter too!”</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura took a deep breath. Getting emotional over her father’s stupidity would only complicate the conversation.</p>\n<p>“Did you really hear the nickname they gave you...?” Mila asked him as she massaged her forehead. “It’s toothless Yashura. Toothless!”</p>\n<p>“Who said that?”</p>\n<p>“People.”</p>\n<p>“Fuck them people,” Shuro said. He never heard those old fogies calling him “toothless”, so he reckoned young'uns were the ones who came up with that. He sighed. For them to call this patriarch who always held the title of the best cook in Badril Village, those young people really didn’t have a good sense in them.</p>\n<p>“Because there’s Uncle Jhuro’s watching us from behind as a patriarch you can be toothless incompetent all you want, father, but--”</p>\n<p>“Oi, mind your words!”</p>\n<p>“--But!” Mila asserted despite her father started to pout after being called an incompetent, “but my generation is going to be harsh. No one as skilled and as strong as Uncle Jhuro appeared in the young’uns to be the guardian lion as our emblem is supposed to be.”</p>\n<p>“That is maybe but what are you trying to say here?”</p>\n<p>“What I’m saying is Shira can’t afford to be another toothless patriarch. You’re a support class, father, a <b>Specialist</b> like me. In our Badril Village history no matter how great your cooking is and no matter how wide our connections are if a conflict to arise a support class as a patriarch, nobody’d take us seriously--that is, unless another Unique Class who can afford to stay here in the village appears to scare them annoying people.”</p>\n<p>“Hoo, it seems you’ve been using your head a lot recently. That’s quite surprising.”</p>\n<p>Mila pursed her lips.</p>\n<p>“Unlike a certain carefree toothless patriarch, me and most family members concerned about Shira’s progress stuck as a Level 3 Novice. And what’s more, that girl Bhela Malikh--I don’t like what she did with her hair.”</p>\n<p>“Her hair?”</p>\n<p>“She cut her hair short. I confirmed it myself.”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro shook his head. He knew what his daughter was worrying about. “Girl, nephew Bhela has been away from the village and our dull way of thinking. She had been living with people in different cultures and customs these past two years. Maybe she cut her hair because she wants to follow fashion. Like that Aunty Yarly’s girl who suddenly has her lips red with lip balms, see? The young'uns are always doing it whenever foreigners come bringing their latest fads with them. You’re thinking too much.”</p>\n<p>“Why does everyone think Bhela Malikh is just some brainless girl who doesn’t know what she’s doing?” Mila Yashura frowned. “She’s smart, father. Even Shira knows she’s smart. You know what Shira said when I told him her fiancée has short hair now?--”</p>\n<p>She smirked.</p>\n<p>“--He said, ‘the engagement’s not going to work’.”</p>\n<p>“Bah! He’s been saying that shit for years!”</p>\n<p>“I know, I know!” Mila said. “But this time he’s serious. He said that with a punchable face as if he was saying ‘see, I told you’. His face looked punchable, I tell ya!”</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura was genuinely angry. This time, Patriarch Shuro Yashura didn’t immediately reply. He looked at his daughter, scratched his head, said, “So, in short, you worried about we can’t do nothing if Bhela is serious about cutting her hair to state her stance on her own engagement?”</p>\n<p>“Well, yeah! Of course I am. Only widows who cut hairs like that!”</p>\n<p>“You think it’s because she doesn’t like being paired with our Shira who is much weaker than her?”</p>\n<p>“Well, duh, old man, you’re still asking the obvious?”</p>\n<p>“Then don’t worry, look again at his status,” Shuro Yashura tossed back the status window back to his daughter. Its lifespan hasn't yet expired, so it was still showing Shira’s attributes and status as Level 3 Novice. “See what’s wrong in there?”</p>\n<p>Mila opened her mouth, “His combat attributes--”</p>\n<p>“No, look again!” Shuro cut off.</p>\n<p>Despite knitting her eyebrows, Mila still didn’t catch his father’s drift.</p>\n<p>Seeing his daughter had a hard time figuring it out, Shuro Yashura revealed, “His elemental affinity. See?”</p>\n<p>“It’s <b>Water</b> elemental affinity. It’s not that rare. What’s wrong with it?”</p>\n<p>“Well, he’s still a Novice. Getting a class still far away from him.”</p>\n<p>When a person reached the first barrier at Level 10 and got his class, there was a chance for him to aversed in one or more elementals and largely transformed, or perhaps even enhanced, the skills he would get from the class he acquired. Not everyone, but the chance was more than fifty-fifty. Aside from the rare ones, four base elementals that commonly appeared were <b>Fire</b>, <b>Wind</b>, <b>Lightning</b>, and <b>Water</b>--Mila wasn’t sure what so special for her cousin acquired an affinity over one of those base elementals.</p>\n<p>“Have you seen anyone with an elemental affinity in his Novice years?” her father asked.</p>\n<p>“It’s rare…” Mila was unsure, “can’t say I have.”</p>\n<p>“You haven’t. I have,” Shuro Yashura said. “Twenty seven years ago. Your Uncle Jhuro had a huge fight with grandfather and he ran away into the Mossy Forest behind the mountain--for nearly three weeks. He ate wild fruits. He ate monster meat also. But in the last three days he got unlucky and got poisoned by a snake monster ten levels above him. He struggled with death. Alone in that forest. But he lived. The fool then decided the forest was too dangerous for him and he returned back home.”--and got to experience a near-death situation again after their furious father almost pummeled him to pulp, Patriarch Shuro’s memories drifted.</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura listened. She knew the story of how his uncle survived alone in Mossy Forest--it was crazy, a kind of legend for the young’uns today. That was the first story amongst stories about the Badril Village’s last Unique Class warrior--Jhuro Yashura the Blackfang Swordsman--the story that first made him famous in the village for his unordinary bravery and recklessness.</p>\n<p>Shuro Yashura asked her daughter, “You know what happened after that, right?”</p>\n<p>She nodded.</p>\n<p>“Uncle awakened his rare <b>Poison</b> elemental affinity.”</p>\n<p>And Jhuro Yashura wasn’t even reached Level 10 back then.</p>\n<p>There was an unspoken law of the system most people didn’t know. A premonition, or sign, more appropriately, that if a Novice got an elemental before acquiring a class, chance was, an Unique class would be waiting for him.</p>\n<p>“See what I’m getting at?” Shuro Yashura said with a smile. “Time will reveal it, you don’t have to worry. Sooner or later, there’ll be another Unique class in our Yashura Family.”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>That morning the family getting busy preparing for ngajen ceremony; family officials, the servants, even brats too, were busy with their own errands. Usually with a few of copper kobe coins older kids could secretly pass their morning errands to the little ones--as lazier and richer kids like Shira wasn’t foreign to the practice, but unfortunately he couldn’t find some kids to bribe even on days like this. Not that he wasn’t happy about it. The errand his aunt gave him accidentally had something to do in the market, the destination he’d go to sell his painting today anyway.</p>\n<p>“Is it me or someone’s been staring at me since I stepped out of my family’s gate?”</p>\n<p>“It’s not you,” Good-Natured Spirit replied to Shira's question. “It seems the stalker Big-Boobed Sect sent today was particularly sloopy, kinda annoying.”</p>\n<p>“Oh yeah? How many of them are following me?” Shira asked half-heartedly.</p>\n<p>“What? You don’t believe them Big-Boobed Sect always spying on us?”</p>\n<p>Shira shrugged. Good-Natured Spirit was right--the boy didn’t believe his ramblings about all-girl sect always hiding in Badril Village’s shadows, especially with those padded words about them being beautiful and having bountiful bodies. He didn’t believe it because he still got some common sense. Not to mention hidden sects, even some decent clans and schools wouldn’t bother with ordinary places like Badril Village.</p>\n<p>And thus as he had feared, the market was already crowded by then. The moment Shira realized it, Good-Natured Spirit already drifted away by the sight of excitement in gambling dens and beautiful young wives from Elzhier Family sold street foods. As it turned out, it was stamped on the Nalaq’s mind to get off Shira as soon as they came to the market lest the boy’d use him for errands one way or another. The peddler Shira acquainted with was getting a good crowd as he laid his wares behind his wagon.</p>\n<p>“Monkey!”</p>\n<p>The peddler behind the wares turned his head. He had a funny face, a rare trait that made him resemble a monkey. And there was no coincidence everyone called him Monkey. When Monkey slightly wandered his eyes through the crowd and saw Shira, he waved his hands to the grunting customers and told them he’d close his shop for a while.</p>\n<p>“Well, well, isn’t this our Young Master Shira blessing us with his presence?” the smiling Monkey briskly approached as he rubbed his palms excitedly. “Can I help you young master?”</p>\n<p>Shira stepped back when Monkey got too close. “Monkey, you better stop being creepy whenever I come visit you.”</p>\n<p>“You hurt me, young master. There’s nothing creepy about our business relationship.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, it’s your face. Don’t make me regret selling my painting to you.”</p>\n<p>“Haha, surely you jest, Young Master Shira--I’m trying my best to maintain a professional face from now on!” Monkey said that then immediately took a small peek at the content. “Your skill is just getting better and better, master. I’m sure this will sell well, Master!”</p>\n<p>“What’s with the master thing?”</p>\n<p>“How dare for me to call you ‘Young Master’ while you yourself are already an expert at this stage?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t want our relationship getting creepier than it already is,” Shira said, then he took out a pouch of coins. “Anyways, I got an errand from my aunt, so give me the thirteen dried spices worth all this money.”</p>\n<p>“What kind of spice?”</p>\n<p>“All kinds of spices.”</p>\n<p>“Of course, of course, I’ll give you a discount, just to celebrate your improvement in the path of drawing, Master.”</p>\n<p>By the time Shira got himself a basketful of spices, Monkey’s grin getting more annoying. The stereotypical fat and slimy merchants looked innocent compared to him. After Shira threw a frowning glance at him, he <em>reluctantly</em> admitted, “Young master may not know this, but recently I’ve got an Alchemist partner with me who was trying to be independent from his family,” he said. “And I must tell you, young master, this family is a many-hundreds of years Alchemists family, and you also must know he’s not kicked out of incompetente--”</p>\n<p>Shira cut his roundabout pitching. “You want me to back the Alchemist?”</p>\n<p>“Mmm...yes….” Monkey nodded with a wry smile.</p>\n<p>The boy’s eyes wandered through the peddler’s wares before looked at him in the eyes. “Even I must tread through the game of cat and dog with the elders because of the rules,” he explained to Monkey, who in turn, could only smile helplessly.</p>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>Mossack’s custom dictates children who haven’t gone through their coming of age ceremony--usually at the age of sixteen--to not being involved in politics and commerce. This is the reason why Shira--as he mostly acquired money winning through streaks of chess games with Good-Natured Spirit--couldn’t recklessly flaunt his personal wealth in public.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>The risk of having a relationship gone sour with this young master, Monkey knew that. It was unlikely for an upstart peddler to be relied on by a future patriarch of a big family, and he wholeheartedly believed it was unwise to create a trivial misunderstanding with Young Master Shira Yashura. After all, it was only one year until Shira would have his own coming of age ceremony. Therefore, Monkey didn’t want to impose on the Young Master’s kindness too much and quickly changed the topic with something he’d prepared beforehand.</p>\n<p>“This is a <b>Boost Elixir</b> concocted by my partner. He might not a 2nd-Tier Alchemist yet but I assure you, Young Master Shira, the elixir’s potent power won’t lose against any experts you’ll find anywhere!” Monkey said with his over-excited sales pitch, which made him look more funny than usual, “This humble bottle was scientifically proven to increase a person’s level as long as he is below the age of twenty! To date, this Boost Elixir has 100% effectiveness in increasing the user’s level! Young master, you are very lucky--you can have this miraculous elixir just for half of the original price today!”</p>\n<p>Though it was clear Monkey meant no harm, Shira narrowed his eyes at the pedder.</p>\n<p>“Did someone pay you to make me drink it?” he asked suspiciously.</p>\n<p>“You jest again, Young Master… ha ha… haaa….” Monkey awkwardly laughed as he tried to hide his dampened enthusiasm. “Why don’t you try it first, Young Master Shira. You don’t have to pay if you didn’t get to graduate from Level 3 Novice.”</p>\n<p>Eventually, Shira drank the Boost Elixir within a gulp, not because he believed its miraculous effect, but because he was weak for free and discounted goods.</p>\n<p>“Your EXP bar didn’t even budge a little,” Monkey muttered with a meek voice.</p>\n<p>“The liquid is surprisingly well made though. Is this really made by someone you know?”</p>\n<p>“I said before, Young Master. The one who made this hailed from an old Alchemist family that even outside South Tiramikal Kingdom their last name still can be a pretty big deal. I’m pretty confident that--normally--this elixir will have a 100% success rate for leveling up whoever drinks it!”</p>\n<p>“Such a confident boast. Are you perhaps implying that my case is not <em>normally</em>?”</p>\n<p>“He hehe, you surely joke. You know that I don’t mean any harm, young master.”</p>\n<p>Shira of course knew it. And the other thing he also knew, that if it was a really impressive elixir he just drank by now, the usual Monkey wouldn’t utter a single phrase of the word “free”, regardless how many times the elixir failed to deliver its promise.</p>\n<p>Shira looked at Monkey suspiciously, “You’re Monkey, aren’t you? Not someone brainwashed by my family’s enemy or something like that? You know, by vampires.”</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira… now your joke is not even funny--something like a poor peddler to be brainwashed only appears in stories. Vampires are some unfounded folklore.”</p>\n<p>“Monkey I know is stupid. If not brainwashed, then he definitely manipulated to sell a fake elixir to someone from big families.”</p>\n<p>Before Monkey was able to retort that, a cold voice came from the wagon. “Young Master Yashura, I don’t mind if you pinpoint Monkey’s stupidity and make assumptions about him muchever you want. But to call my elixir is fake, I can’t stand and watch around anymore.”</p>\n<p>A man appeared from the wagon Monkey had, had an appearance of the stereotypical scholar Shira had in mind--though, by the way he crossed his arms pompously, he seemed to have a pride worthy of someone hailed from big families.</p>\n<p>“You’re the Alchemist?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, you call me Snake--don’t ask for my real name,” the Alchemist said.</p>\n<p>One would hide his name if he didn’t want to be associated with his family anymore. So Shira didn’t ask. He looked at the scholarly Alchemist, then at the peddler. One was the Snake and the other one was the Monkey.</p>\n<p>Shira found some sort of strange camradice between them. “I see, so both of you decided to be a partner for life.”</p>\n<p>“Not for life, no. Spare me. It’s better for me to ditch this stupid ape as soon as he outlives his usefulness.”</p>\n<p>“Heey! Don’t say ditching in front of me!” Monkey protested. Snake ignored him without pretense, making the impression that this scene was ordinary for them.</p>\n<p>Shira then asked Snake straightforwardly.</p>\n<p>“What kind of elixir is this?”</p>\n<p>“Didn’t Monkey tell you? A Boost Elixir. My latest masterpiece,” Snake replied.</p>\n<p>“You’re aware that your partner tried to sell your masterpiece at a half price, right? I don’t even have to pay, it was what he said before.”</p>\n<p>“It was my idea,” Snake said. “This is a simple business hack. I’m confident about my concoctions. After all, I experimented heavily on human anatomy--too heavy, even, to the point folks in my family want me gone for good. I’ve got nothing to lose here. That bottle is a prototype; it cost a lot so I planned to price it a lot.”</p>\n<p>“You want to use my bad reputation as a stepping stone, don’t you?” Shira asked with a sour smile.</p>\n<p>“Yes. Do you mind?”</p>\n<p>“No, I’d gladly make profit out of those trash talking they did behind my back--though, it seems you picked the wrong guinea pig to be your mascot for your ‘business hack’,” Shira said with a wry smile.</p>\n<p>Monkey nodded weakly. As a peddler from outside the village, he was always bothered by how nasty rumors could be, especially with some acquaintance he depended on sometimes as an important business partner.</p>\n<p>Seeing that they no longer had things to chat about, Shira said to them he’d consider putting some resources if he managed to gain some nod from the family elders after he went through the coming-of-age ceremony next year. And now that he finished selling Good-Natured Spirit’s rejected commision and completed the errand his aunt gave him, Shira then bid farewell to the two animal-nicknamed gentlemen.</p>\n<p>“Please wait, Young Master Shira.”</p>\n<p>Shira turned back his head again and found Snake, the one who called him, ran back to Monkey’s wagon to grab something.</p>\n<p>“Try to drink this one,” Snake said after trotting back hurriedly. “It’s alright, you don’t have to pay for this time too.”</p>\n<p>The current elixir Snake took out was the exact opposite from the previous one. Its container was beautiful and high-class, but the content was muddy and very low in quality. Hearing that this one was also free, Shira didn’t hesitate to drink it.</p>\n<p>The after taste was incredibly sour. Unlike any other bitter concocted elixirs or potions he ever drank. Although not much, Shira could feel his body warming up. He was surprised at the unexpected reaction.</p>\n<p>“Oohhhh!!!” Monkey cried as his eyes glued at Shira’s Status Window. “The EXP bar moved!”</p>\n<p>“What?” the surprised Shira glanced at Snake and asked slowly, “This one’s free, right?”</p>\n<p>It was in a single flash Shira did catch a strange dumbfoundedness in Snake eyes, like the result even came more shocking than him than either of Shira and Monkey. Yet the moment after he promptly regained his stoic exposure, then said to Shira, “Don’t worry, I don’t plan to take back my words,”</p>\n<p>The odd Alchemist put his hands at his back and walked back to his wagon. Before he climbed the wagon, he once again glanced at Shira, looking in a state of half-disbelief like expression</p>\n<p>As Snake disappeared into the wagon, Shira and Monkey exchanged glances.</p>\n<p>“He still has that kind of face even though he promises it to be free? You sure do have an odd friend.” Shira said.</p>\n<p>Monkey grinned. “Though an oddball, I never seen anyone with more talent in alchemy than him, like, ever.”</p>\n<p>After leaving Monkey to continue his stall, Shira saw Good-Natured Spirit again when he visited a food stall not far from Monkey’s wagon. He asked what he was doing, and the Nalaq told him there was a fool who bet a lot and won a lot in the gambling games. To lose against in gambling against someone with Good-Natured Spirit’s caliber, really--Shira sighed--he couldn’t wait for his coming-of-age ceremony next year so he too could farm on these gullible people in some friendly matches--just like what he did with Good-Natured Spirit for this past one year.</p>\n<p>“You know,” munching on some satays he bought from the market, Shira muttered when he headed home along with Good-Natured Spirit, “just then I drank this elixir that really could boost my EXP a little. I don’t know how the guy concocts it, but I have the feeling that I just drink some very expensive elixir for free.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, yeah?”</p>\n<p>On the way back to Yashura Family Shira told the Nalaq spirit about the Alchemist and his elixirs. He also told him that his status that usually wouldn’t react to normal elixirs this time moved a bit after he drank a strange low-quality elixir.</p>\n<p>“That Alchemist must be a nerd to be that sharp,” Good-Natured Spirit said as he floated lazily beside the boy.</p>\n<p>“He looks like that too. The peddler he partnered with also has some good sense in him. So I thought it’s not a loss for me to use all those foreign coins I got from you to invest on them for the next year.”</p>\n<p>“Hmm,” Good-Natured Spirit crossed his arms. “I think you should be worried.”</p>\n<p>“Worried? Why?”</p>\n<p>“You said that nerd Alchemist was the one who pushed that low-quality elixir to you, right?”</p>\n<p>“I got to drink that for free,” Shira emphasized.</p>\n<p>“He realized one little secret about you then,” Good-Natured Spirit said.</p>\n<p>Shira stopped walking. He looked at him with his head tilted.</p>\n<p>“What secret?”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit who floated before, spoke again.</p>\n<p>“You shouldn’t worry about it too much for now, brat. But, I advise you, if you are still holding dear for your lazy, peaceful village life, you should turn back and kill him right now.”</p>\n<hr>\n","unregistered":[]},"novels/yashura-legacy/contents/volume-1/chapter-3.md":{"contributions":{},"lastModified":1605167953367,"data":{"title":"Ngajen Ceremony","author":"Kaboom"},"body":"<p>What the Nalaq told Shira lingered in his mind. Good-Natured Spirit blurted something about killing someone as if it was something trivial that could popped out easily in normal conversation. To kill someone after finding out his secret--what kind of secret he needed to protect anyway? A secret he never wanted people to know the fact he was drawing semi-porns for money. But he wasn’t that insecure to kill someone over a petty secret like that? That would be him being not right in the head. The more he thought about Good-Natured Spirit’s remark, the more it disturbed him. Especially right now, when his hands painted in red, bathed in blood. When he just did an act of actual killing.</p>\n<p>“Something on your mind, Young Master Shira?” a rough voice disturbed his train of thought.</p>\n<p>“Ah,” Shira looked at a burly man, an experienced hunter, who called him.</p>\n<p>The man’s body even drenched in thicker blood than him. One would get easily nauseated by the sight of it. Yet it didn’t make the boy flinched, as he was expecting the experience for a few months already.</p>\n<p>“Here. Look at his gut. Spilling out his innards with your own hands might be a good experience for you, young master.”</p>\n<p>The hunter spun a sharp dagger, holding it by the tip of its blade, having a gesture of offering it to his young master.</p>\n<p>“Is that okay? I even had trouble when skinning the hide,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>He’d rather not, to be honest, since splitting a goat’s gut could be messy if he did it crudely. Even if he was the young master of the family, when messing with the raw meat, not even his uncle could save him from the aunties’ nagging. Shira Yashura was nearly sixteen, almost reaching adulthood, so he had to participate in butchering goats; it was a quite tasking task, but was easy enough compared to butchering cows he had to do in a few years. But for the fifteen years old young master, getting the hang of the butchering knife’s handle was plenty of experience already for him.</p>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>As the custom dictates, every month in ngajen ceremony preparation, the boys will have to deal with cows and goats while the girls help aunties plucking chickens’ and ducks’ feathers. Whether the gatekeepers' children or the family’s next heirs, all of them are required to do it every time a major ceremony approaches.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>After doing his part in butchering a goat Shira immediately took a bath to remove the bloody pungent. On a whim he then strolled to the kitchen to grab some snacks. There he witnessed how all the coconuts he and his uncle shred already transformed into delicious foods; rendang, Bulayak satay, coconut satay, spicy curry, many other mouth drolling coconut cuisines. The coconut loving uncle was all smiles and gave him a big portion of the famous beef cuisine the locals called rendang--which, normally, even for a young master like Shira would get to eat rendang once every few months. But with enough wit and experience in currying favor with his uncle, he got to taste those delicious food handed down by his uncle, the Chief Chef, personally.</p>\n<p>“Shira my boy,” Patriarch Shuro said to his nephew who was squatting below the shadow of a thick pillar, happily munching on his rendang, “you’re going to visit Malikh Family tonight. Keep a good check on your cousin. Don’t embarrass Yashura Family and present our rendang_ _for their main family.”</p>\n<p>“Sure.”</p>\n<hr>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>Domesticated cows were less in numbers than goats in Badril Village, so meals from cows, not including the innards which could be made into popular but cheap cuisines, like only served for village big shots or important visitors during the ngajen ceremony.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>Laughters and chatters made the night more merry than any other thay of the month. It was brighter than usual, as villagers came out of their house to set up big braziers to light the road between the families that were holding festives. From one hundred meters away, through the thick wall of the big families, the mouth-watering aroma of prepared food wafted through the air as if they informally invited people to come and to taste the delicacy these big families had. The change in scenery upon the arrival of the night signaled the nigh of Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>Yashura Family, the oldest family around, was known to have the best food amongst all families in Badril Village, while Elzhier Family known as the family that always threw the biggest party post-ceremony--Elzhier Family’s maidservants were beautiful and they’d show off their voluptuous bodies every single ngajen ceremony. Particularly this month however, everyone was anticipating the ceremony thrown by Malikh Family; for two years since the young lady’s absence they threw nothing more than mediocre festivities, her return was to be seen as their revival on the village’s political stage. And from how big their arrangement looked like, it seemed Malikh Family didn’t plan to fail everyone’s expectations.</p>\n<p>Shira Yashura wore the same suit he got from his uncle on his fifteenth birthday. It was the usual suit he’d wear whenever a ceremony was held. His uncle bought it from a merchant who had connections outside the kingdom, which was pretty good since the fabric wasn’t stiff, but could get unbearably itchy in places he didn’t want to scratch whenever there were people around. The obvious part missing from the wears his peers were wearing was beast pelts.</p>\n<p>Pelts from ferocious beasts were known for irrefutable proof for boys’ courage and manliness. As many young gentlemen of Badril Village wore on their necks, always looking for the opportunity to show off the trophy of their preys to girls--which translated as fashionable fads for boys who wanted to get laids.</p>\n<p>Of course, Shira, as part of the dull and no-nonsense camp of the boys in Badril Village, never had participated in that kind of indecent business. He was so dull that the only girl who would accompany him to attend ceremonies was his cousin Mila--who, even though her face was quite pretty, also happened to be in terrible luck for romance.</p>\n<p>“No matter how many times I see it, it’s always impressive to see how fast you wrap all these banana leaves,” Shira commented as he watched how Mila wrapped rendang with banana leaves. She was very good at it, comparable to the aunties’ skills that had been forged day and night in the family’s kitchen.</p>\n<p>“You talking? You’ve done your training with the family's sword technique, I assume?” Mila said with her lips pouted. Shira thought it was unusual for Mila didn’t nag her mouth off immediately when she saw him. He saw a sword wrapped in cloth near Mila. His face immediately twisted in a troubled look.</p>\n<p>“I won’t bring that thing,” he protested.</p>\n<p>“You--” Mila hissed.</p>\n<p>“What should I do with a sword inside another family’s ceremony?” Shira said. The sword was his father’s, and that was his reason he didn’t want to use it. “Look, I can only draw the blade from the sheath at most. Without a proper amount of Strength attribute I can’t swing this properly. It rejects my mana. I’d make a fool out of myself if that happened.”</p>\n<p>“That’s because you were stupidly increasing your Wisdom instead of, that’s why you--arghh! Just forget about it! I know you’re trying to make excuses! Since you’re so weak all we can do is flaunting around your father’s reputation. We’ve got to remind people that our Yashura Family’s not to mess with. Here, just slip this fucking sword in your belt.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, this is embarrassing. Those rumors are about to get worse tonight,” Shira said with a sigh. His reputation as a trash talent was annoying enough, added this shameless act of throwing his weight around, he’d become more reluctant to show his face in the public later on. But still he unwillingly slipped the sword in his belt.</p>\n<p>Mila snorted. She ignored the complaint. Right now she could care less about the rumors about her cousin. What she had to prioritize tonight was the bad premonition she had about Bhela Malikh’s short hair--nobody believed her when she said that Bhela was being a slut for cutting her hair short in spite of her being in an engagement. While her hands craftly knotted the rendang wrapped in banana leaves with a rope made with dried coconut leaves, she suddenly had a cold smile; the image of those impudent Malikhs shuddering under the famous sword of Yashura Family’s Unique Class, Jhuro Yashura the Blackfang Swordsman, entertained her she began to chuckle coldly.</p>\n<p>“Huhuhu… just you wait you bitch…”</p>\n<p>Shira stepped back. He had the hunch he should keep a distance away from his current cousin right now.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Every month, for every family in Badril Village, cooking during the Ngajen Ceremony was always a time rushing hectic. Even more in Malikh Family this time. Since the amount of food they had to deliver before the ceremony started more than twice the amount they made last month, most of the aunties in duty were cooking outdoors. The smoke from the half-dried firewood would be too unbearable for the eyes if all of them cooked in one cramped place. Fortunately, most of the dishes were already cooked and sent to the courtyard, so the only people who were still on duty preparing food were a small number of aunties and maidservants.</p>\n<p>The young maidservants were pale from tiredness but they couldn’t afford to slack in this one Ngajen Ceremony. The usual noisy aunties, they didn’t even show a sign of wanting to rest. Nobody could beat the resilience of the kitchen-duty armies when it came to preparing for a loadful of party’s foods.</p>\n<p>Usually, the one who would supervise these spartan cooking aunties would be the patriarch’s wife, Bhela’s mother. It was already a long-held tradition in the village for the patriarch to cook for the family’s important guests as the Chief Chef, while the wife supported him by supervising the aunties and maidservants. In Ngajen Ceremony this month, however, Bhela’s mother holed herself to accompany the husband on his ill-bed.</p>\n<p>She was not in the mood to meet with people. So Bhela stepped in to fill her position.</p>\n<p>Back when she was little Bhela often followed her mother working during the ngajen ceremony, she knew what she had to do by the back of her hand. In usage of salt, for example, she knew down to the tiniest detail of how much salt should be applied to different kinds of cuisines. She also instructed the inexperienced maidservants who were in charge of cooking side dishes so the overall quality of the feast would be balanced. Bhela Malikh didn’t betray everyone’s expectations about her. She did her work splendidly.</p>\n<p>However, there was a matter she saw that didn’t make her happy. The largest furnace that was usually reserved for the Chief Chef, today was used by an old man from the outer family. A great cook, the old man was. Known for his vast experience in handling the family’s food stalls for years. The problem was his common status. Without at least an elder status made it awkward for him to cook as the Chief Chef in this kitchen, even if he was a mere proxy. Bhela wondered whether the one who took the charge when her parents were unavailable knew the risk of being laughed at and criticized by the other two big families--especially now that the relationship between Yashura and Malikh wasn’t that good like before.</p>\n<p>“Young lady, the day’s getting dark, you should take a bath now and prepare yourself for the ceremony,” an aunty said to Bhela.</p>\n<p>“Yes, young lady is no longer a little girl, so making you pretty will take a while,” an early twenty maidservant added from the side. She continued, “The new girls should be able to complete the foods since you directed them a lot. Please don’t worry about us.”</p>\n<p>“I’m relieved to hear that,” Bhela said. Not yet three seconds later her eyes wandered to the old cook again. She couldn’t hide her frown.</p>\n<p>“Something the matter, Young Lady Bhela?”</p>\n<p>“Yes. Maybe it’s a misunderstanding on my part but… I can’t see the elder who would substitute my father as the Chief Chef.”</p>\n<p>Hearing Bhela said her concern, the aunties and the maidservants averted eyes with their young lady with troubled faces. Bhela then understood there was something shady going on.</p>\n<p>Her suspicion turned worse when she saw a young man in his twenties leading four manservants with him. When the aunties were working in the kitchen, it was an unspoken rule for unrelated adult men not to approach, but the battle-hardened aunties that normally were ferocious in defending their territories were all silent in welcoming the cocky visitors. It wasn’t surprising to Bhela that all of them came from Elder Jhamil’s faction.</p>\n<p>“Why aren’t you ready yet, old worm?!”</p>\n<p>“I am sorry, young elder… some dish cannot be rushed so I prepared some to--”</p>\n<p><em>Slap!!</em></p>\n<p>The slapping sound echoed in the kitchen. The room descended into a dead silent. The old cook was trembling; he lowered his head and covered the cheek that just got slapped but everyone could see the blood on the corner of his mouth. Bhela recollected her memory, and finally remembered the arrogant young man was actually Elder Jhamil’s own son.</p>\n<p>“Shit!” Elder Jhamil’s son swore, “those councils from Village Hall came. We must complete the set before too long! Those people are the ones who usually have the heaviest voice when valuing Ngajen Ceremony dishes!”</p>\n<p>One follower quipped, “Young elder is right. This old worm can’t cook shit! If this goes on, the only things the Village Hall council will remember about Elder Jhamil’s cooking is that we Malikhs cook as slow as snail!”</p>\n<p>The frown on Bhela’s face became deeper. Young elder? Before she went out for the seminars that lasted two years, this man, son of Elder Jhamil, merely a family member with a post within the family’s business. And something else that disturbed her was how she couldn’t see how the blurted about Elder Jhamil’s cooking, the one who worked in the kitchen all day, didn’t see the said elder even once today.</p>\n<p>Bhela still held her silent. But her eyes were cold and sharp judging people and the situation. The aunties and the maidservants, though they looked sympathetic with the old man, were afraid to go against Elder Jhamil’s son. Maybe because the lack of resistance Elder Jhamil’s son dared to do a taboo known in the kitchen--swapping food that wrapped in banana leaves with ceramic plates, garnished a bit, and called it the Chief Chef’s cuisine.</p>\n<p>“No, young elder!” a brave middle-aged aunty stepped forward, “you can’t do that!”</p>\n<p>“Why not?” one follower sneered in Elder Jhamil’s son’s place. “This one also got beef, isn’t it? We need to quickly serve the Chief Chef cuisine to the people from Village Hall councils.”</p>\n<p>“Exactly because they are from the Village Hall council--just from inferior cuts of the beef they’d know the dishes have been swapped! You’ll tarnish Malikh Family’s honor if people knew you were fooling--”</p>\n<p>“Fooling?!” Elder Jhamil roared.</p>\n<p>The young elder raised his hand, though the aunty who complained quickly hid back behind the maidservants. Elder Jhamil’s son then rampaged into a series of barking, yelling and threatening the aunties to cut their salary just because his mood was spoiled.</p>\n<p>His words scared all the girls and the women inside the kitchen. All except Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>After they were done swapping the foods, the young elder led his men out of the kitchen with great swagger. The young elder stopped at the door, turned around, and gave the old cook one last ultimatum: “There’ll be a noble in the ceremony so we need rendang for the main course. So go make it, old worm. You know what’s gonna happen if you couldn’t deliver, don’t you?”</p>\n<p>The old man trembled. Even the eyes on the aunties couldn’t help but shake at the threat. There was now way they could prepare rendang with only two hours remaining until the Ngajen Ceremony started.</p>\n<p>After that situation calmed down. The aunties and the maidservants went back to work. Some of them still exchanged whispered and gossiped amongst themselves. But when Bhela approached, immediately they stopped and pretended nothing happened.</p>\n<p>“Young lady…” a pudgy aunty came to her, the one who stood up against the young elder from before.</p>\n<p>“Aunty?”</p>\n<p>“We are sorry… we’ve had no meaning to show you that embarrassing scene.”</p>\n<p>Bhela shook her head. “No, I’m one from the main family bloodline; I should've been the one who stood up to him instead of hiding behind everyone.”</p>\n<p>The aunty knew the young lady didn’t say a word before because the girl wanted to know the situation. Some other middle-aged aunties who were close with Madam Malikh also knew more or less Bhela’s detached wait-and-see attitude, so no one really would blame her even if she didn’t say a word before--especially since she had just returned from overseas. The pudgy aunty tugged on Bhela’s sleeve, whispered to her ear, “Young Lady Bhela, we know you’re concerned. But we’ve already gotten used to it. You’re still young. Your future is brighter than everyone else in the family, Young Lady Bhela. It’s better to endure than pointlessly making enemies.”</p>\n<p>“This isn’t pointless,” Bhela said. She then grabbed the nearest apron and wore it. Her father was the patriarch. And she wasn’t a poster girl to draw everyone’s attention to the family.</p>\n<p>The pudgy aunty wanted to say something again. But words stuck on her throat, she closed her mouth as soon as she opened it.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the old man began to pick some mature coconut and shredded it listlessly. He got more than four decades of handling food stalls for Malikh Family, he wasn’t a stranger at cooking rendang. But he already gave up on finishing one for tonight’s Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>“Uncle, I’ll take it from here,” Bhela said as she approached the weary old man.</p>\n<p>“Ahh, yes?” the old man was started. The girl came with an apron and common garment, had fair and beautiful skin, as well clear and articulate voice; a maidservant from the inner family was the first one that came to his mind. But only when he noticed even the aunties were respectful to her and her striking bob-cut short hair that the old man began drenched in cold sweat.</p>\n<p>“I said, uncle,” Bhela repeated, “I’ll take it from here. You can rest now.”</p>\n<p>The old man vigorously shook his head.</p>\n<p>“Please Young Lady Bhela… please spare this old bone….”</p>\n<p>“This is originally my father’s post, uncle. You’ll have to be at least an elder and write your name in council’s ledger to be a substitute for my father.”</p>\n<p>The old man wanted to break into a tearless cry. This is worse than when he faced Elder Jhamil’s son's harassment before. The most thing he was afraid of was the news of Elder Jhamil using him as Chief Chef behind the scene to reach the ears of the main family. And now that Bhela Malikh was here, there was nothing he could do but to resign his life to fate.</p>\n<p>“Y-young lady!” a maidservant yelled, “you can’t!”</p>\n<p>“Who says I can’t?” Bhela asked sharply.</p>\n<p>An aunty, who had a stern-looking face, said, “You can’t cook for the main course, young lady. In case of a patriarch's absence, usually one of the elders who’s going to take his place. There’s no rule saying it’s okay for women to do it.”</p>\n<p>“Then, I’m going to ask,” from the aunty, Bhela threw her glance toward the old man, “are you an elder cooking here to substitute my father as a cook, uncle?”</p>\n<p>The old man’s face turned pale. Whichever the answer of that question would lead him to the road of punishment. All of the sudden, he became a mute.</p>\n<p>Because she had the most standing, nobody made a sound when Young Lady Bhela Malikh asked them to fetch chickens and spices for her.</p>\n<p>Not long after, the story about how the Young Lady of Malikh Family wanted to substitute her father spread like a wildfire. Never in Badril Village’s history would a young lady do that. A crowd of curious males, mostly the youngsters from main and outer of Malikh Family, surrounded the kitchen as they wanted to catch a glimpse of how their beautiful young lady recklessly challenged the custom by her own. The boys sighed in admiration. Bhela Malikh was essentially an Archer at heart. But the way she handled a blade, even if it was a kitchen knife, was skillful and graceful, as every time her slim wrist stopped moving from cutting down a vegetable, a wave of gulping could be heard. The boys couldn’t take their eyes from her. The reckless and brave young lady was simply too charming.</p>\n<p>“Did you know that foreigners often confuse rendang as dried curry?” Bhela said to one maidservant who stared at the way she cooked. “Curry leaves originated from an area close to western Haldeen lands, so many local Mossacks sailed the sea to try their luck making it big working for western empires.”</p>\n<p>The usual aloof Bhela unusually was talkative when she was cooking, which was quite a big surprise for people who were watching. She explained to the clueless maidservants how, during her two years travelling in seminars from countries to countries, found many noble owned restaurants claimed to serve rendang but turned out to be dried curry. All the while sharply focused on doing her cooking duty.</p>\n<p>“Young lady!” from the crowd came out an angry bald man. He was Elder Jhamil. “W-what are you doing there?”</p>\n<p>“I’m cooking,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“But you can’t work there!” Elder Jhamil yelled. “No woman can substitute for patriarch! That’s against the rule!”</p>\n<p>“I don’t recall we have a rule like that.”</p>\n<p>“If you know why you still stand there?”</p>\n<p>“Neither do I recall a rule for an elder to use a stand-in for the Chief Chef position.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s face turned weird as if he suddenly got constipated. Many of the youngsters didn’t catch Bhela’s remarks nor they cared too much about it, but some in the crowd were nodding knowingly, as many of them were familiar with how shady Elder Jhamil was doing things.</p>\n<p>As the bald elder’s head was racing fast looking for an answer to defuse the young lady’s claim, suddenly, a loud roar exploded behind him.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela, who do you think you are? Just because your father is the family’s patriarch you think you can do whatever you want?!”</p>\n<p>The faces of aunties and the maidservants twitched. They witnessed how the young elder harassed the old man before, so they were itching to throw back the same question at him instead, though no more brave aunties dared to cause more troubles.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s son continued, “The ingredient for making Chief dishes takes money, young lady. Not even the patriarch himself has the daring to use coins from the treasury for himself. Do you want to embarrass your parents that much?”</p>\n<p>“I’m not making this food for myself nor I cook for my father. It’s for the guests. And I provided the spices and the foreign curry leaves by myself,” Bhela said. Some maidservants behind her nodded nervously as Bhela indeed ordered them to fetch spices from the personal kitchen in the main family’s residential area.</p>\n<p>In spite of that, the young elder kept pushing on with nasty smile on his face.</p>\n<p>“What about the chicken, young lady? They cost money! What do you say about that, huh?”</p>\n<p>Behind Bhela, the aunties, even the maidservants, were whispering at each other on how ridiculous it was to question the sole young generation of Malikh Family main bloodline over some chickens. Even Bhela, the young lady in question, would only glanced at the troubled expression of Elder Jhamil.</p>\n<p>“I will pay for the chicken,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Ha? Pay? With what? Your father’s money? Can’t a sick person even pay the cost of the foods for ngajen ceremony all by himself?”</p>\n<p>“No need to bring my father’s name here.” Bhela said with a dangerously cold tone.</p>\n<p>The chillness in her eyes was telling that she really did hate people bringing her parents’ name in bad faith. After hearing gasps of surprise from people that didn’t expect the usually silent young lady could utter something with such a biting tone, she sighed, said with an explanation, “I got a dress as a gift from a certain person who has too much money in his pocket. He said the dress is so valuable even the princesses wear them in parties. It should cover the cost of these chickens I’m going to cook if I sell the dress right here right now.”</p>\n<p>Bhela then tilted her head and glanced at the bald elder.</p>\n<p>“Am I right, Elder Jhamil?”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil wanted to maintain his smile, but his face went stiff as stone. He was trembling inside for knowing that the dress he acquired with a large sum of money and with his best connection, valued the same as some mere village chickens in Bhela’s eyes.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, his son, who was taken aback for a bit from the cold remark Bhela had said earlier, recovered, began to yell again, “Ha! Did you not train your brain when you were overseas, my young lady? The same dress princesses wear in parties? Only someone dumb believe that! Hah! Obviously you’ve been lied to! You’ve been crooked, young lady, crooked--”</p>\n<p><em>Paak!</em></p>\n<p>From behind, the already red-faced Elder Jhamil smacked his son’s head. “You’ve been rude to Young Lady Bhela, you dumbskull! You have to apologize! Young lady can’t bear to hear it anymore!”</p>\n<p>While in fact it was him who couldn’t bear to hear being called a crook.</p>\n<p>“Apologize!” Elder Jhamil roared.</p>\n<p><em>Splash!</em></p>\n<p>The pair father and son’s performance didn’t amuse Bhela, however. With the lid in her hand, Bhela scooped boiling curry broth and splashed it to their direction. Surprised, the stupid young elder swore with nasty words while his father cried in high-pitched voice.</p>\n<p>“Please get out,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil laughed wryly.</p>\n<p>“Please don’t be like that, young lady. I know my son doesn't have the best education but--”</p>\n<p><em>Splash!!</em></p>\n<p>Bhela waved the cooking lid once again as soon as Elder Jhamil stepped forward. The hot water splashed on his expensive boots. This time, while he didn’t expect for Bhela splashing hot water at him again, he wasn’t freaking out. It seemed his plan to make the young lady behave a little backfiring instead. His face turned solemn.</p>\n<p>“Young lady…”</p>\n<p>“I’m not going to say it thrice--everyone who has nothing to do in the kitchen, please get out,” Bhela said. “Or else--”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The major families’ lands were astonishingly spacious and complex, their walls were thick and tall, therefore each of them employed a few stationary guards for the main gate as gatekeepers. These gatekeepers, though usually filled by members of the outer part of the families, their duty were significantly more important than others since they represented the face of the family they served. So they always maintain polite gestures to everyone who came through their gate, either commoners or rich people from big families. Yet when Shira and Mila arrived the Malikh Family’s gatekeepers didn’t even hide their scoffs.</p>\n<p>“Ridiculous!” she hissed with a face boiled in anger, “even lowly gatekeepers are looking down on us!”</p>\n<p>“Don’t bother with them,” Shira said. Unlike his cousin’s furious temper, his flair seemed like he shrugged the blatant disrespect, as the holder of “Eternal Novice” title he was already numb by how people were talking behind his back.</p>\n<p>“If your father was here they’d bow their asses as soon as they saw us Yashura coming.”</p>\n<p>Shira shrugged his shoulders again.</p>\n<p>Still seething in anger, Mila cast her eyes on the banana leaves wrapped food in Shira’s hands. “Who should we give the rendang to?” she asked.</p>\n<p>“Let’s just give it to a random servant.” Then Shira called a maidservant who was carrying a tray full of food. “Excuse me!”</p>\n<p>“Yes? What can I help y--” The moment this maidservant turned her head and saw Shira’s face, she immediately threw back her eyes and escaped with hurried trot, pretending she saw nothing.</p>\n<p>“The fuck?!” Mila was flastergabbed, didn’t know what to say.</p>\n<p>Later on Shira and Mila realized how unpopular Yashura Family was to the current Malikhs, even the servants who usually held no voice in the family were avoiding the pair of cousins like plague. Their attitude especially worsened when it came to Shira Yashura.</p>\n<p>“Look there,” someone whispered amongst the guests, “Yashura Family send their eldest young miss and the young master! Out of all the Ngajen Ceremony, they choose tonight to show their faces--pretty obvious, eh? Bet they’re drooling to get another Unique Class after knowing our Young Lady Bhela’s real talent tonight!”</p>\n<p>Someone else agreed and replied, “With that kind of trash as their young master, they’d be dreamin’ to get even a touch of our Young Lady Bhela. Pueh!”</p>\n<p>Hearing the muffled disdain, Mila Yashura whirled her body, glaring people with eagle eyes. “Who said that?!” she growled.</p>\n<p>“Mila…” Shira held her shoulder.</p>\n<p>“The fuckers don’t even put our Yashura Family in their eyes. Just because shitty rumors about Unique Class they started to feel high and mighty, eh?”</p>\n<p>“Just let go, Uncle Shuro didn’t send us here to start troubles,” Shira said. “All we need to do is to show our faces here and give them our rendang. It’s not our problem whether they welcome our good intention with grace or not.”</p>\n<p>Though Shira said that, he secretly hoped Malikh Family would grow too proud to receive it--all so he had an excuse to keep his uncle’s rendang for himself.</p>\n<p>A commotion arose. People hussing here and there with excitement. When Shira and Mila wanted to know what was going on, a parade of beautiful young women glittering and stealing the whole show came from inside of Malikh Family’s hall. Leading them was a short-haired young beauty, face as icy as an ice sculpture, the recent name that everyone had been talking about these days, Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>It was clear from the way Bhela positioned herself she represented the family as the ceremony’s Chief Chef.</p>\n<p>“Whoa, so Malikh Family let her do that,” Shira murmured.</p>\n<p>Not to mention being the Chief Chef--the most Shira did in his family’s kitchen was helping his uncle, helping him shred coconuts. They were at the same age, but the same old Shira still practiced butchering goats while the supposed fiancée of his was climbing the social ladder. Even Mila was angry by the special treatment Malikh Family gave to their young lady.</p>\n<p>“Sup, young master!” from behind a voice called him.</p>\n<p>Shira turned around, found the one who greeted him was Monkey.</p>\n<p>“Who?” Mila asked Shira as the stranger with a monkey-like face approaching.</p>\n<p>“This one is called by the name of Monkey, young lady,” Monkey, with his self-trained Mossack’s style bowing gesture, introduced himself smoothly.</p>\n<p>Mila hummed in ackwnoledgement. It was harder to forget than remembering someone with such combination of face and awkward name.</p>\n<p>“Mister Monkey, I thought you’ll spend the ceremony to show Mister Snake around since he’s an outsider. What are you doing in Malikh Family?” Shira asked.</p>\n<p>“Now, now, please drop the ‘Mister’, young master. I’m not that old yet to be called as such,” Monkey said, then he continued explaining his story this evening. “We were planning to go to your family’s ceremony, young master. But who would have thought Snake to meet with his relatives here? His relatives are actually Malikh Family’s guests for tonight’s Ngajen Ceremony. Bet he got to eat expensive cuisines right now.”</p>\n<p>“Well, it’ll be easier with Mister Snake here. I’ve got some coins I want to show you, I wonder if it works to use them for--” Shira sneakily glanced at his cousin, then turned back to Monkey like it was nothing, “--for the thing we talked about yesterday.”</p>\n<p>Mila sneered, “You have some business to attend, no?”</p>\n<p>“Not really, no,” Shira shrugged off her question.</p>\n<p>“Really, though?” Mila crossed her arms, sneered again. “I think I saw Romana just now. I’mma chat with her a little bit.”</p>\n<p>It seemed to Shira that his cousin meeting with Romana here, in Malikh Family’s Ngajen Ceremony, wasn’t simply to have fun. He didn’t like his cousin would make trouble but he didn’t want to spend the whole night with her either. “Don’t go home without me,” he said eventually.</p>\n<p>“Hmph! You’re not a kid anymore but still need me to accompany you home?”</p>\n<p>No, Shira actually was more worried about her than himself.</p>\n<p>He then glanced beside and said, “Mister Monkey.”</p>\n<p>“Just Monkey,” Monkey corrected.</p>\n<p>“Mister Just Monkey, you said Mister Snake with relative? And his relatives are Malikh Family’s guests?”</p>\n<p>“Not Just Mon--ah, forget about it,” Monkey already gave up guessing whether Young Master Shira Yashura was purposely pulling his leg or not. “They really were Malikh Family’s guests, they even got the front row for the prayer and all.”</p>\n<p>“Is hard for us to be friendly if Mister Snake is involved with Malikh Family.”</p>\n<p>“You mean, that, huh? Well, I’ve been here for a while and they talked about you a lot, so I guess even someone as chill as you can get angry sometimes. But you don’t have to worry about those Malikhs, Young Master Shira. As long as their patriarch is Ghalim Malikh they won’t sever ties with Yashura so easily.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, is this your opinion?”</p>\n<p>“It’s Snake’s. It’s what he said before he met his relatives.”</p>\n<p>Shira thought the Alchemist he met once before was a total stranger of Badril Village, but it appeared he was wrong. “He really does know about Malikh Family that much, doesn’t he?”</p>\n<p>“Well, yeah, but I think he’s more familiar with Yashura than Malikh Family, though,” Monkey said, crossing his arms and nodded to himself as he recalled things that Snake told him to get his wares supported by Yashura Family; for example, obtaining Butler Yulong’s permission the same as Patriarch Shuro Yashura’s, Snake once said.</p>\n<p>“What? Why do you make that kind of face, Young Master Shira?” Monkey was snapped from his train of thought.</p>\n<p>“Ah, no, I just don’t expect you’re going to say some like that.”</p>\n<p>“What are you saying, young master. In the first place, Snake became my crew because he heard I’ve some dealing with Yashura Family.”</p>\n<p>Shira did recall the first time Monkey contacted Yashura Family--through him. To be more exact, the first item Monkey dealt from Malikh Family was Shira’s smuggled erotic painting that Good-Natured Spirit rejected.</p>\n<p>“--Speaking of Snake,” with his thumb Monkey did point in a certain direction. The place was separated from the common guest as they indeed were Malikh Family’s special guests. Shira’s eyes followed and he saw the familiar Alchemist he knew not long ago, Snake, was talking with two men, young and old, most likely brother and his grandfather.</p>\n<p>“Don’t be fooled by their appearances, young master. They’re renowned experts,” Monkey said.</p>\n<p>The pair of brother and grandfather wore worn out pale robes as their clothes, unlike the image of revered experts in Shira’s mind. Monkey told him both likely to travel incognito for various reasons. The old man had an old white hair and long beard, his back crooked and had to bring a walking staff to support himself, and gave people the impression of a sleepy grandpa from the dim light on his eyes. The young one though, had an always angry-looking face with fierce brows, crossing his muscle-thick arms, locked in a debate with Snake. Snake’s face was notably paler than when Shira met him in the market.</p>\n<p>“We can’t greet Mister Snake now, can we?” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think we can,” Monkey said. Even though he long considered Snake as his partner, the two guests appearing incognito were still the main members of the revered Alchemist family. This was no time for commoners like him acting friendly on them all of the sudden.</p>\n<p>The sleepy-looking old man, noticing two pairs of eyes looking at him, he raised his head. He caught the sight of Shira. Their eyes met.</p>\n<p>“Oh ho,” the old man smiled when he found the boy. He dragged his old body to approach the flastergabbed Shira and Monkey.</p>\n<p>Even Monkey who knew more about them wouldn’t expect Snake’s relatives to introduce themselves first.</p>\n<p>“He’s heading this way…”</p>\n<p>“Ah, yes, apparently.”</p>\n<p>Monkey gulped. “It’s different with Snake. Although he looked like that, whatever you do, please, young master, you can’t afford to be rude in front of this elder…”</p>\n<p>From the nervousness in Monkey’s voice Shira found the approaching old man seemed to hail from a more prestigious family than he originally thought.</p>\n<p>“Greeting, elder,” Shira said with his head humbly lowered as soon as he approached.</p>\n<p>The old man chuckled, patted Shira’s head, said, “Ah, Young Master, look how much you’ve grown. It feels like only yesterday how happy you were running around like a little kid you are.”</p>\n<p>Shira nodded hearing that. He glanced beside him, and caught Monkey’s face flabbergasted looking both at the boy and the old man.</p>\n<p>Hiding his embarrassment behind a fake cough, Shira then tried to understand whether the old man mistook him for someone else. “I’m sorry, elder. I don’t know if I’m mistaken, but, have we met before?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, have we met? Of course we’ve--” he stopped. The old man's eyes were covered by a pair of soft hands of a girl.</p>\n<p>“Guess who this is?” the girl who sneakily teased the old man from behind was grinning.</p>\n<p>“Oho! Who is this? Who is this?” the old man smiled delightedly.</p>\n<p>Both Shira and Monkey were tense watching the scene before them. Especially Shira Yashura, who knew that the grin on his cousin’s face always told that the girl enjoyed herself a little bit too much.</p>\n<p>“Isn’t this… Tomboy Princess?” the old man guessed.</p>\n<p>“Tuut! Wrong!”</p>\n<p>Mila released her hands. When the old man turned to see the preparator, he exclaimed with a chuckle.</p>\n<p>“It’s really you, Tomboy Princess.”</p>\n<p>Mila excitedly echoed, “It’s really you, Grandpa Piss!”</p>\n<p>They were so glad they met after a long time that they started to hug each other. Then Mila pull herself from the oldman’s embrace, yelling, “Ugghh…” she pinched her nose, “I smell something pissy around here.”</p>\n<p>Just when Shira and Monkey wondered what Mila meant by that, the girl looked at the old man, saying, “It’s no wonder it smells pissy. Have you taken a bath, Grandpa Piss.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss answered with a laugh. But Shira and Monkey facepalmed.</p>\n<p>So much for being mindful in front of the revered old expert.</p>\n<p>Shira awkwardly smiled to cover his shame. “Mila, you should be mindful in front of elders.”</p>\n<p>“Mindful?” Mila gasped. “In front of Grandpa Piss? Why?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, it’s okay, young master,” the old man said as he waved his hand. “I’m not that old to lose my sense of humor. Yashura Family’s princess sure is as naughty as always.” His wrinkles deepened as he curled his lips into a big smile. He said to Mila, “I reckon Patriarch Shuro’s been well, my princess? I recall he got a lot of migraines back in the day.”</p>\n<p>Haughtily, Mila replied, “Don’t worry about that guy, Grandpa Piss. His brain capacity has been declining these past years so there’s really nothing left inside to give him any headache!”</p>\n<p>“Ehem,” Shira cleared his phlegm. “She meant our patriarch has been well, elder.”</p>\n<p>“That’s what I said,” Mila laughed, and the old man laughed too. After that Mila kissed Grandpa Piss’s right hand as if she was kissing an elder’s hand from her own family, then continued laughing as cheeky as always.</p>\n<p>“My naughty princess,” Grandpa Piss ruffled Mila’s hair, “I planned to visit Yashura Family later. But since we’ve already met, here, please take this.”</p>\n<p>Receiving a pack wrapped in dried leaves, Mila pouted her lips. “You wouldn’t be lying about this being a candy again, would you?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, of course not.”</p>\n<p>As far as her memory served her well, what Grandpa Piss called candy actually a really bitter herb for young children to gain their appetite. Mila sniffed. She opened it and have a little taste. “Uuueeekk!”</p>\n<p>It was sour and even more bitter than she remembered. “What the hell is this?!”</p>\n<p>“That herb’s not for consumption, Young Lady Mila” the big man with muscles, Snake’s big brother, said from behind Grandpa Piss. He was smiling politely despite the other party merely a young lady of a rural village. “It’s a cosmetic for skin care.”</p>\n<p>“Skin care?!”</p>\n<p>Mila’s mouth widened agape. But soon as she glanced at the muscle man who was approaching her, she became wary, leaned to Grandpa Piss and whispered, “Grandpa Piss, who’s that?”</p>\n<p>With a patient smile replied, Grandpa Piss said, “He’s Snotty. Don’t you remember Snotty?”</p>\n<p>Mila was surprised. “Oooohh! Snotty! You’ve turned into a real man now I can’t even recognize you anymore!”</p>\n<p>“Haha… you’re surely jest young lady,” Snotty said.</p>\n<p>“No, really…” with fingers on her chin, eyes on muscles, Mila added, “you really transformed into something new, Snotty. I’m impressed. You were so skinny and really a snotty boy back then.”</p>\n<p>The man continued to laugh. The atmosphere was friendly and harmless. Yet Monkey, who had long heard Snotty’s real identity and preceding reputation from Snake’s mouth, began sweating profusely.</p>\n<p>Mila really loved gifted cosmetics and the like. After knowing how effective it was for her beauty, she shamelessly asked, “Can I ask for more, Grandpa Piss? I have a good friend who needs to be a beauty--as soon as possible!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, of course I have more--here, take this,” Grandpa Piss took out another one.</p>\n<p>“Waow!” Mila’s eyes sparkled in a weird glint. Shira, who saw that, knew his cousin’s greed began to surface; suddenly the unruly young lady acted as if she was a timid maiden. “Grandpa Piss… I think my other friend needs it too…” she asked sweetly.</p>\n<p>“Hohoh!” Grandpa Piss stroked his beard again. “Unfortunately, my princess, I’ve got only three pack and I planned to give the last one for Young Lady Malikh.”</p>\n<p>Hearing a certain short-haired girl being mentioned, the shy maiden’s face twisted in an ugly sour face, returned back to her original color. “Tch.”</p>\n<p>“Hey, don’t click your tongue in front of elders,” Shira warned her.</p>\n<p>“Tch.” Mila crossed her arms and threw away her pouting face.</p>\n<p>Shira was always frustrated whenever a younger one like him would be the one to reprimand ethics into this blockhead of a girl.</p>\n<p>“Now, now, young lady. Please remember Grandpa’s already too old to concoct too many cosmetics--getting two packs already good enough,” Snotty said.</p>\n<p>Snake looked at the leaves wrapped cosmetics in Mila’s hands and exclaimed, “Grandfather concocted them himself?”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss nodded with an amiable smile. “Of course. Been twelve years since the last time I was here. It’d be embarrassing if I came with half-hearted gifts, don’t you think so?”</p>\n<hr>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>The nickname of “Grandpa Piss” stuck on Grandmaster Alchemist’s name for twelve years. When a friend of his asked the origin of this horrible nickname, the Grandmaster laughed it off and said a princess of his old friend’s family started calling him that, because her cousin who was still a three years old brat urinated on him every time the Grandmaster tried to hug him.</p>\n<p>Legend said that the princess was also calling the heir of Grandmaster Alchemist’s family with the nickname of “Snotty”. But even to this day, nobody knows which kingdom this cheeky princess comes from.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n","unregistered":[{"contributor":"Kaboom","where":"volume-1/chapter-3"}]},"novels/yashura-legacy/contents/volume-1/chapter-4.md":{"contributions":{},"lastModified":1605166952252,"data":{"title":"The Generation's Best Unique Class"},"body":"<p>Badril Village, though had been two years passed without her presence, was the same as always for Bhela Malikh. She hadn’t that many acquaintances her age she could consider friendly before. In spite of that, from the day she returned, people act as if they were her rekindled childhood friends she never knew she had.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” a daughter of an elder from Elzhier Family asked curiously, “is the rumor about that story true?”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at her with eyelids half-closed.</p>\n<p>“Which rumor?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, silly you, of course <em>that</em> rumor! The one about your romance with a blue blood noble!”</p>\n<p>Giggles of girls followed after the girl’s words. When Bhela returned to Badril Village she brought not only fame and reputation, but interesting stories and rumors as well. She was currently surrounded by curious young ladies who sought for exciting gossip.</p>\n<p>“Yeah, yeah!” another girl excitedly hussing in low voice. “I heard he’ll attend Malikh’s ngajen ceremony tonight!”</p>\n<p>“Really?”</p>\n<p>“Why else would Young Lady Bhela take the Chef Chief position if she didn’t expect for her lover to come tonight? He’ll come for sure!”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, yeah, everybody is saying Young Lady Bhela doing just for that!”</p>\n<p>Bhela found it was amazing how people could conjure their own rumors despite not seeing the true story by their own eyes.</p>\n<p>And just when the young ladies started getting excited discussing Young Lady Bhela’s ‘love life’, a vigorous shout resounded the courtyard announcing that Blackwood Family had arrived.</p>\n<p>“Blackwood Family?” someone cocked their head and looked over the direction of the gate. “What kind of family is so bold announcing their names in other family’s ngajen ceremony? Not even Village Head’s Elzhier Family would do to the ceremony host!”</p>\n<p>“Only foreigners to be that stupid to be rude in big family like Malikh! If this is my place I’d send a guard to kick their ass out as soon as possible!”</p>\n<p>“Look over there! Malikh Family elders are rushing to the gate! Let’s check out how’s Malikhs going to deal with it!”</p>\n<p>Curious guests were tailing the elders to see some commotion they thought would occur. However, not only did the Malikhs not make a fuss over it, they even bowed their heads toward the newly arrived noble as if they were servants greeting their returning master. Young people were overly excited because nobles were foreign and appeared in stories all of their lives.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Mila, who already went back with her friend, was gritting teeth with anger. Beside her Romana was holding the tomboy back, though concerned she didn't say a word.</p>\n<p>“Why should I am the one who always had to hold myself back?” Mila hissed in a low voice as if she was wronged.</p>\n<p>“Look around and think about who’s receiving the blow the most. Everyone’s talking about your cousin right now--do you want to make it worse for him?”</p>\n<p>After hearing her friend’s warning, Mila began to take a deep breath and think things through. Romana was right. When she opened her ears Mila could hear people comparing the young master of this noble Blackwood Family with her cousin Shira. They compared such a gallant-looking young noble with a trash of Yashura Family young master, adding with their own biased seasoning here and there, making her cousin Shira look really bad. Mila trembled as her face boiled red from holding back her anger.</p>\n<p>“Where’s Shira right now?”</p>\n<p>“I think he went hiding!” Romana said.</p>\n<p>“Hiding?! He’s embarrassed to show his face that much?”</p>\n<p>After circling around a bit, Mila found the boy’s silhouette in the shadow far from the braziers' light. There, he was squatting, hiding along with two other silhouettes who were also squatting in a suspicious manner.</p>\n<p>“Now, young master, where the hell did you get this coin?” someone whispered from the suspicious bunch.</p>\n<p>The reply came also in the same hushed manner. “Don’t ask me now, just know I’ve got a few more hidden in my house. I can’t move my family, but if you’re fine with this, I can invest in your goods earlier.”</p>\n<p>“We’re fine? Of course we’re fine! Don’t you know how amazing this coin is?”</p>\n<p>“It’s amazing? I can’t even buy satays with this. Nobody here would receive unfamiliar currency.”</p>\n<p>“But don’t you know how far ahead you can go if merchants know you grab some of these coins?”</p>\n<p>“You tell me.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, these coins weren’t issued by any countries, but they’re valuable. Lots of herbs and ingredients in the black markets can only be bought with these coins...”</p>\n<p><em>...whisper whisper whisper...</em></p>\n<p>Mila approached.</p>\n<p>“Ey, what are you doing?!”</p>\n<p>For some reasons, Shira and Monkey, one of his companions, almost jumped in fright by her barking. Both Mila and Romana behind her saw Shira and Monkey were acting suspicious--but Sneak, the third silhouette, didn’t even try to hide that he was nibbling on something delicious.</p>\n<p>Mila, with a weird face, hissed, “Is that… <em>rendang</em> you guys were eating?”</p>\n<p>“<em>Cough, cough,</em>” hiding the opened wrapping banana leaves, Shira awkwardly trying to make an excuse, “I think Malikh Family is too eager to cut off relationships with our Yashura Family so… I reckon they don’t need this anymore…”</p>\n<p>Mila was so angry she slapped the banana leaves in Shira’s hand.</p>\n<p>“Ah, my rendang…”</p>\n<p>“Your rendang?! You goddamn moron!” Mila hissed, she didn’t dare to roar and announce themselves to other guests. “You’re about to get cuckolded and all you think about is a goddamn rendang?!”</p>\n<p>“Young master, someone trying to get you cuckolded?” licking his fingers for some leftover rendang sauce, Snake asked from the side.</p>\n<p>Shira shook his head. “Cuckold is a very strong word. That girl didn’t even consider me from the beginning. It’s not like we're a married couple yet.”</p>\n<p>He then came to pick the spoiled beef and mourned, “ah… my poor rendang.”</p>\n<p>“Stop crying over that shit! It’s not important!”</p>\n<p>Monkey blurted, “Rendang is not important?”</p>\n<p>Mila glared at Monkey. The monkey-faced peddler closed his mouth as soon as he opened it.</p>\n<p>Romana saw her friend Mila had a bad affinity with her cousin whenever she was angry, thus came to explain from the side, “Young Master Shira, don’t you know people outside the Mossack culture do take engagement seriously? It’s understandable for a young heir of a conservative family like Yashura to not care much about it--but, whatever your feelings regarding your engagement is, if Young Lady Bhela has an affair outside, she’ll also drag down Yashura Family’s reputation. So please be mindful about it more for the sake of your family.”</p>\n<p>They didn’t really think about this deeply since straightforward Mossack people were the type to have children before they were even married. If things went awry, Shira reckoned his uncle and the elders in his family might think the engagement matter was similar to puppy love, about children bantering, but the young generation who was exposed to stories and gossips from books and travellers might think about it differently. And someone who didn’t hang out so much like Shira wouldn’t be able to tell how these youngsters would talk about this incident in the future.</p>\n<p>So Shira stood up and patted his trouser, admitted, “Ah, you’re right, Romana.”</p>\n<p>Mila crossed her arms. Frowning at her cousin. “What are you gonna do now? Fight them? No need to be afraid, I’m with you.”</p>\n<p>Snake, still squatting comfortably, added, “Young Master, my grandfather and my older brother are still here too. You won’t be at a disadvantage in case things go downhill.”</p>\n<p>“It’s decided. Let’s kick their asses!” Mila growled.</p>\n<p>“The heck are you talking about kicking people’s asses in Ngajen Ceremony?” Shira grunted.</p>\n<p>“Then at least let me slap that slut’s arrogant face!”</p>\n<p>Shira shook his head.</p>\n<p>“Let’s go,” he said.</p>\n<p>“We’re gonna slap her face now?” Mila asked.</p>\n<p>“No. We at least have to make Family Yashura’s presence known here,” Shira said. He caught his companions’ confused expressions, so he added, “Everyone is getting excited because most of them are young'uns. But if this incident gets out of the hands, the elders from other families won’t be silent about it.”</p>\n<p>Mila wanted to say something but didn’t after seeing Shira’s relaxed face. She didn’t want to say something silly that’d change the boy’s mind. Therefore, with Shira leading the way, she and her friend Romana went to see the ruckus caused by the noble’s arrival. Leaving Monkey and Sneak who were silent looking at their back.</p>\n<p>The two exchanged glances.</p>\n<p>They looked down, eyes sweeping the ground.</p>\n<p>“Mm?” Monkey mumbled, his hands crawling all over the dirt.</p>\n<p>Snake took out a magic wand. The wand shimmered with a gentle light, then he used that to give some light to the ground where the rendang was spoiled.</p>\n<p>But it was Monkey who shouted in joy, “I got one!”</p>\n<p>“Give me that!” Snake pounced the moment he saw Monkey rubbed the dirt of a piece of rendang.</p>\n<p>Pushing out Snake’s face from grabbing the rendang in his hand, Monkey felt wronged and cried, “Why would a rich gentleman like you fight over a single beef with this poor peddler? Don’t you know my family can only afford to eat beef once a year?”</p>\n<p>“Why, you asked?” Snake sneered, “There’s no need to say the obvious. You don’t get to eat Patriarch Shuro’s handmade rendang everyday! And I’m saying this after starving for beef ever since I’m following you.”</p>\n<p>“Fuck off!”</p>\n<p>“Give me that!”</p>\n<p>“No!”</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the shadowy corner where they were wrestling came to be lightened up with a lit torch.</p>\n<p>“Ehem, you two gentlemen,” a voice called.</p>\n<p>For a moment, Monkey and Snake stopped fighting.</p>\n<p>The voice owner was a man with Malikh Family’s servant uniform. Reluctantly, he continued, “Badril Village locals are usually open-minded and tolerant people. However, we have a bottom line. If you two couldn’t hold it you should rent some inn room or do it in the bushes! Don’t do it in the open, you’re making people uncomfortable! Know some shame!”</p>\n<p>Monkey at first didn’t get what the servant was talking about. Then he realized during infighting over the rendang, he had opened his legs, and Snake was on top of him in a very, very awkward manner.</p>\n<p>“Dammit!” he kicked Snake and trembling over the horror he caught himself in. But suddenly he noticed the rendang in his hand already vanished. He whirled his head around. Snake was already licking his fingers with a satisfied face.</p>\n<p>“Dammit!” Monkey howled again.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The one who enthusiastically greeted the young noble of Blackwood Family was Elder Jhamil instead of Bhela Malikh. He managed to conjure thirty years worth of bullshitting skills to flatter and fawn over the other party, rather thick faced to continue despite the young master of noble family rolled his eyes several times. As soon as the young noble caught the sight of a short-haired girl he immediately escaped from Elder Jhamil’s clutch with a big grin on his face.</p>\n<p>“Ah, Sister Bhela!”</p>\n<p>“Young Master Frane Blackwood.”</p>\n<p>“How are you doing Young Lady Bhela? Fancy to meet you again,” he said as he gifted the girl a flower.</p>\n<p>Bhela received the flower but then immediately passed it to a random maidservant beside her. She said as if it was nothing, “I’m fine. Thank you.”</p>\n<p>Young Master Frane Blackwood smiled wryly. “I’ve been travelling with hardly any rest so that I can see you sooner, my young lady,” the young master of Blackwood Family, Frane Blackwood, said, “may I be so lucky to receive your company tonight?”</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry, but here the words ‘tonight’s companion’ have different meanings than when you say it in the western-style ball--so, no, Young Master Blackwood, I can’t give you company tonight,” she said.</p>\n<p>The young noble still had a smile and wanted to correct his wording, but Bhela suddenly raised her hand and said, “Excuse me.”</p>\n<p>She went past him and greeted another pair of guests instead.</p>\n<p>“Greeting, sir, madam.”</p>\n<p>“It’s about time,” the middle-aged man didn’t answer Bhela’s greeting, but complained instead. “You know the other families had begun their ceremonies, right? Even though we don’t have the same ceremony as your Ngajen Ceremony from the place where I come from, but I know those who don’t take any old ceremonies seriously only brought bad luck over their lands.”</p>\n<p>There was a rare restraint in Bhela’s voice as she replied, “I apologize for our bad conduct, Sir Instructor. I will request the elders to proceed with the ceremony. Please let me lead you toward the reserved spot I previously prepared for both of you.”</p>\n<p>“Lead the way then.”</p>\n<p>Badril Village locals witnessed the valiant Young Lady of Malikh Family taking charge of the Ngajen Ceremony as the Chief Chef, but with the appearance of her bowing to two unfamiliar guests as well, whispers were floating amongst the Ngajen Ceremony guests. Before long, everyone knew that two guests Bhela Malikh greeted were the ones she personally invited, but was neglected before the family’s gate because of the excitement made by the noble’s arrival. Bhela came to them to apologize in person.</p>\n<p>Young Master Frane Blackwood, who felt ignored, pulled a self-decrepitating sneer. He complained to Elder Jhamil instead, “Oh, Malikh Family elder, can you tell me the identity of those two guests who made even Young Lady Bhela to bow her head?”</p>\n<p>“Ehem, ehem,” Elder Jhamil didn’t know what to answer, so he concocted a reply out of thin air, “I think they were relatives from her maternal family.”</p>\n<p>“Is that so? From the way they are dressed, they don’t look from that respectable background enough to get the young lady’s full attention. Don’t you think so?”</p>\n<p>“Young noble is right. Young Lady Bhela’s father once was a gangster thus he didn’t manage to teach common sense to the young lady. I’ll talk to her later to explain what’s really important.”</p>\n<p>After a bit of excuse and fawning, Young Master Blackwood felt this Elder Jhamil was acceptable. He told the Blackwood Family’s servants to bring the gifts he had prepared, which were naturally accepted by Elder Jhamil on the young lady’s behalf. In the meantime, people were disappointed that the drama they were expecting didn’t happen. But what could they do besides shaking their heads and disperse?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Year after year, the ngajen ceremony evolved from stiff sessions of praying ceremony for village safety to the new stylish festivities of foods and happy times for the youngsters, where fads and trends emerge. However big their way of life was changing the conservative major families, Yashura and Elzhier, still pretty much followed the old ways, especially when it came to the prayers. Only Malikh Family amongst the three that eager to embrace the new world that was coming. And by Elder Jhamil’s direction, instead of local shamans, Malikh Family asked help from foreign priests from western orthodox temples from nearby villages to lead the prayer.</p>\n<p>It was all good if one made a progressive decision with the greater good in mind. But here was the problem; orthodox temple priests usually led prayers for abundant harvest, while Ngajen Ceremony was all about calming Selaqs from descending the mountain. These priests probably hadn’t any clue how Selaqs looked like.</p>\n<p>“It was inappropriate for a noble to pray to old Mossack deities they don’t believe in, that was Malikhs’ excuses,'' Mila complained non-stop since they finished praying with other guests. In her hands--like a young mother hugging her baby--were plates of food she had just plundered from Malikh Family’s banquet tables prepared to entertain guests.</p>\n<p>“What deity? Wasn’t the mantra replaced from ancient Mossack prayers to magic spell mantra to calm down Selaq since… I don’t know, fifty years ago?” Romana said. The food in her hands was no less than Mila’s. These two girls seemed to think Malikh Family would regret offending them if they plunder the latter’s prepared feast like no tomorrow.</p>\n<p>“That's what I was saying! We no longer those ancient Mossacks who would sacrifice relatives so Selaqs won’t come down the mountain! Nowadays we’ve been using legit spells to keep all those Selaqs away, and these stupid Malikhs want to change the tradition just to appease some visiting noble? They’d rather avoid their noble guest to be uncomfortable than preventing Selaqs from coming down to chew their stupid brains, hah!”</p>\n<p>Compared to noisy girls beside him, Shira was able to keep his head to his feet. Romana signaled Mila with her eyes when she realized the boy wasn’t so into retaliating against the Malikhs; instead of invading the feast Shira, grabbed Malikh Family’s snacks moderately whenever he could--just like any other normal guests that came here.</p>\n<p>Mila grumbled with a bad mood, faced Shira and said, “Don’t you have something you need to do?”</p>\n<p>“Like what?” Shira hoped this cheeky cousin of his wouldn’t say something about kicking people’s asses again.</p>\n<p>“We can’t wait for something to happen,” she said. “Go ask that bitc--I mean, that fiancée of yours--go ask for a dance. The young’uns are starting to get heated. Look there, one of them couples are dancing. You go join them since that short-haired cunt is your fiancée after all.”</p>\n<p>Mila glanced around for a while before she realized she just had her tongue slipped. She quickly corrected her previous words, “Did I say cunt? I mean short-haired bitch--no, short-haired <em>young lady</em>.”</p>\n<p>“Why don’t you just be honest with yourself here. People have been calling Malikhs much worse here because the foreign priests matter!” Romana laughed.</p>\n<p>At that moment a very young maidservant of Malikh Family just passed by and overheard their conversation. The little maidservant snorted in anger, which made Mila snorted back as a retort.</p>\n<p>“Go, go! Go dance with her!” Mila whispered when she was sure only Shira and Romana were around.</p>\n<p>Shira clicked his tongue. “I don’t even have a single proper conversation with her these past ten years. Why should I go ask her dance out of the blue? Just showing our face around here is enough.”</p>\n<p>“Fool! If she accepted to dance with you then all is good, that would only confirm Malikh Family’s cocky attitude is only because their dipshit brains are getting fried by their own inflated proud ego, nothing serious! But if she ignores you in front of others… heh--she dares!”</p>\n<p>“That’s easy for you to say. If someone you don’t like suddenly asks your hands for a dance, what would you feel later on when you found out refusing means two families become enemies?”</p>\n<p>“Uh-uh, I don’t feel nothing. If he’s my fiancé then it’s my job to go my way out to make it clear in public! Going dancing, going kissing, like a proper damned couple! That’s what the goddamn engagement is all about! Right?”</p>\n<p>Mila ate a cookie and she blinked. Unsure of the previous words she said, she glanced at Romana and murmured, “...right?”</p>\n<p>Romana shrugged.</p>\n<p>But Shira wouldn’t back down easily. He continued arguing, “What if your fiancé is Bony Elzhier, then? Are you going to kiss him to prove he’s your fiancé?”</p>\n<p>Mila hid her gasp.</p>\n<p>“You wanna die?” she pursed her lips. “Listen to me or I’m gonna smack your face!”</p>\n<p>Shira groaned against his cousin’s unreasonableness. But before he could concoct a satisfying retort, Snake and Monkey came out of nowhere.</p>\n<p>“Oh, Young Master Shira,” Monkey came patting him on the shoulder, “it seems you get cuckolded for real this time.”</p>\n<p>People were clapping and whistling as the flashy Young Master Frane Blackwood led Young Lady Bhela Malikh by the hand.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Malikh was entertaining two guests previously, but that bald elder raised a fuss about how she neglected the young noble, so in the end it came to this.”</p>\n<p>Monkey laughed as he teased Shira with his elbow, “They’re going to dance. When two people were dancing in Ngajen Ceremony, that meant they--” he caught the scary experssion on Mila’s face, stopped, “nevermind…”</p>\n<p>“That slut!” Mila hissed.</p>\n<p>This was getting serious. Whenever Mila showed that kind of face something bad would happen. Again, the moment Shira opened his mouth to say something, someone else came to grab him in the shoulder.</p>\n<p>“Brat, your woman is going to cuckold you in public,” said the newcomer, Good-Natured Spirit, who literally came out of the thin air.</p>\n<p>“You too?”</p>\n<p>Shira had a headache. Both Monkey and Snake couldn’t see the annoying Good-Natured Spirit, but the three of them were in harmony in mocking him. They mocked him to the point saying he wouldn’t care would only embarrass him further.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, being led by the hand, Bhela Malikh asked Young Master Blackwood, “What kind of remedy Blackwood Family brought with you?”</p>\n<p>“Why so much in hurry, my young lady?” the young noble gave a laugh and a flash of smile. “No need to worry, Blackwood Family sympathize with the disaster that befell your father, so my mother send me here to personally deliver the medicine Blackwood House had sought far and wide.”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh said nothing more. The Young Master of Blackwood Family pondered as he read the cold expression of the girl, thinking that even with flowers and jewelry gifts, nothing could move this young lady. Such a waste of that beautiful face to not letting a single smile escaped, Young Master Blackwood could only smacked his lips and shook his head. But as soon as he mentioned a medicine he brought for her father, the feisty young lady became amiable almost immediately.</p>\n<p>Good thing for him. Bhela Malikh was talented, the Blackwood Family planned to have her inside their house, and if things went this smoothly he could do that his mother told him sooner than he expected.</p>\n<p>“Little bitch of Malikh Family,” a girl roared, “you finally show your true color you bitch! Is Yashura Family a joke to you?!”</p>\n<p>The furious Mila Yashura became the center of attention. She snorted as she strode, like an angry bull preparing to charge, with the mood that would make the crowd wordlessly give way to her. Not only because they didn’t want anything to do with the infamous young lady of Yashura Family--who, when angry, once punched Bony in the face with a nosebleed--but also because she got a sword in her hands.</p>\n<p>Shira glanced down. His father’s sword he brought with him was gone. He looked again at the unsheated weapon in his cousin’s hands.</p>\n<p>He could only slap his own face the moment he noticed what was happened.</p>\n<p>Mila took a step forward slowly, but her face turned even fiercer. She spoke, “You got guts to bring a lover from outside, eh? I knew something fishy happened when I saw you cut your hair, you little slut.”</p>\n<p>“I cut my hair because it got in the way during my training,” Bhela replied plainly. “And this is not my lover. Just a relative of my friend.”</p>\n<p>“You lying little slut. As if someone like you have any friends!”</p>\n<p>“I do have a friend.” Bhela said. A rare emphasizing tone in her voice was telling that she was upset, but she held back from explaining further.</p>\n<p>“I don’t care what your excuse is! Do you think I don’t know what you shitty Malikhs up to? You already don’t put Yashura Family in your eyes, eh? Just because you bitch have a little vacation outside, eh? If you think you’re a big shot, why don’t you prove it here and now?!”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh was silent for a while. Looking at Mila, she then asked, “And what are you suggesting I should do, Young Lady Yashura?”</p>\n<p>Mila stabbed her sword into the ground.</p>\n<p>“I just want to know how awesome is this Archer class you’ve got overseas that makes you Malikhs stop putting us Yashuras in your eyes,” Mila sneered. “Why don’t we test it with my sword, eh? Let’s do a duel, bitch.”</p>\n<p>Bhela just looked at Mila strangely.</p>\n<p>“But you’re a Specialist class,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Aha! Getting scared, aren’t ya, you little cunt?”</p>\n<p>Bhela didn’t want to argue with her. So she told the nearest servant to go grab a bow.</p>\n<p>On the other side, Monkey anxiously elbowed Shira, said, “Should I drag your cousin back?”</p>\n<p>“Stand down, mister. Mila is the one who’s starting it. She can’t afford to back down now.”</p>\n<p>Beside them Snake was nodding as he understood what Shira meant.</p>\n<p>Then with a laugh, Good-Natured Spirit, who was already tired jeering him, said to Shira. “Kid, shit just got real. Ain’t that a good idea to pull her before it’s too late?”</p>\n<p>Shira wanted to but he couldn’t. He knew exactly Mila’s strength. Fighting bare hands, she might get a chance to stand against the strongest youngster in the village, but it would become a different story when weapons and mana were involved.</p>\n<p>Since Mila was the one to propose the duel, bailing out before the fight began would be slapping her own face in front of the guests. It was a bad idea, because Mila didn’t appear to have the slightest chance to win. So bad that it’d be more reasonable to just surrender. But Shira knew Mila hated to go back on her words the most. Thus he silently moved closer to her, prepared to pull her back in before the situation really got out of his hands.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Young Master Blackwood, was pulled out by an adjutant of his family.</p>\n<p>Smirking, he asked the adjutant, “Who is that girl who picking a fight with Bhela?”</p>\n<p>“Seems like the eldest young lady of that family,” the adjutant replied.</p>\n<p>“You mean the family my Bhela got engaged to?” Young Master Frane Blackwood asked as if Bhela already his. The corner of his lips curled as he thought this might be a good chance to do something on the engagement that Blackwood House already saw as a thorn in their eyes. “Do you have something on that girl?”</p>\n<p>“Replying to young master, since Yashura Family is the main obstacle for us to get Young Lady Bhela Malikh to our side, your mother has already sent someone to investigate them. The eldest young lady of Yashura Family merely a Level 10 Specialist class who just graduated from Novice about seven months ago.”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood couldn’t help but chuckle. Even though the two young ladies had the same level, a Specialist merely support class that wasn’t suited in combat. This duel affair would turn out to be a joke.</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood scoffed. “Let my Bhela teach her some manners. I don’t want anyone to disturb us after this.”</p>\n<p>“Young master,” the adjutant lowered his voice, “I don’t think that’s a good idea.”</p>\n<p>“What’s on your mind, adjutant?”</p>\n<p>“I just made a round to check the guests attending this ceremony, and I found…”--he lowered his voice--“...some spectators amongst the guests that shouldn’t have be here….”</p>\n<p>“Go on,” the young noble urged.</p>\n<p>“I just received the word, young master, there are experts that Elder Jhamil said he didn’t invite.”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood frowned. “What… what’s that supposed to mean?”</p>\n<p>On the less crowded place of the courtyard, the middle-aged man who Bhela greeted before, along with the middle-aged woman, watched the commotion unfold while nibbling on steamed peanuts. He glanced at the other place where a man calmly sipping tea, a man with a hard face who couldn’t hide his sharp aura, then swept his gaze at the one who beside him, a short stature man who wore a headband to hide his reddish hair from public, who also happened to enjoy steamed peanuts while his focus solely at one direction in the crowd.</p>\n<p>All of them came in common garments incognito. But still Elder Jhamil sent people to keep tabs on them, especially since the bald elder still didn’t know the reason Bhela Malikh invited these foreigners.</p>\n<p>The ngajen ceremony usually consisted of three main parts--prayer, socializing, and sending offerings to the mountain as the finale. It was uncommon for irrelevant events to happen between them. However, since the young lady of the host had already accepted the duel, Malikh Family set up an emergency venue for the fight.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil came to invite himself as the judge. For a change to hummiliate those simple Yashuras and to slip himself onto the spotlight, he couldn’t ask for better opportunity.</p>\n<p>“You two ready?” Elder Jhamil asked both of the opposing sides. “This is a friendly match between two friendly families. So stop before your blade hit your enemy,” he said, seemingly talking to either sides, but didn’t say anything about the arrows part.</p>\n<p>Since Bhela Malikh was an Archer, she suggested to Mila, “I’m using a bow. So you can move first. I’ll try to dodge for ten seconds.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t need that,” Mila scoffed.</p>\n<p>“Very well…” she said. She glanced at Elder Jhamil, said, “Elder Jhamil, please begin the duel.&quot;</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil counted to three.</p>\n<p>The duel began.</p>\n<p>“AAAAAA!!!” Mila roared with the sword raised above her head, charging ahead.</p>\n<p>Contrast to her opponent’s battle cry, Bhela was solemn. She picked four arrows from the quiver tied on her hips. Nocking the arrows simultaneously, she took a deep breath as she concentrated to channel different natures elemental mana from her manasphere. The mana, through fingers and her thumb, flowing into all the four arrows and soon the tip of the arrows glowed with four different colors.</p>\n<p>The wind began to stir.</p>\n<p>And she raised the bow. She released the arrows.</p>\n<p><em>Fuuush fuuuushhh fuuushh shhuuuuusshh!</em></p>\n<p>Before even everyone noticed what happened, the mana Bhela channeled melted the flying arrows, within a span of milliseconds, turning them into dangerous magic projectiles of four elemental natures--fire, water, wind and lightning.</p>\n<p>Mila was confident before. She knew a trick against an Archer, but here she was dumbfounded by magic arrows coming to blast her way. She thought she was fighting an Archer, but got up against a Mage instead. This wasn’t what she signed up for.</p>\n<p><em>Clank!</em></p>\n<p>The first blue arrow dissapeared almost the moment it reached Mila. The sound of metallic clash that followed the said arrow resounded three more times, and the three arrows left behind too disappeared almost immediately. Mila, thought she ought to dodge the magic arrows, leap a step backward, but her hasty movement combined with the slippery mud made her slipped her foothold, accidentally fell to her butt instead.</p>\n<p>Bhela aimed down her bow. Everyone was staring at her with complicated and questioning gaze, as an Archer who could do magic, this was the first time everyone witnessed it.</p>\n<p>“It’s a four elemental affinity spell!” someone’s voice roared through the silenced venue, “I heard it, I doubted it, but she really did it!”</p>\n<p>Everyone looked at his way, the man who shouted, and saw that it was the middle-aged man whom Bhela invited from outside the village. He sat eating steamed peanuts then, now he was standing perplexed.</p>\n<p>Bhela, realizing that the man was the center of the attention, and bow to him from afar.</p>\n<p>“She really did it…” the man said under his breath.</p>\n<p>Someone who sat beside him said, “Sure she did, the only one right now--I guess now that you big brain from Elemental Stone School witnessed it I guess you can die without regret?”</p>\n<p>The man looked at the woman who accompanied him, he said still with expression of disbelieve, “It’s a four elemental affinity spell…”</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, you already said that.”</p>\n<p>The last and the most famous multi elemental Unique Class was, a mage with three elemental affinity skills, died of old age--was actually the headmaster of Elemental Stone School from seventy years ago. As a scholar and a mage researching deeply in topics of elemental mana all of his career, how could he didn’t know the value of a Unique Class who surpassed even the ex-headmaster of his school?</p>\n<p>“I can’t believe someone without a Mage Unique Class really did it…”</p>\n<p>“The most promising talent of this generation, alright, the first time I witnessed an Archer could do magic,” the woman said. “Good thing she stopped her arrows then--if not, the other girl would ended up so pitiful.”</p>\n<p>As the woman said that, someone else blurted not far away from there.</p>\n<p>“She didn’t stop it.”</p>\n<p>“Pardon? Sir Kurusiya?” the woman asked.</p>\n<p>The one she was talking to was the quiet man with sharp aura. He said as a matter of fact like tone, “She didn’t stop it. Someone else did,” he sipped his tea, and when the woman still confused, he explained with hoarse voice, “those are magic, but they were still arrows shot from a bow. You can’t stop flying arrows. That girl calculated and slightly missed her aim as to not hurting her opponent. But she didn’t plan to stop it.”</p>\n<p>The woman questioned him, “If she wasn’t the one who stopped it, then would you know why the arrows disappears?”</p>\n<p>The man put down his glass of tea. “I don’t know. Why you ask me? Ask that fool there who’s been grinning all the time.”</p>\n<p>The woman, along with the middle-aged man from Stone Elemental School, looked up to the bearded foreigner.</p>\n<p>“She’s not the one who stopped it,” the bearded man said with a smile.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Mila, who mellowed from her defeat and still sat on the muddy ground, gulped as she saw her cousin come to pick her up.</p>\n<p>“I lost,” she said to Shira.</p>\n<p>“No you didn’t, that girl is the one who put down her bow first, and you still got your swords in your hands--so technically you’d win.”</p>\n<p>“I fell to my butt, I was humiliated,” Mila said, her voice trembled, “I lost….”</p>\n<p>Shira sighed. He grabbed Mila’s hand and pulled her up. “It’s adult problems from hereon, Uncle Shuro would likely summon my father back. For now, let’s get out of here,” he said.</p>\n<p>Monkey and Snake, along with the nervous Romana, came to follow them from behind to shield them from people’s laughter. Mila was so humiliated the usually feisty tomboy was so down she couldn’t afford to hold her head straight. As Shira witnessed how pitiful his cousin was, regret overwhelming him when he remembered how he was holding back from taking action himself.</p>\n<p>“Brat,” someone called him.</p>\n<p>Shira turned his head. It was Good-Natured Spirit.</p>\n<p>“You owe me this time,” the Nalaq said.</p>\n<p>Shira nodded.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>“Hear ye hear ye people! Gather around and hear me announce something incredible, people! Gather around, will ya!”</p>\n<p>Standing on top of a table, Elder Jhamil shouted to gather people, announcing something that the Young Master of Blackwood Family passed him beforehands. “Although winner of the duel is Young Lady Bhela, Young Master Frane of Blackwood House is concerned by some stupid unruly girl of the supposed biggest family in Badril Village behavior would smear my young lady--”</p>\n<p>“Big news! Big news!” someone else’s shouting cut off Elder Jhamil’s announcement, “Young Master Bonithon is running around beating people! Watch your mouth if you don’t want get beaten for no reason!”</p>\n<p>“Bony is going crazy! He’s going to kick people’s asses! Nobody knows why!”</p>\n<p>“What the fuck is going on! Why Elzhier Family messing with us Malikhs now?”</p>\n<p>At the chaotic scene before him, Elder Jhamil’s face showed a frown and a hint of hesitation. He then cleared his phlegm anyway, trying to get people’s attention, then pushed on announcing carefully, “Young Master Frane Blackwood is concerned that--”</p>\n<p>“Elder Jhamil!!” a servant came running with a horrified expression, “Bony is coming for you, run away!”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil pointed his finger at the servant and roared, “What is that brat from Elzhier Family wants to do with me! Go kick him out, I’m trying to tell everybody something important here!”</p>\n<p>“But he doesn’t listen to reasons! He’s going to punch your face, is what he said just now!”</p>\n<p>“Imbecile! Do you think a young master would jump around like a monkey and punch an elder of another family in the damn face?! He’s making ruckus. Go on, kick him out!”</p>\n<p>Looking at the crowd from the rushedly made stage, he then smiled and continued, “Right, everybody, it’s Young Master of Blackwood Family; what I’m saying is that since Young Lady Bhela Malikh is winning with ease against the foolish young lady of <em>that</em> family, Young Master Blackwood concerned that some people would shrug my young lady’s victory. So he proposed, in order to make it clear the disparity between Malikh and--sheesh--Yashura, he proposed that him as a friendly representative of Malikh Family and Shira Yashura as the repre--”</p>\n<p>“Elder Jhamil--watch out!”</p>\n<p>He had it taking from lowly servants who cut off his announcement. Fuming in anger, Elder Jhamil pointed his finger toward the one who was spriting toward him and roared, “How many times I told you to just kick him out! Shut your trap and go kick the damned brat!”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was losing his cool. But what he failed to realize in time was that the one who sprinted toward him wasn’t a servant from his family. It was not the one who telling him to run away. And before he knew it, someone leaped up on the table where he was standing and delivered a punch to the face.</p>\n<p>“Gaaahhh!”</p>\n<p>Even after Elder Jhamil stumbled down the table he stood on, his assaulter didn’t plan to let him go. And what came after that was a torrent of hardened fist, pummeling his face even though he screamed for mercy. Only when the chaotic crowd succeeded in saving him did Elder Jhamil see the assaulter’s face--it was indeed the Young Master from Elzhier Family.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Bonithon… what did you… why did you do this… for what reason?!” Elder Jhamil choked out his grievance.</p>\n<p>Bony, the man who beat the bald elder black and blue, replied with nothing but a cold stare. Instead, it was an almost incoherent voice of Pilek who answered instead.</p>\n<p>“Kekekek, don’t be angry Elder Baldy! We just discussed how you were a splendid Pugilist a long time ago, so Boss Bony came here to find out whether it was true or not! That’s why he asked you to a barehand duel!” Pilek came in with a swagger and a bottle of booze in his hand. From a single glance anybody could tell he was drunk.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s lips trembled. What duel? That brat just leaped out of nowhere without saying anything, then immediately beating him black and blue!</p>\n<p>The only one from the three delinquents who hadn’t had the smell of liquor from his body was Polio. He wore an apologetic smile, and with a slight sigh, he said, “Please forgive them, dear kind Malikh sirs, my friends are terrible when they are drunk.”</p>\n<p>Polio made a round to apologize to any Malikhs he saw. But the Malikh Family didn’t appreciate his gesture, receiving jeerings in return.</p>\n<p>Polio was a patient young man, but Pilek wasn’t. The drunk Pilek didn’t take their attitude kindly, randomly walking to a servant, said, “Hah? What the fuck are you staring me at, you no-name Malikh servant? Wanna die, eh? Huuuraah!!!”</p>\n<p><em>Shatter!</em></p>\n<p>Without a warning he swung the booze in his hand to a Malikh family servant. The man he attacked stumbled backward holding his bloodied head from the crash Pilek gave him.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Bhela Malikh had just settled greeting four foreign guests that she invited from outside, and was on her way to fetch cuisines from the kitchen to humor her guests, then she witnessed the chaotic brawl unfold with a crowdful of cheers and jeers mixed in between. Perhaps there were more than a dozen men involved, with the Malikhs servants, guards, common family members even an elder came along to surround Bony and his two underlings.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela…” a little maidservant with a crest of Elzhier Family in her uniform bowed to Bhela politely.</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at her. She returned the bow even though the other party clearly was a servant. “Miss Elzhier,” she spoke softly.</p>\n<p>“No need to be polite to this servant, Young Lady.”</p>\n<p>“I can’t be impolite to Sister Ryntia’s friends.”</p>\n<p>The Elzhier Family maidservant smiled. Since Bhela insisted, then she wouldn’t be bowing her head anymore.</p>\n<p>She said, “Eldest Young Lady sends me to ask for your forgiveness for her brother’s brashness, Young Lady Bhela.”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at the brawl that started in her family’s courtyard. This chaos would spell imperfect on tonight's Malikh Family’s Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>“There’s no need for that. Since I accepted Young Lady Mila Yashura’s duel then I somewhat anticipated Young Master Bonithon will follow suit to make trouble tonight. If anything, it is I the one who should apologize to Sister Ryntia because I couldn’t handle the situation well. Please tell her that I’ll try to maintain friendship between Malikh and Elzhier Family.”</p>\n<p>Still with the serene smile on her face, the Elzhier Family maidservant studied the expression on Bhela’s face. She spoke a moment after, “Then I’ll let Eldest Young Lady Elzhier knows by tomorrow.”</p>\n<p>“Thanks,” Bhela offered her gratitude with a bow.</p>\n<p>By this time, the brawl became anything but intensified, as men either from Elzhier Family or thugs that previously had dealings with Bony’s group came in to reinforce the Elzhier young master. Before the Malikhs could pressure the intruders with numbers, but then the completely overwhelmed by the new reinforcement.</p>\n<p>“Huurraaahh!” Pilek sent a Malikh man flying with his kick. “Where the fuck your previous cocky taunt? Cat got your tongue, eh?”</p>\n<p>The only unspoken rules in brawls were strictly no usage of mana and spell as well as no sharp objects to use as weapons. But when it was chaotic and nobody could watch everybody the sharpest mind with tricks the one who prevailed--this is why the likes of Pilek and his friend Polio who always struck in place people wouldn’t be willing the one who were taking the advantage in brawls. Even hunters and seasoned guards were no match against these naughty brats.</p>\n<p>For example, when Pilek’s punch was blocked by Elder Jhamil’s son, “You shitty brat, just wait till I deal with your father--kuukgghh!”</p>\n<p>And because no one was watching, Pilek used his knee to strike the cocky young elder in the balls.</p>\n<p>With a sad whimper from his trembling lips, Elder Jhamil’s son curled onto the ground holding his precious balls that Polio struck.</p>\n<p>Seeing that a family elder was mercilessly defeated, a few Malikhs came to avenge their young elder. By then, Pilek already had Polio watching over his back.</p>\n<p>At that point, no Malikhs could match them in hand-in-hand brawl.</p>\n<p>A stranger then casually walked in. Pilek stopped, looking at him, and amidst the chaotic scene it took a while for him to find out that the man was actually a foreigner--an eastern Kaya man. The man had a sheathed sword on his hips. But Pilek wasn’t afraid as long as he stick with the brawl rules to use only fighting unarmed.</p>\n<p>“Huurraaah!”</p>\n<p>Pilek threw a feint. Most simple Malikhs would fall for this. But the eastern Kaya man didn’t budge. Seemed to even anticipate it. With a movement too fast for Pilek to follow the man grabbed his wrist, flicked him and sent him into the air like it was nothing.</p>\n<p>It was only after Pilek rolled in the mud he realized what had happened.</p>\n<p>The man then glanced aside and walked toward Polio who in his own right was too engrossed with the brawl. With his left hand pushing Polio’s shoulder and the other hand grabbing his wrist, he flipped Polio just like he did Pilek beforehand.</p>\n<p>Pilek and a few others that the man previously flipped were amazed by how effortlessly the man disabling enthusiastic young men from fighting.</p>\n<p>The sword handle the man had was wrapped with cloth and its body too thin for regular blades. Those who noticed this would understand that the man wasn’t an ordinary Kaya. Polio was one of them.</p>\n<p>“A Samurai!” he exclaimed a moment after he got thrown onto the muddy ground.</p>\n<p>The Kaya man stopped, looking at him, then spoke with a displeased tone, “I am but a masterless ronin.”</p>\n<p>The man then continued walking toward a different direction.</p>\n<p>Bony was fighting with three men alone, so he couldn’t afford to look around. He didn’t realize the Kaya man at first, but when the man tried to grab the wild young master’s wrist, Bony reacted--he reacted by throwing a punch to the man’s face.</p>\n<p>The man slapped his flying fist from the side, tremendously muffled its momentum. Again, he tried to grab Bony’s wrist and his shoulder. Bony tried resisting but the man’s speed was too fast for him to compete.</p>\n<p>As the man prepared to flip him, Bony felt a faint gush of the wind from his legs. It didn’t take him a second to realize the man just putting his hand on his shoulder as a feint--his real target was to gently nudge his foot on rooting from the ground, which, if he’d focus his effort to get his shoulder free from the man’s grasp, a small window of opening that could be used by his opponent to disrupt his sense of balance. Thus Bony firmly stomped his feet to the ground instead. He grabbed the man’s sleeve to make his opponent not be able to easily throw like Pilek and Polio.</p>\n<p>Responding to Bony’s choice, the man curled the corner of his lips. Bony caught a hint of taunt when he staring the man in the eyes.</p>\n<p>“Kkuuuggghh!”</p>\n<p>Bony did succeed in preventing himself get flipped to the ground. But he got struck in the gut instead.</p>\n<p>The man didn’t let him go. The moment Bony stepping backward due to shock having stricken, the man was charging and got his wrist in the blink of the eyes--what happened afterward was Bony got his feet swept and he completely lost his ground, and got cheered by his friends as the last man who got thrown into the mud.</p>\n<p>Bony then sat there looking as the fight stopped; since someone took him down, more and less the Malikhs had won the brawl.</p>\n<p>“Aren’t you Thoqek’s son?” the Kaya man asked Bony.</p>\n<p>Bony wasn’t willing to open his mouth when his father’s name got mentioned.</p>\n<p>Receiving no answer, the man thus carelessly said, “Unexpectedly, you’ve got more guts than your father. Get up now, and stop making trouble in Ghalim Malikh’s home.”</p>\n<p>The young ruffians with Bony as the leader naturally wouldn’t be arrogant anymore since they had been defeated. They retreated calmly, and the Malikhs didn’t dare taunt them the second time in case Bony would change his mind and started on a rampage again. In the end, the real reason why Bony came targeting Malikh Family, as many people knew, was that he wasn’t a drinker that would lose reason to punch another family’s elder in the face.</p>\n<p>Speaking about an elder who got a punch in the face; after Bony and others were gone, Elder Jhamil showed his nose out of his hiding place. He gritted his teeth. He swore he’d use his full resource to get back from Bony’s father in the next village council meeting.</p>\n<p>“Elder Jhamil, you still haven’t announced the thing I ask you to do,” from behind, the sullen young noble Frane Blackwood said to him.</p>\n<p>“Y-young Master Blackwood, please spare me--the mood isn’t that good to draw people’s attention after that kid crashing our Ngajen Ceremony just now. How about I brief it to other village leaders tomorrow in the village council meeting?”</p>\n<p>“No, I want everyone to know it by tonight. This is the right time and the right place to announce it. Besides, I want to see what kind of a young man the one who’s supposed to be my rival.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil didn’t want to show his beaten face to the crowd tonight. But as much as he love his face he knew flattery wouldn’t get him out of this situation--at least not if he didn’t want to offend the young noble. And so with a heavy face he climbed the table once again, hiding off his reluctancy.</p>\n<p>Someone heartily made a joke on him, “Elder Jhamil, we thought you’re a man who care about face the most--I don’t expect you to boldly show how handsome you’ve become now!”</p>\n<p>“Kids nowadays getting big headed by their privileges as young masters--naturally I’ll let their fathers know how to discipline their brats!” Elder Jhamil coldly said. “Anyway, you all know that my Young Lady Bhela is a girl with talent and her future is boundless. Here in Malikh Family we’re not willing to throw our princess to cow’s dunk that is Yashura Family’s trash young master. And our friend Young Noble Frane Blackwood also thinks the same!”</p>\n<p>Such passionate speech, naturally people were cheering in anticipation of the next spectacle they thought they were going to witness.</p>\n<p>Getting the cue from Elder Jhamil, Frane Blackwood came forward with a swagger. “I speak this as a close friend of Young Lady Bhela Malikh. Someone with the name of Shira Yashura; if you think you’re worthy of her, do you dare to prove it by having a duel with me?!”</p>\n<p>The crowd was silent. They were waiting for the reply.</p>\n<p>Frane Blackwood swept the crowd with his eyes.</p>\n<p>Someone said to him the boy he challenged was utter trash. He was amused guessing how this trash would respond to his duel challenge, especially when Bhela Malikh had just completely defeated the cheeky young lady from his family.</p>\n<p>There were already murmurs spreading. People were also curious whether Shira was going to accept or run away from it.</p>\n<p>And then…</p>\n<p>“<em>Cough, cough…</em>” someone awkwardly stepped forward with a wry smile plastered on his face. People recognized his face, which looked like a monkey, and many of them had seen him together with Shira Yashura.</p>\n<p>He was Monkey. He said, “This young noble… about your proposed duel… I’m afraid Young Master Shira Yashura can’t answer it tonight.”</p>\n<p>Frane Blackwood laughed. “Why? He’s scared? His cousin challenged Young Lady Bhela to a duel for no apparent reason; don’t tell me we can do the same to them?”</p>\n<p>“No, it’s not that.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil pointed his finger at Monkey. “We all know Shira Yashura is a trash who can’t even advance to Level 4 Novice! Young Master Frane Blackwood is kind. Tonight, he’s going to give Shira one chance to admit that he’s unworthy of Young Lady Bhela Malikh to the crowd here. He does that, and there will be no need for Young Master Frane Blackwood to embarrass him by kicking his ass!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, but he can’t give you an answer tonight,” Monkey insisted.</p>\n<p>Now it was Elder Jhamil who laughed. “He’s really scared facing Young Master Frane right now?!”</p>\n<p>“No…”</p>\n<p>“Then why?”</p>\n<p>Monkey sighed.</p>\n<p>“Because he’s already gone home!”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was furious. The whole point he had to gather people even though his face had been beaten by Bony was to call out the boy and embarrass him in public, as per the young noble request. But the said person himself already went home, so Elder Jhamil standing on top of the table was for nothing.</p>\n<p>Immediately he ordered a servant to send the message to Yashura Family, while in between, cursing the fact that he didn’t get the chance to distract the guests from discussing the previous brawl. Sure enough, not only the people were talking about Bhela Malikh’s hidden Unique Class, they were also talking about Bony, and people he beat to pulp, especially Elder Jhamil. People no longer cared to gossip about Young Lady Mila Yashura who had been sent home defeated, but they laughed at someone present who had just his misfortune like Elder Jhamil instead.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil had lost his face in the end. Literally and metaphorically.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, with a solemn expression Monkey looked at his partner Snake who was enjoying the banquet and had amused himself watching the spectacle previously.</p>\n<p>Monkey said with a whisper, “Why the hell your family doesn’t show his face when they dumping shit to Young Master and Young Lady Yashura just now?!”</p>\n<p>Snake glanced at him lazily. “I don’t know. They said they were going to diagnose Patriarch Ghalim Malikh previously.”</p>\n<p>“Can’t you just fetch your brother instead? Didn’t you put your words to assure young master before this? What if he thinks we’re people who put our words lightly?”</p>\n<p>“The one who’s diagnosing the patriarch is my grandfather, my brother supposed to be free enough to be a busybody just now,” Snake said, displeased by Monkey’s tone accusing him of being unloyal to his own word.</p>\n<p>Actually, he also confused why his brother didn’t show his nose when Young Lady Mila recklessly brought a sword to challenge Bhela to a duel. From his understanding of his brother’s character and the relationship between his family and Yashura from what he knew told him that more or less his brother was going to back Yashura if the drama with Malikh Family intensified. But he didn’t. Snake would barge into Malikh Family’s doors to look for his grandfather if he knew it was going to be like this instead.</p>\n<hr>\n","unregistered":[]},"novels/yashura-legacy/contents/volume-1/chapter-5.md":{"contributions":{},"lastModified":1604638175869,"data":{"title":"Hidden Power in Yashura Family"},"body":"<authors-note id=\"Radhy\" type=\"danger\">\n<p>I don’t recommend reading from here onwards because the chapter below is still from the previous draft, which is different from the previous 4 chapters. Further edits will be made that most likely makes this chapter quite different than the current one.</p>\n</authors-note>\n<p>In a certain hall in Malikh Family’s left wing complex, four people sat idly on the bamboo mats covered floor. They were being served local-specialty ginger drinks mixed with brown sugar with herbs to drink. There were also some roasted peanuts to chew. Despite they dressed humbly when attending the Ngajen Ceremony, three of them were elders with statuses, while one of them, the sword bearing Kaya man, wasn’t anyone to ignore either.</p>\n<p>Having knowing this, they still waiting for their host, Bhela Malikh, to wrap up the Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>“Still,” Madame Sylvia said after a sip of ginger drink, “I wouldn’t have expected the girl’s talent to be that rare when she approached my sect with the invitation. The top brass only interested of her being the top grade during the seminar thus sent me to check her out. How about you, Mister Harrington?”</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t expecting it either. I only interested when the report said she showed a potential of being two elemental-affinities Archer. Three already great, but with four elementals, chances she’ll get her name down in history books.”</p>\n<p>“That is what happen if she able to live long enough to develop her full potential,” the quiet man with sharp aura remarked. His face was thin, rough, and since he never liked to smile, he always looked like he meant business. The man was role model of eastern Kaya race ancient warriors--stand and sit in straight posture, humorless, and most importantly, always bringing the sharp, thin sword of katana on his hips.</p>\n<p>Madame Sylvia was interested on his remark. So she asked, “Oh, why you think of that, Sir Kurusiya?”</p>\n<p>The eastern man replied, “Because she tangled herself with Blackwood Family,” he paused. “If this Blackwood the same one from this Blackwood guy I know, then it’s definitely a bad news for her.”</p>\n<p>Mister Harrington from Elemental Stone School disagreed.</p>\n<p>“Since when our factions become soft?” he questioned. “We’re not that pitiful to handle some second-rate noble family. Honestly, I think that young man from that Blackwood Family such a pest. If Young Lady Bhela asks for my favor, I’ll handle him cleanly and thoroughly--right here, right now.”</p>\n<p>“I’m not talking about Blackwood Family, I’m talking about the creepy guy with Blackwood as his last name,” Sir Kurusiya said as he put down his ginger drink. He wasn’t happy, so Madame Sylvia signaled Mister Harrington that it best not to continue arguing with the scary eastern Kaya man.</p>\n<p>The hall suddenly turned quiet. Then, the fourth man was happily enjoyed his drink, out of the blue he blurted for his opinion that no one asked for. “That boy from Yashura Family is sure interesting…”</p>\n<p>Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia smiled wryly. Nobody said anything about Yashura Family up until now. The fourth man, Baront Staterwind, came from a very peculiar faction. Which actually had nothing to do with Bhela’s type of talent. Even when he had already came to Badril Village, none would think he accepted Bhela Malikh’s invitation just to scout her talent.</p>\n<p>The hall’s door was knocked. Bhela entered. She politely greeted the four respected guests before she sat down.</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry for the wait, dear elders. Malikh Family hasn’t prepared the best dishes for you during the ceremony, so I asked the best chef we have to cook special meals for you,” Bhela said, then she glanced at the door. “Please enter, aunty!”</p>\n<p>The moment she called, a middle-aged woman who helped Bhela in the kitchen before came with a line of maidservants, bringing freshly cooked dinner meals with them. It was better than what the Malikhs served for the guests before, even compared to the meals served for the family’s important guests cooked by Bhela as the chief chef.</p>\n<p>“I rather you serve me some alcohol,” the eastern Sir Kurusiya said to her.</p>\n<p>Bhela nodded at his request and asked the aunty to fetch the best alcohol she could find. Of course, the best person to get help was the elder who provided Bhela with the hall to host her guests. Bhela hoped the said elder already knew the importance of this meeting thus not being stingy with his alcohol collection.</p>\n<p>“Can we start now, young lady? I don’t have a good alcohol tolerance so I rather get this completed before us adults get to drink,” Madame Sylvia said.</p>\n<p>“We have delicious food here served, Madame Sylvia. To be honest, all the wait before is for the aunties preparing dinner for dear elders,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>But not of the adults believed her words easily.</p>\n<p>“Hoho, you seem so nervous, young lady. You might not look like it, but you seem about to cry,” Sir Baront Staterwind said.</p>\n<p>“Just state what you want from us, don’t waste anymore time,” Sir Kurusiya urged.</p>\n<p>Bhela lowered her head. With her lips tremblingly parted, she said, “As you might know, my father fell ill when I was overseas attending the seminar. My mother has contacted many doctors and alchemists to make medicines for him, yet my father’s condition never improved. I request for elders’ wisdom and strength, please help my poor father, he was in misery for months…”</p>\n<p>Bhela prostated.</p>\n<p>“Please, help me father… he’s dying… please…” she begged.</p>\n<p>Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia exchanged glances. The peculiar beardy man, Sir Baront, merely nodded without letting his thoughts known. Meanwhile, Sir Kurusiya, who didn’t bulge seeing the pretty girl begging in front of him, coldly said, “Well, this is really a waste of time.”</p>\n<p>Hearing the eastern man snorted, Bhela’s heart went cold. She prepared herself bowing down for help, without stating a single offer to prove how desperate herself.</p>\n<p>“And, young lady…” Madame Sylvia asked slowly, “what would you do if someone managed to heal your father?”</p>\n<p>Bhela rose up. She looked straight to Madam Sylvia’s gaze, then said, “Anything,”</p>\n<p>“Anything?”</p>\n<p>“Anything.”</p>\n<p>The room went quiet. Only Mister Harrington’s regretful sigh could be heard.</p>\n<p>It was Sir Baront Staterwind who explained with a good intention, “It really seems you haven’t grasped the situation you were in, young lady. The guest who gave you the gift from before, he’s a young master of a family known as the peerless medicine makers and doctors. If they couldn’t cure your father illness, then I believe no one in this room knows who really can.”</p>\n<p>“If I had a petty mind, young lady, I’d kill for the cosmetic you got from them. That’s how valuable their skills are,” Madam Sylvia said as she shook her head in pity.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh bit her lips. She was eloquent when she invited these experts months ago. Yet tonight, she had completely became tongue-tied and defeated. The cold air suddenly felt more unbearable. Although the warm meals’ delicious aroma wafted through the hall, not a single person had any incentive to touch their food. Everyone in the hall sunken into silence.</p>\n<p>“You want my advice, young lady?” the sharp voice of Sir Kurusiya sliced through the awkward atmosphere. He continued, “Having turned your back against Yashura Family is the dumbest decision you did. I didn’t come here because of you. I know your father, and I certainly know that swordsman from Yashura Family more. It’s a pity I couldn’t meet them today. Really, a complete waste miles and miles of journey.”</p>\n<p>With that, Sir Kurusiya, stood up and prepared to leave.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh quickly swallowed her bitterness, also stood up and said, “Please, Elder Kurusiya, let me see you the way out.”</p>\n<p>“No, don’t,” Sir Kurusiya flatly rejected her offer. “Sit down. These three fogies still haven’t decided what they want to do with you. Better think carefully about what you’re going to say to them next.”</p>\n<p>The eastern man saw himself out. Following his suggestion, Bhela Malikh sat down again and faced the three experts, with her mind suddenly became as blank as a barren field in the corner of abandoned land. She didn’t know what she ought to say to them, seeing the looks of pity they directed at her. Then, just when she managed to regain her bravery to say something, the door slammed open--</p>\n<p>“I come as the representative of Blackwood Family!” Young Master Frane Blackwood boldly yelled.</p>\n<p>He swagered himself in along with Elder Jhamil’s son and the adjutant of Blackwood Family under his wings. The arrogant behaviour of this young noble completely disregard the experts in the room. Madame Sylvia had enough. She dissed him, “What are you doing here uninvited?”</p>\n<p>Instead of the adjutant who usually spoke for his young master, it was the young elder of Malikh Family, Elder Jhamil’s son who replying. “This madam has eyes but doesn’t know what good for her. Of course Young Master Blackwood is invited! He’s the special guest of Malikh Family after all!”</p>\n<p>“What’s your name, boy?” the middle-aged woman hissed.</p>\n<p>“I’m Elder Jhamil’s eldest son! What’s up with you, you don’t have the right to know my name!”</p>\n<p>“Is that it? Very well. It seems just because I respect the southerner custom by dressing commonly you ignorant people already forgot what's best for you. Very well!”</p>\n<p><em>Zziiing!</em></p>\n<p>With a flashing draw of metallic sword, Madame Sylvia stood up to give this ignorant young elder a lesson. But her companion Mister Harrington quickly pulled her back before things really blown up.</p>\n<p>“You brought a weapon with you!” the Elder Jhamil’s son screamed with his finger pointing at Madame Sylvia who already trembling holding back her fury. “Do you not know what’s gonna happen to guests who bring weapons inside their host’s home?”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood rolled his eyes and told his adjutant, “Send this toad out of here, he’s too noisy!”</p>\n<p>“Right away,” the adjutant said. Then with his bony hands, he pulled the screaming Elder Jhamil’s son forcefully.</p>\n<p>“Is the discussion still ongoing?” Frane Blackwood asked the sitting guests as he tightened the blue necktie he wore. He said to Bhela, “Blackwood Family offers a lifetime terms of benefit for you, young lady. Not only medicines, if it boost potion you ask, or equipments, magic items, weapons--you name it, we have all things you’d dare to imagine!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho,” his uninvited offer gave Sir Baront Staterwind a chuckle. The three guests Bhela invited hailed from their own factions, so even if they wanted to rope Bhela in, they would consult with their higher ups about the specific terms they’d give to her as benefits. However, Blackwood Family was, in fact, only a noble family, not an organizational faction, with the only way in was through marriage--so of course the young noble would be able to offer a “lifetime benefits” to her so brazenly.</p>\n<p>“Thank you for holding back your anger, Madame Sylvia,” Bhela completely bowed her head to the angry guest while she completely disregarded Young Master Blackwood’s offers.</p>\n<p>Madame Sylvia nodded. She then looked at Young Master Blackwood and snorted. “Young lady, think carefully about what we said before. Some incapable people only able to spout honey trap to get what they want. Don’t be foolish because your father’s situation.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you for the advice…”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood wanted to argue with this lady. But he also held himself back as he didn’t know the other party’s identity. Therefore, all he could do was haughtily smiling elegantly as a proper noble as he was.</p>\n<p>“Has the discussion already started?” Frane Blackwood asked again. Pity him, not even one interested in answering. Because of that his face became red as he fumed with anger.</p>\n<p>“Ah,” Sir Baront Staterwind looked outside the window and slapped his thigh, “look how late it is! I planned to sleep early because I have something I need to do tomorrow early in the morning!”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh quickly offered to see him till the gate.</p>\n<p>“Hoho, how about you two?” Sir Baront asked the last two foreign experts, the pair of middle-aged man and woman, “overstaying your visit is considering a burden to these good Mossack folks, don’t you think so?”</p>\n<p>“I’m but an ignorant western lady, I know little about the way of the southern people, so please don’t mind us being shameless,” Madame Sylvia said. She then looked at Bhela, “Young Lady Bhela, Mister Harrington and I apparently haven’t booked our place in the village’s inns. We don’t know our talks would turned out dragged this late. For this I have to beg you to let us stay in Malikh Family for a few good days.”</p>\n<p>“Hoho…” Sir Baront Staterwind chuckled as he looked at the poker face pair of experts. Wasn’t the four of them--including Sir Kurusiya, checked in the same inn this afternoon? It was clear Madame Sylvia and Mister Harrington had their own intentions, thus Sir Baront Staterwind shrugged the idea of exposing their little white lies.</p>\n<p>And with that, Bhela Malikh led the three expert guests she invited out of the room. Young Master Blackwood, who was ignored so hard she almost exploded, yelling, “Young Lady Bhela!”</p>\n<p>Bhela turned around. “Yes, Young Master Blackwood?”</p>\n<p>“How about me?”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh blinked. Then she picked a bowl of roasted peanuts and approached him, saying softly, “Please sit down and enjoy this snack. I need to attend to my guests.”</p>\n<p>Hearing her soft, yet slightly cold voice, Young Lady Blackwood the understood something that made him excited, so excited he obediently sat down and nimbled on the roasted peanuts the beautiful Young Lady Bhela gave him.</p>\n<p>Then after Bhela brought the guests out, the Blackwood Family adjutant who was waiting outside came in inside the hall.</p>\n<p>“What are you doing?!” Young Master Blackwood hissed.</p>\n<p>The adjutant gawked. “Young master, I’m here to serve you…”</p>\n<p>“Serve me?” the young master cringed. What a joke! Soon he’d have a time being alone with Young Lady Bhela, and this old man wanted to be here right when he had the chance of his lifetime? What if there--during the discussion--was an accident where he had to be responsible as a man? Would he be happy if the adjutant was here when that happened?</p>\n<p>Absolutely not!</p>\n<p>“Get out! Don’t dawdle around here tonight! I need to discuss an important manner with Young Lady Bhela secretly!”</p>\n<p>“Y-young master--”</p>\n<p>“What are you waiting for! Go back to the inn and don’t bother me till the next morning!”</p>\n<p>The adjutant naturally understood what was inside the young master’s mind. He didn’t dare to linger around. With careful steps, he closed the door and went back to the inn Blackwood Family checked in.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Young Master Blackwood was so excited he couldn’t sit calmly alone in the hall. The thought of having private discussion with a girl as pretty as Bhela Malikh made him thinking a lot of things. Slowly, he getting horny.</p>\n<p>“What is taking her so long?” he mumbled to himself after waiting a fruitless thirty minutes. “Is it maybe she needs to… prepare, herself?”</p>\n<p>If it was going to be her first time, of course she needed time to prepare herself, Young Master Blackwood thought. This young noble had “befriend” and participating in “private discussions” with many experienced women. But virgin girls, he never tasted any.</p>\n<p>Because of that, he willing to wait however much longer for the young lady to prepare herself. And thus, after waiting for another thirty minutes, nothing happened. Nothing happened for the next hour as well. Then, after waiting for nearly three hours alone, the door finally opened…</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela, you finally ready!” Young Master Blackwood snapped out of his sleepy face and excitedly came to greet the visitor. Much to his disappointment, the visitor turned out to be the faithful adjutant.</p>\n<p>“Why is that you?!” Young Master Blackwood roared.</p>\n<p>“Y-young master… let’s get back to the inn,” the adjutant nervously asked.</p>\n<p>“Where’s Young Lady Bhela?”</p>\n<p>“She is in her room…”</p>\n<p>“Then you send someone there to ask her when she’s going to meet me,” the young noble ordered.</p>\n<p>“I’m afraid I can’t… young master…”</p>\n<p>“I’ve been waiting for hours, why?”</p>\n<p>The adjutant gulped before he replied.</p>\n<p>“Because the young lady has already gone sleeping since three hours ago!”</p>\n<p>So much for his dreamy private discussion! Young Master Blackwood was so angry for being misled that he slapped the adjutant’s face all the way back to his inn.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A single torch on a stick stubbornly lit the corner of the village in spite of the strong wind. A howling wolf in the distance reinforced the lone, cold sense of the midnight Badril Village. The only shop that still open at this hours could be counted with one hand, and this liquor shop was one of them. No customer visited it except a foreign eastern Kaya man.</p>\n<p>A series of step could be heard. The sleepy shopkeeper snapped back when he heard a new customer approaching.</p>\n<p>“Give me a glass of <em>tuak</em>, shopkeeper,” the new customer ordered with a booming voice. One could see his beardy feature when his face exposed to the shop’s lantern light. “Mind if I join you, Sir Kurusiya?”</p>\n<p>The eastern man didn’t reply. He drank his alcohol instead.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront Staterwind laughed by his cold treatment. The beardy guy was an easygoing person, so he casually grabbed a bowl of steamed peanuts and started to nibble on those snacks.</p>\n<p>“You’re not visiting Bhela’s father? You said you know him, you know, saying hi to a sick old buddy?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t say hi to a dying man,” Sir Kurusiya said.</p>\n<p>The answer made the air awkward. So Sir Baront quickly came with another topic.</p>\n<p>“It seems those two lovers adamant to protect the girl,” he said, referring to the other two experts who once were couple before Mister Harrington lost Madame Sylvia to another guy. “Or I think they just want some privacy to have some little reunion… who knows?”</p>\n<p>Sir Kurusiya never bothered with petty gossip, he callously replied, “They don’t know Malikh Family. They can’t protect her forever.”</p>\n<p>“Exactly,” Sir Baront Staterwind agreed. After that both men continued drinking without saying anything.</p>\n<p>“Hey shopkeeper,” Sir Baront called, “don’t you have anything with less alcohol? I have a business I’d like to deal with tomorrow, so I want to avoid shitty hangover.”</p>\n<p>“I have some sweet <em>tuak</em>,” the shopkeeper poured a new bottle into Sir Baront’s empty glass, “this one usually for them boys who haven’t gone coming of age ceremony. No alcohol, costs as little as four copper kobe coins.”</p>\n<p>“Four coppers, ah! Why’s that the souther I go the cheaper the drink?” he sipped it, “mm! Pretty good, my good man!”</p>\n<p>He tipped the shopkeeper with a silver coin. The shopkeeper was dumbfounded but quickly recovered and hid the coin safely.</p>\n<p>Sir Kurusiya said to Sir Baront, “You want to go to Yashura Family tomorrow?”</p>\n<p>“How did you know?”</p>\n<p>“Even though I can’t see him, I know the one who repelled Bhela’s arrow was a Nalaq,” Sir Kurusiya said.</p>\n<p>“Hoho, since I managed to rope in the young lady of Yurin Family, I’ve got promoted to an instructor,” Sir Baront smiled widely. “Doing the legwork isn’t my job anymore… but checking him and the boy won’t hurt, so I’m going. Hmm, I wonder if the Nalaq has already form his contract?”</p>\n<p>“Huuh…” the shopkeeper, who had been hearing their chatting, couldn’t help but asked, “you good sir, what’s this talking about a Nalaq having to do with Yashura Family?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, you’re a Yashura?” Sir Baront asked.</p>\n<p>“I’m Elzhier, from the outer family,” the shopkeeper said. “I’ve been in this village for forty years, but never I’ve heard any Nalaq passing by.”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, that’s why I’m going. Usually a rogue Nalaq isn’t someone tied with a faction, so they aren’t that big of deal--which also make them easier to rope in!”</p>\n<p>“Ooohh! Are you a Nalaq expert, mister? From overseas? Our family’s eldest young lady actually was scouted by a passing expert from overseas too, an expert from purple something sect!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, you mean Purple Garden Sect?” Sir Baront Staterwind and asked as he played along.</p>\n<p>But Sir Kurusiya was sceptic. “Purple Garden Sect is too far. And someone from that kind of superpower faction won’t be too idle to accidentally passing by on this kind of rural village.”</p>\n<p>Sir Baront nodded at Sir Kurusiya’s logic. Even if it was that particular sect that accepted the said young lady, both experts wouldn’t be too sure about whether she could be the sect’s legitimate disciple. Their doubts made the shopkeeper embarrassed. Since ten years ago, the tales of the eldest young lady of Elzhier Family being accepted by a foreign expert was a legend amongst Badril Village locals. Except her and the recent Malikh Family’s young lady, no one in the village was lucky got scouted to study oversea, so it became a fact that Elzhier Family was very proud of--and was one of the reasons why the Elzhier could win the village head’s seat from Yashura Family after their decades of leading Badril Village. But the problem was, in the letters their young lady sent home, she always talked about shops, fashions, and some other trivial stuffs that usually young women her age excited about. That made even her father, the current Elzhier Family’s patriarch and the Village Head, felt it was became difficult to still boasting the young lady’s status after ten years of her spending overseas.</p>\n<p>“But still, experts, you might not know this, but our eldest young lady was Young Lady of Malikh Family’s closest childhood friend! When Young Lady Bhela Malikh only a little girl our young lady gave her a lot of pointers and knowledge, so much that I assure that if it wasn’t for her being there for Young Lady Bhela, the Malikh Family wouldn’t get their talented Unique Class for at least the next one hundred years!”</p>\n<p>“Right…” Sir Baront became awkward instantly. To think some ignorant folks believed blessing of Unique Classes was that simple, even Sir Kurusiya scoffed at the idea.</p>\n<p>The shopkeeper’s face became red as he realized it was wise not to delay any longer. So he quickly said, “If you have some spare time, sir experts, I’m sure our Elzhier Family willing to entertain you!”</p>\n<p>After paying for their drinks, even the agreeable Sir Baront Staterwind felt it was very awkward for him to return to this little shop. Both decided not to get themselves involved with Elzhier Family after the shopkeeper’s little salesman talks, whilst not knowing the inn they stayed inn owned by Elzhier Family.</p>\n<p>On the way back, Sir Baront asked Sir Kurusiya for advice.</p>\n<p>“Yo, Kurusiya, I’m going to accept the Yashura boy as my third disciple if the Nalaq’s pretty good. But, you know, the Nalaq who contracted with youngest disciple is a master thirteen thousands years ago. She was a heavy weight figure, so I reckon I’ll let her calls the shot. What’s your opinion on this?”</p>\n<p>“How powerful is this Nalaq you’re talking about?”</p>\n<p>Sir Baront grinned. “You know the legend about Seven Pillars of Tiramikal Continent? She’s the Frost Mage mentioned in that history. Pretty neat, huh? She was able to revive as Nalaq and regained her consciousness five years ago. All the big shots in my Blue Robe Society can’t wait for the girl she’s contracted with to formally accepted into our faction.”</p>\n<p>“If that’s the case then your disciple isn’t necesserily worse than Malikh’s four elemental Archer girl.”</p>\n<p>“So you know why I can’t accept the boy if he’s too crude--I can’t afford to offend this madam Nalaq even the slightest bit.” he took out a bag of roasted peanuts he bought from the shopkeeper, and started to nibble on them. “I’m going to write a letter to my disciples, they’ve been playing around in the neighboring village. This madam Nalaq will come and check the boy herself.”</p>\n<p>Sir Kurusiya abruptly stopped his steps.</p>\n<p>“You want my advice?” he looked straight at Sir Baront’s eyes. “My advice is simple. You’re going to make this madam Nalaq of yours polite and you’re going to beg her to be mindful of her attitude in front of Yashura Family.”</p>\n<p>“You’re joking? You serious?”</p>\n<p>“I’m always serious,” Sir Kurusiya said.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Patriarch of Yashura Family, Shuro Yashura, was exhilarated to see Grandpa Piss and Snotty came to visit the village. One part because he treasured the friendships between their family and Grandpa Piss’s relatives, but mainly, he got to show-off his latest coconut cake recipe.</p>\n<p>“Ah, this is life, drinking <em>tuak</em> when we’re watching the moon, getting drunk while we’re eating coconuts. What a life!” Patriarch Shuro mumbled.</p>\n<p>“What a life indeed,” Grandpa Piss nodded with a low chuckle. On the sky, the full moon was shining bright really beautiful.</p>\n<p>After he’d done his part in ngajen ceremony, Patriarch Shuro Yashura accompanied the old Alchemist and his grandson in a spacious veranda, where they ate coconut cakes and drinking _tuak _while spending time moongazing. They had the Yashura Family’s sole butler, Yulong, to hold the _tuak _bottle and refilled their cups when empty.</p>\n<p>“Grandpa Piss, why didn’t you tell us beforehand before you visit Badril Village? We ran out of <em>rendang</em> before even the ceremony ended, so I’m sorry if you couldn’t eat <em>rendang</em>!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, we already ate chicken curry in Malikh Family, you don’t have to prepare food for us,” Grandpa Piss said.</p>\n<p>“How about breakfast? Are we still have leftover chickens, Yulong?”</p>\n<p>“We still have some leftover grilled village chicken, I’ll talk with the kitchen to reheat two portion first thing in the morning,” Yulong said.</p>\n<p>The Yashura Family’s patriarch was a role model of the stereotype Mossack people. He loved to cook and loved even more to feed people. It was no wonder why southern Mossacks’ visitors always felt welcomed whenever they visited the southern lands.</p>\n<p>“I sent them to bring <em>rendang</em> to Malikh Family, I never expected something like that to happen, hah!” Patriarch Shuro shook his head with a weak smile plastered on his face. During their talk, Grandpa Piss mentioned they met with Shira and Mila, as well mentioned the duel that happened between the two families’ young ladies and the upcoming duel between Shira and the young noble from Blackwood Family. “Whatever, if jerks wanted to fight with us, we won’t back down. Yashura Family never a coward!”</p>\n<p>“I believe Young Master Shira knows what he has to do,” Grandpa Piss assured.</p>\n<p>“I hope so, pity his father never around to hold the sky falling for him,” Patriarch Shuro gulped his <em>tuak</em>. “Anyway, let’s talk about something else. That Ghalim, you checked on him, Grandpa? What’s happened to him?”</p>\n<p>Snotty a little scared when Shuro Yashura suddenly brought up that topic. Snotty glanced at Butler Yulong’s wrinkled face, Yulong smiled back at him. The big muscle man couldn’t help but shuddered inside.</p>\n<p>“Patriarch Ghalim isn’t feeling well after eating some unhygienic food. I already prescribed some medicine for him, but I don’t know when he’d be able to get back at being patriarch since his digestive system was never good.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, is that so? Never knew he had something like that,” Patriarch Shuro mumbled. “There’s this really bad rumor about him being poisoned, Grandpa Piss, we never had something wicked like that in Badril Village.”</p>\n<p>“No, no no no, I can assure you, it’s not poison. I’ve been in the business more than seventy years--it’s <em>not</em> a poison.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss helped Yashura Family a lot when the patriarch’s in-law, Jhuro’s wife, had Shira in her belly. So Patriarch Shuro had long esteemed Grandpa Piss’s medicinal skill, even though he didn’t really had any idea how skillful the friendly old man was. He believed Grandpa Piss in the end.</p>\n<p>“We shouldn’t talk about sad things, Patriarch. Here, I bought a <em>tuak</em> my family handmade ourself. Let’s give it a try,” Grandpa Piss said.</p>\n<p>“Please, let me,” Butler Yulong asked the <em>tuak</em> bottle Grandpa Piss took out and poured it evenly to Patriarch Shuro’s, Grandpa Piss’s, along with Snotty’s glasses.</p>\n<p>The second thing Patriarch Shuro loved, after coconuts, was a strong <em>tuak</em>. He was the first one to gulp his glass clean, and he sighed about how good Grandpa Piss’s family <em>tuak</em> craft was. However, soon after that, his eyes somehow became heavy.</p>\n<p>“Huhh… usually, I still can drink till dawn…” Patriarch Shuro said with a yawn. “Let’s drink together… come on, Snotty, come drink with Uncle Shuro more.”</p>\n<p>“Patriarch, I think you are tired,” Yulong said softly, rejecting to pour patriarch’s glass.</p>\n<p>“Snotty, you go accompany Uncle Shuro inside,” Grandpa Piss said.</p>\n<p>Snotty nodded while still holding his glass full of <em>tuak</em>. The liquor was definitely mixed with something. Considering it was his grandfather who presented it, it was amazing to see Patriarch Shuro Yashura to be able to resist the urge to sleepiness. Snotty stood up and brought the yawning Shuro Yashura away.</p>\n<p>After both of them gone, Yulong picked up a clean glass. He poured the liquor that made Patriarch Shuro sleepy and drank it for himself. Grandpa Piss took out his second bottle and accompanied Yulong drinking <em>tuak</em>.</p>\n<p>“Is there’s something you need to discuss with me?” Yulong asked.</p>\n<p>“Indeed, it’s about Ghalim Malikh’s real condition…” Grandpa Piss didn’t leave any details when he told the Butler Yulong what had really happened in Malikh Family, particularly his discovery about the true nature of poison that made Patriarch Ghalim bedridden.</p>\n<p>When he heard that shocking fact, there was no surprise in the butler’s old face. Only sorrow and regret.</p>\n<p>“I knew this would happened,” Yulong sighed.</p>\n<p>“Then there’s Blackwood Family too…” Grandpa Piss’s sigh followed. “They seems interested in taking away Young Lady Bhela as a bride… I really don’t know what to say…”</p>\n<p>Yulong drank the <em>tuak</em> and told Grandpa Piss his reasoning, “That boy from Blackwood Family still hasn’t accepted Sir Jhuro’s decission to retire sixteen years ago. He’s been keeping quiet because he knew even the royalty and the organization behind him couldn’t protect him from Old Sir Lharu’s and Old Madam Sari’s retrubution. Time’s change. I reckon there’s some change somewhere that make him cocky.”</p>\n<p>“Old Sir and Old Madam too far away to give help in case something like this happens suddenly. Should I help you and Sir Jhuro keeping tabs on Blackwood Family?” Grandpa Piss asked.</p>\n<p>While Jhuro Yashura left behind resources and men outside before he retired, he almost never interacted with the high society of nobility. For ears and eyes to reach those fancy places, it would take time and efforts for current Yulong and Shuro Yashura to do so. It was way better to ask Grandpa Piss who already familiar due to his family’s generations of Alchemist profession. However, Yulong rejected the offer without giving it a real thought.</p>\n<p>“You don’t need to worry. Blackwood Family only taking a ride of that boy’s ambition. If he really supports his foster family right from the start, Blackwood won’t be stuck with their viscount nobility rank.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss wanted to offer any more help, but he long sensed the old butler’s distrust of him on affairs that didn’t include medicines and elixirs. So he kept his mouth shut for the time being.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, a golden owl landed on the veranda where the two old men enjoyed their <em>tuak</em>. The own brought a small piece of paper and inked quill with it.</p>\n<p>“Go, send this message to Sir Jhuro, as fast as possible!” Butler Yulong said to the owl after he wrote his tiny letter. Then he glanced at Grandpa Piss and said, “this is an owl I keep around in case there’s an emergency. Sir Jhuro also brought one with him.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss nodded with a painful smile. This golden owl was long thought to be extinct, but the reality there were small amounts of them were being kept in case of emergencies. They were rare, almost becoming birds of legend. Small to medium sized kingdoms wouldn’t dare to think getting their hands on it, not to mention Grandpa Piss’s own family. But this old butler had one with him. And the prodigial man of Yashura Family casually brought this treasure bird with him to travel around the southern land.</p>\n<p>“This is really for emergency,” Yulong said coldly, knowing full well the old Alchemist’s envy.</p>\n<p>“I know, I know--for emergency.”</p>\n<p>The owl then flew away bringing Yulong’s letter.</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss and Snotty returned back to their own village the next morning. After sending them away, Yulong found out the young master, Shira Yashura, wanted to go to the market to pick some goods for his contracted pedlers to sell. He was worried the young master’s inexperience getting him exploited. Therefore, he waited in the gate and followed the boy from behind.</p>\n<p>In front of an inn owned by Elzhier Family, Yulong saw a familiar eastern Kaya man came out with a respectable, but humble Mossack man behind him. The Kaya man, Sir Kurusiya, noticed Yulong, immediately cupped his fist and bowed his body. That was a salute of great respect eastern Kaya men usually give to people they regard highly. Sir Baront Staterwind didn’t know what was going on, so he imitated his companion to salute Yulong even though he didn’t really know he was only a butler.</p>\n<p>“You know them, Yulong?” Shira asked.</p>\n<p>“The Kaya man once works in the same place as your father, young master.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, that’s why you know him.” Yulong was his mother helper, and his father brought him along to Yashura Family when Shira still in his mother’s belly. Shira never liked to listen about his father’s past, even though it was often glorified since he was completely stopped marauding bandits from approaching Badril Village. Walking toward the market, Shira kept quiet and didn’t ask the matter any further.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Far away from Badril Village, the golden owl Yulong tasked with the emergency letter flew through walls of mist and mountains. It instinctively knew the location of its recipient, Jhuro Yashura, even though Yulong wasn’t necesserarily knew where he was. Not even a half day passed by since the bird took off from Yashura Family, it flew already more than halfway toward its destination.</p>\n<p>Its speed was unprecendeted amongst the magical beast. No wonder commonfolks thought it was the bird of the legend. It was a shame that it failed to detect a single flash on the horizon, resulting it to succumb to a terrible fate.</p>\n<p><em>Flap flap flap!</em></p>\n<p>The owl futilely tried to avoid danger.</p>\n<p>A single flash all it took to capture the dumbfounded owl. A pair of cold talons gripped its short neck and the next thing it knew, the owl panically flapping its wings in search of oxygen, only to be deprived of fresh air even more. The owl couldn’t see the beast, it only saw a dashingly crimson flash before it was captured by the neck. The hostile beast scretched, only after that the owl realized a damned predator eagle already got it. Annoyed by the owl’s desperate struggle, the eagle broke its neck. The handsome crimson-colored eagle then delivered the dead owl to a mysterious masked man, who then passed it to another man--a pale, thin man who only dressed himself as black as the phantom itself.</p>\n<p>“This owl coming out from Yashura Family, Mister Blackwood. The bird brings a letter with it,” the masked man said as he presented the letter to the pale man.</p>\n<p>“Ah, so they figured it out about the poison,” the pale man with Blackwood surname said. Beside him and the masked man, there was a third man who drained the blood of the golden owl, prepared a little feast of its dead body. The man was very peculiar; bald, with veined oversized muscles that looked like it was almost exploded, and the strange tatooes that covered its body. He was a northern barbarian, the kind that never took orders from civilized men no matter they came from the west, south, or the east. Yet, when the Blackwood guy told him top plucking the dead owl, he obidiently put aside the carcass, not daring to show any hints of disatisfaction.</p>\n<p>“Mister, the young lady of Malikh Family turns out to be a four-elemental Unique Class, she’s a real talent with tremendous potential--your sister tries to take her to Blackwood Family and having a setback because there’s some experts happened to visit Malikh Family. Shall we send anymore resources to help her?”</p>\n<p>“What’s her Blackwood Family have to do with me? It’s already good enough I let her to use my name to coerce people and strengthen her influence in commerce world. She’s getting annoying every time she’s using my toys. That Jhuju’s poison I sent to her only a reminder to Ghalim of our old friendship, my sister should be thankful enough if she gets some benefits from it.”</p>\n<p>The masked man knew the pale man was irritated by his sister’s cockiness. So he excused himself and brought the crimson eagle with him, disappearing into the shadow.</p>\n<p>“We’ve rested enough,” the pale man said as he crumbled the small letter he read. The bald barbarian’s head cocked and he await the order. “Prepare the horses,” the man continued, “I’ve got an old friend I should say hi to.”</p>\n<hr>\n","unregistered":[]},"novels/yashura-legacy/contents/volume-1/chapter-6.md":{"contributions":{},"lastModified":1589309264774,"data":{"title":"Lyla Blackwood"},"body":"<p>When the news about what happened in Malikh Family’s ngajen ceremony arrived at Blackwood Family, Madam Blackwood was so enraged she broke the tea cup she held onto the floor. Establishing the family’s foot in Badril Village was supposed to be easy, but not only he failed to gain the support of Malikh Family and the villagers, the Young Master of Blackwood Family somehow managed to incite the bedridden patriarch’s supporters to regain their lost foothold against the corrupt Malikh Family’s elders.</p>\n<p>“There’s no point keeping him in that rural village,” Madam Blackwood said. She was a flamboyant, late thirty years old woman whose beauty was so superior that the previous viscount adopt her as a daughter. “Call Frane back to the city, he’s going to spend two months training in capital!”</p>\n<p>The butler who was waiting for her bowed and went away to carry out the task.</p>\n<p>“How’s Lyla’s birthday party going?”</p>\n<p>“Reply to madam, the party has started, the guests who came only from baron nobilities and mid-rank merchants,” a maid replied.</p>\n<p>The madam glanced the timid middle-aged man who sat on the same table as her. She scoffed, saying, “Look how your daughter made a name for herself. Not only the bribe money was wasted away, she coming on trips in the seminars only resulting her made a fool out of herself! Hah, like father, like daughter! Imbecile!”</p>\n<p>Madam Blackwood hurled the new cup that recently poured with hot, scalding tea. She purposely aimed at the table so the hot water splashed on the viscount’s hands. The timid viscount didn’t make a sound when his hands getting burnt, he didn’t dare to fight against his wife. It was already ten years too late for him to retaliate in any way. From the way he dragged his limping leg to fetch damp towel for his scaling skin, it was clear the waiting servants already used to ignore him.</p>\n<p>Recently, his wife’s mood had became the worst ever since their youngest daughter came back from the two years seminars. Unlike Frane--who only registered as his son by blood in papers, Lyla hadn’t show any particular talents in becoming a Class worthy of a noble family. She had a decent progress speed, a Level 7 Novice after seminars, but that progress mainly because she never had the interest to train herself. Madam Blackwood had bribed the officials so Lyla could enter the seminars supposed to boost her standing in high society, so she could catch higher ranking nobles eyes somehow. However, that plan failed in the worst way that could happen to a noble family like the Blackwood. She made blunders and broke rules so many times that she became a laughing stock. The only families that interested in her only lower rank nobles and not-so well off merchant families.</p>\n<p>“There also no point keeping that useless girl forever in the mansion,” Madam Blackwood said. “Send her to Badril Village by tomorrow. Make some smart men tending to her needs--they have to smart enough to know how to reel those Malikh villagers to say yes when I send my words in the future!”</p>\n<p>After the son’s failure, the madam would send her daughter, to do nothing but play around in Malikh Family. Even if there was something the girl could do, the madam surely wouldn’t choose this daughter of hers who she deemed too brainless to do even the simplest tasks. Her daughter was just that useless to her. The one with received the orders were people who accompanied her, who had experience in bribing and coercing. They were tasked to devour Malikh Family from the inside. The Blackwood would surely corner Bhela Malikh this time.</p>\n<p>Somewhere else, in a colorless courtyard, a birthday party already went on for about two hours. Most guests already leaving, not unlike the year before the two-years seminars happened when the sons of noble families dallying around waiting for a chance to talk with the young lady. Today, the Young Lady of Blackwood Family turned fourteen, two years before she would considered mature, but this young miss still pouting her mouth like a little girl.</p>\n<p>The old handmaid saw her young lady was bored and offered a treat.</p>\n<p>“Young lady, try this cake. A certain famous bakery made this just for your birthday.”</p>\n<p>The cake served on a small plate along with a silver fork. The girl took only mere seconds to finish it.</p>\n<p>“Is it good?” the handmaid asked.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t matter if it’s good or not, Aunt Jiji, I still hungry with this tiny minny bit of cake! Let me eat that one!” the girl pointed at the layered cake served on the center of the party.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Lyla, you can’t!”</p>\n<p>“Why can’t I?!”</p>\n<p>“You must present yourself as a proper young lady, so you can’t!”</p>\n<p>The cake was to be portioned to serve for the same amount of guests since the last party, but because the Blackwood Family’s young lady had a bad reputation in the seminars, most invited families didn’t actually come.</p>\n<p>“But I can’t be a lady if I’m hungry, am I?”</p>\n<p>“You must learn the way. Be patient, Young Lady Lyla!”</p>\n<p>“But I am huuungriiiiieeeehhh!!!”</p>\n<p>Aunt Jiji was terrified when she realized the young lady wasn’t referred only to portion of the cake, but she wanted to eat the whole cake. This shorty girl, although her feature was thin with only her cheeks got plump, actually had a talent to be a terrifying glutton that would be seen in Tiramikal Continent every one hundred years. It was a useless talent that brought only shame to Blackwood Family.</p>\n<p>It was fortunate that before the young lady could make a big ruckus, a maidservant came to bring the news about the madam’s decision. Aunt Jiji passed it to the young lady immediately.</p>\n<p>“You heard that, young lady! Madam is going to send you for a vacation!”</p>\n<p>Lyla’s head straightened, she forgot to pout. “Vacation? Where? Where where?”</p>\n<p>“To Badril Village!”</p>\n<p>“Badril Village?” the girl tilted her head. “Where’s that?”</p>\n<p>“If you promise Aunt Jiji not to eat too much cake today, Aunt Jiji will tell you where it is…”</p>\n<p>“I will if it turned out somewhere fun!”</p>\n<p>“Badril Village is where Young Lady Bhela’s home place!”</p>\n<p>“Sis Bhela’s home?!” Lyla gasped, “yahoooo!!!”</p>\n<p>Ignoring that she was the center of attention, Lyla suddenly jumped and danced like no tomorrow. Aunt Jiji tried to stop her, but it was futile since Lyla only promised not to be glutton. The remaining guests began whispering with each other. They were people who doubted the rumors about this Young Lady Blackwood, but after seeing how childish and ridiculous the girl danced, people were finally convinced. How was this a viscount’s daughter supposed to act? The girl danced her hips and hopped around like a bunny that had an itchy bum. Soon, the Young Lady Lyla Blackwood fell to the bottom list of desired young ladies to marry. Her reputation fell from not-so-smart, to stupid, and then fell again to brainless and imbecile. People didn’t see her in a good light. But that just how a girl named Lyla Blackwood really was.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Yashura Family got a peculiar visitor these past two days. He introduced himself as an expert from overseas, and somehow this foreign expert became interested in Shira Yashura. When the story leaked by insiders from Yashura Family, people were scratching their heads, wondering what could an educated man saw from this trash who could only get himself to level 3 Novice. Some people even sneered, saying that whole news was just Yashura Family’s little trick to clear up rumors from their heir’s name.</p>\n<p>“You understand, kiddo? There are three mandatory rules if someone wants to meet privately with me. First rule, it’s a <em>she</em>, not <em>he</em>. Second rule, big boobs. Third rule, in her lower part, there must be big bubbly butts, as big as her boobs. <em>Anything</em> lesser than that you can just send them back to wherever they came from.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit said that as he moved his chess piece, eating one of Shira’s pawns.</p>\n<p>“And remember, my standard is pretty high. Consult with how loadful those girls from Big-Boobed Sect are for more information,” the Nalaq continued.</p>\n<p>“Please don’t talk nonsense. I’m being serious here,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“Ey, I’m not talking nonsense. The girls from Big-Boobed Sect are real deal, okay? They’re huge! If you don’t believe me then you should go to Elzhier Family one of these days, go check out how glorious their boobs are. They always dance or become the maidservants when they’re not on duties.”</p>\n<p>“Ol’ Good-Natured Spirit… I don’t want to hear this imaginary all-woman sect of yours. Elzhier Family is only a normal rural family, they don’t host any sect members within their walls. If they did, the Village Head would boast about it at my uncle’s face every single day.”</p>\n<p>“You just don’t believe it because you never see how great they are--their boobs, I mean. How great those melons inside tight suits are! Just think about it; leather suits and melons--two entirely different things but if they come together they’d jiggling in harmony. This Good-Natured Spirit approved their sense of style.”</p>\n<p>“Forget about it, it’s not important--”</p>\n<p>“Boobs are important, ey!”</p>\n<p>Shira waved his hand as he didn’t want to continue this nonsense. He then moved a piece and finished his turn. He returned the topic back again, “The expert said he came from a first-tier faction called Blue Robe Society. If we can get his faction’s recognition then at least my family can silence all those rumors about me--especially the recent ones, they really are becoming a pain in the ass.”</p>\n<p>“I told you. I don’t talk with guys. No boobs, no good. Period.”</p>\n<p>“You are really becoming a pain in the ass,” Shira complained.</p>\n<p>After Shira said that, Good-Natured Spirit’s knight jumped over a wall of pawns to get on his bishop. Within a single breath Shira immediately moved his rook, creating a chain reaction that exposes the Nalaq’s defence, resulting his king trapped in three different direction.</p>\n<p>“Check mate.”</p>\n<p>“Ey, what the fu--” Good-Natured Spirit rage quit, flipping the chess board. “Hah! I knew it! You brat, you intentionally make me talk about boobs in order to lower my guard, right?! Fuck! That is how it is, isn’t it?!”</p>\n<p>“No, it is not.”</p>\n<p>“You sneaky bastard. You really got me,” Good-Natured Spirit threw his hands up in the air. <br>\n“Man, I surrender, that is some sick psychological tactic you got there.”</p>\n<p>“Now I don’t really know what you’re talking about.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit waved his hands in surrender, then he lit a cigarette. “Anyway, what do you want from me this time? Money again? I prepared some kobe coins enough for you to buy some candy, here, take this.”</p>\n<p>Shira shoved back the coin bag. “Not today. I just want you to meet Sir Baront Staterwind.”</p>\n<p>“No boobs, no good. Ask something else. How about I tell you the secret place where are those Big-Boobed Sect girls take their bath, ‘ey? Seems fair deal to me.”</p>\n<p>“How many times do I have to tell you--”</p>\n<p>“Sssshhh!!” Good-Natured Spirit hushed the boy. He then whispered, “you hear that?”</p>\n<p>Because the Nalaq suddenly became vigilant, Shira instinctively lowered his voice too. “Hear what?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“I heard some rats watching us…” the Nalaq covered his mouth, as if he didn’t want people to read lips what he said next, “some big-boobed rats…”</p>\n<p>“Huh… what?”</p>\n<p>“The girls from Big-Boobed Sect… they’re here…”</p>\n<p>“The heck are you talking about? This hill is Yashura Family’s property--”</p>\n<p>“Sssshhhh! They’ve noticed me noticing them. Wait here, I’mma get you some melons for your reward!”</p>\n<p>After he saying that, Good-Natured Spirit’s figure melting into the thin air.</p>\n<p>Shira Yashura sighed. At times, asking favor to this vulgar Nalaq not only difficult, it also unpredictable he’d only incite troubles if he not careful.</p>\n<p>After his winning streak for more than half a year maybe he became cocky. He forgot the Nalaq wasn’t there to solve his problem whenever he wanted, although the Nalaq sort of ended up like that after a few months he came here. Shira got some thinking, maybe he should stop seeing this Nalaq as his convenient piggy bank for his own good.</p>\n<p>“Really, he always making a mess for me to clean. I wonder if such thoughtless Nalaqs like him are common around here… now, where’s the last piece again?” he sighed for the second time.</p>\n<p>When he was picking up chess pieces that board Good-Natured Spirit flipped earlier, Shira realized there was a missing piece. Turned out it was stuck in the hole between tree roots.</p>\n<p>He plunged his hand to look for the missing chess piece.</p>\n<p>“Ugh… my fingers can’t reach.”</p>\n<p>He tried to squirm his body to fit his hand in.</p>\n<p>“Where is it again?”</p>\n<p>He frowned. He squirmed his body again really hard.</p>\n<p>“Oh, there it--”</p>\n<p><em>BOOOOOMMMMM!!!!</em></p>\n<p>An explosion happened not far away from the place he used to hang out, creating a wave of rolling dust that swept over the hill. Shira got his hand stuck between the tree rots, he could only hugged his head with his free hand and waited for the shockwave to finish. The chess pieces he gathered already nowhere to be found. He cooked up his head, looking left and right, and saw the greeny grasses were covered with dirts and trees were uprooted. The whole hill became a shithole kind of mess.</p>\n<p>Before the boy could swallow what was going on, a chuckle could be heard near him. Before him, Good-Natured Spirit emerged, coiling around the Nalaq’s body were purple-colored living flames that hungrily tried to eat him whole.</p>\n<p>As carefree as he usually was, Good-Natured Spirit said with a grin, “Those Big-Boobed Sect girls sure are feisty. They’re escaping too fast, I can’t get you melons. I managed to get a feeling of their butts, though. Here, there’s some fragrant left behind.”</p>\n<p>Shira stepped back when the Nalaq offered his palm. It was still on fire, the boy didn’t want to get burn along with him. Besides, he didn’t want to get involved with the Nalaq’s deprived hobby.</p>\n<p>“Sure you don’t want it?” Good-Natured Spirit took a last sniff from his palm, followed by a low chuckle of his.</p>\n<p>“Good-Natured Spirit… what’s that fire?”</p>\n<p>“Yeah? Dunno, man. Exorcism flame or something.”</p>\n<p>“Ohh… oh, it’s very nice to know you up until know. Good bye.”</p>\n<p>“Hmm? You want to go somewhere?” Realizing the purple flame was getting annoying, Good-Natured Spirit then patted away the coiling flame from his shoulders like it was nothing.</p>\n<p>Shira shrugged his shoulders. It seemed this bastard Nalaq was too tough for that exorcism flame. Maybe the flame was too ordinary? Whatever, he didn’t care about that anymore. His eyes then swept the ruin around him. He said, “You can’t forget about the meeting for today. But please clean the mess you made yourself.”</p>\n<p>“That’s what you want for the chess reward?”</p>\n<p>Shira nodded.</p>\n<p>“Aye, aye, will do.” Good-Natured Spirit flicked his fingers, and human-sized paper cranes came out of thin air. They were obedient, not clear whether were monsters or just magical devices. The paper cranes used magnet-like magic to carry the messy uprooted trees and boulders, along with sweeping the dirt from the grass. The cleaning up might take a while, since the hill really was a mess. Shira, feeling a little light on the head, facepalming as he returned back to Yashura Family.</p>\n<p>The whole explosion could be heard from all over Badril Village. It wasn’t clear what its cause, but Yashura Family sent guards to prevent people from knowing what really happened. In Yashura Family’s guest hall, Patriarch Shuro Yashura, a few good Yashura Family elders, and the respected visitor, Sir Baront Staterwind, forming a circle as they sat cross-legged, discussing the explosion that had just occurred.</p>\n<p>“Good elders, Sir Patriarch Yashura, I know you must get excited when I said Young Master Shira has some talent in communicating with Nalaqs. However, a Nalaq still a Nalaq. You must not offend a Nalaq whatsoever, or the consequence is dire! Young Master Shira’s life is way more important than getting a qualification to enter my school!” Sir Baront Staterwind warned. His forehead was still wet with sweat, since he hurriedly ran to Yashura Family when he realized the direction of recent explosion.</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, you’re right, Sir Staterwind. Absolutely right! I already sent someone to check on my nephew’s condition, please calm down,” Patriarch Shuro said.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront shook his head. “You don’t really know what I’m trying to say, do you? You should prepare a very good healer or a doctor, Patriarch Shuro, because if it isn’t death, one can easily lose a limb over angering a Nalaq! That happens more often than you think!”</p>\n<p>The elders drew cold breaths in unison when they heard that. Patriarch Shuro, whose face already pale, becoming even whiter than a sheet of paper. If they boy lost a limb, Shira’s chance to succeed him as the next patriarch could be swept away like specks of dust.</p>\n<p>Yulong the Butler arrived. Everyone in the room had been anxiously waiting for him they instinctively stood up when Yulong approached.</p>\n<p>“Yulong, how’s Shira doing?” Patriarch Shuro asked.</p>\n<p>Yulong replied, “Young Master Shira is back, patriarch. But Madam Yashura sent him to the kitchen for a second breakfast.”</p>\n<p>“Breakfast? What’s a breakfast has something to do with that explosion? Can he still walk?”</p>\n<p>“He’s walking fine, Patriarch Yashura.”</p>\n<p>“Then, Yulong, please go fetch my nephew for me, we have something urgent to tell him!”</p>\n<p>After his trained elegant bow, Yulong stepped back and proceeded to do the task given to him.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront Staterwind peered at the butler’s back. He traveled southern lands many times, visiting many villages, yet, he seldom heard a Mossack descent major family employed western-style butler. What made him confused even more that Sir Kurusiya apparently knew the butler and gave his respect to him, which Sir Baront Staterwind didn’t expect that coming from the cold eastern Kaya swordsman.</p>\n<p>“Dear good elder,” Sir Baront Staterwind asked a random elder who sat beside him, “may I know why there’s a butler working here?”</p>\n<p>“Is Sir referring to Yulong? Yulong isn’t actually working for Yashura Family, but Young Master Shira’s mother’s attendant. I can’t tell you the details, so forgive me sir, all I can say is Young Master Shira’s father is exceedingly brave and awesome he managed to woo a respectable lady many years ago.”</p>\n<p>“Ahhh…” Sir Baront nodded. The boy apparently a result of his parent eloping. The Blue Robe Society expert of course knew etiquette to hold himself from digging the story further.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, Yulong came back with Shira followed behind. The boy wore new clothes since his previous one was dirty. When he saw the group of elders and the expert guest looking at him, Shira sighed inside his heart. He knew he had to clean Good-Natured Spirit’s mess once again.</p>\n<p>“Greetings, elders… greetings, uncle patriarch… greetings, Sir Staterwind…”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro impatiently treading forward. “Shira my boy, is it true that you lost your limbs?”</p>\n<p>“I’m unhurt, uncle, see?” Shira waved both of his hands to prove that his limbs still functioned as they should be.</p>\n<p>“Oh! God, thank God! Really! These are really your hands, aren’t they? Not a fake one made with wood?” Patriarch Shuro Yashura grabbed his nephew hands and waved it around like a child playing with flags.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira,” Sir Baront opened his mouth, “I reckon you failed to ask the Nalaq to meet me? If you can’t do it, young master, it best for you not to push him any further. Today, you offend him and he blast the hill behind your Yashura Family as a warning, but what happens if you make the same mistake tomorrow?”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro nodded at his words vigorously. “Sir Baront is right, Shira my boy. A Nalaq is a revered being ancient Mossacks worshiped as their guardian angel. The consequence of making them mad is very dire! You should know better, my boy, you should’ve told your uncle if a Nalaq came to you the first time!”</p>\n<p>Sir Baront and his uncle Patriarch Shuro had good intentions in telling him about how to be respectful to a Nalaq. But the more Shira heard their warning, the more he doubted about Good-Natured Spirit being a “revered” Nalaq like they said. Of course, saying the truth about the explosion’s true cause resulting only Yashura Family losing face in front of Sir Baront Staterwind. Shira had no choice, he had to tread the matter very carefully.</p>\n<p>“<em>Cough, cough</em>… Uncle, Sir Baront, thank you for your concern. Truth is, it wasn’t that the Nalaq being mad that causes the explosion, but there was some… accident… that happened right before.”</p>\n<p>“With what title do you usually call him, Young Master Shira?” Sir Baront asked.</p>\n<p>“As far as I know, he doesn’t have a title. At least he didn’t tell me if he ever had one. He told me to call him ‘Good-Natured Spirit’.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, with that kind of nickname, he must be a very benevolent person when he was alive,” Sir Baront concluded as he rubbed his beard. “So, Young Master Shira, it seems he didn’t really intent to blast into smithereens.”</p>\n<p>Shira nodded. That part was true. Instead, someone else happened to be intending to blast this Nalaq into smithereens.</p>\n<p>“Thank God! Thank God! If he is a good Nalaq, maybe we don’t need to throw the second ngajen ceremony for this month, after all!” Patriarch Shuro Yashura exclaimed. The elders in the guest hall followed his exclaiming by handclapping and joyful cries. Ngajen ceremony only held once a month so the village safe from angry Selaqs, no one ever tried it to protect themselves from intelligent Nalaqs. Since the village was founded, the locals never had a Nalaq dwelling there. So it was natural for the elders to worry about throwing a ceremony they didn’t know working or not. Ngajen ceremony was expensive, after all.</p>\n<p>The more Shira saw how the previous tense hall turned jubilant and full of relieved faces, the more awkward he became. That Nalaq might call himself ‘Good-Natured Spirit’, yet he was anything but good. A low-life spirit who no doubt had been using the invisibility traits of spirits to commit many deprived crimes. He was closer to evil spirit incarnation than a good-natured one. The misunderstanding was too great his face twisted as if he’d just taste a sour lemon.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront Staterwind said, “Still, since he seems reluctant to use his old name, I reckon the Nalaq that approaching you is a low-tier one, Young Master Shira. Low-tier Nalaqs usually spirits that gain consciousness merely by luck. They don’t have factions backing them, and fortunately--in my experience--it easier to initiate negotiation with unaffiliated Nalaqs.” A hint of pride then flashed through his eyes, he continued, “my disciples will arrive tomorrow morning. One of them contracted with a high-tier Nalaq. Since the Nalaq’s mood turned sour is partly my fault, with help from the Nalaq contracted with one of my disciples, I will ask him to leave Yashura Family peacefully!”</p>\n<p>“Sir Staterwind is wise! Thank you for your concern, Sir!” Patriarch Shuro sang praises toward this expert. The elders of Yashura Family followed suit.</p>\n<p>“As expected of such expert!”</p>\n<p>“Sir Staterwind is the best of bunch of all experts that I know all my life!”</p>\n<p>“Hurray for Sir Staterwind!”</p>\n<p>They circling Sir Baront Staterwind and, not long after that, someone started to prostate. They behaved as if the guest was their one and only savior. Even Shira was getting embarrassed from seeing the scene, not to mention the already flushing Baront Staterwind.</p>\n<p>When everyone getting carried away, Shira slipped out after excusing himself. He knew he was no match for the Yashura Family’s older generations’ shamelessness. Upon walking outside, he saw Yulong was standing by the hall’s door looking galant as usual with his butler professionalism.</p>\n<p>“Can you please try to stop my uncle, Yulong? Sir Staterwind is started to get uncomfortable there.”</p>\n<p>Yulong glanced at the whole mess inside, and then he said to his young master, “I think it’s not everyday an expert coming to Yashura Family, young master, so let’s count this as Patriarch Yashura to gaining favors from a foreign expert.”</p>\n<p>“Are they really okay, though?”</p>\n<p>Yulong smiled.</p>\n<p>“Of course they aren’t, young master. But Patriarch Shuro and the family elders are honest people. Although sometimes they can be overwhelming, I’m sure Sir Staterwind can see no falsehood in their words.”</p>\n<p>Shira looked at those elders inside once again. The more he saw, the more he realized that those hysterical village men calling a man they barely knew these past two days a savior by no means a lie from their part. The elders really were freaking out when they heard the explosion. And Patriarch Shuro Yashura was the most worried of the bunch, considering him a patriarch and an uncle. Thinking about it all again, Shira couldn’t really say he still embarrassed seeing the elders spewing exaggerated flattering with straight faces.</p>\n<p>“Sir Staterwind comes from a respectable sect. Someone like that won’t get to travel the southern lands if he didn’t know the nature of the local people. So it best not to worry about it too much, young master,” Yulong said.</p>\n<p>“Really… ah, speaking of sects,” Shira deliberately changed the topic, “I heard from someone that one of the major families in Badril Village hosts members of a certain sect in secret. You’re from outside, Yulong--do you think something so outrageous like that could happen?”</p>\n<p>“Some older sects have long reaching influence, but I don’t think anyone would be interested to plant their own in Badril Village. There’s nothing valuable here for them to take notice.”</p>\n<p>“As I thought. It’s just unthinkable to think some secret powers lurking beneath our everyday lives. What if some experts actually pretending to be servants here in Yashura Family?”</p>\n<p>Although it wasn’t noticeable, Yulong’s smile became stiff.</p>\n<p>“You jest, young master. If that was true, do you think your uncle and the elders can take that kind of truth?”</p>\n<p>Following Yulong’s gaze, Shira peeped the hall and saw Sir Baront’s awkward figure, where he was in the center of Yashura Family elites--all of them-- who passionately prostrating in the floor. They practically worshipping him now.</p>\n<p>“You’re right…” Shira could only hide his face with his palm. Just when he thought he could understand them, the boy then wished he didn’t know these shameless men.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>As far as the current generation of Badril Village locals knew, they never got visited by nobles until this month Malikh Family’s ngajen ceremony happened. Everyone still talking about it.</p>\n<p>Young Master of Blackwood Family only stayed in Badril Village in one day. And the noble carriage of Blackwood Family set off out of Badril Village by noon. The next morning after the day he was gone, the two foreign guests who had been staying in Malikh Family, Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia, felt overstaying might be unnecessary, thus decided to leave too.</p>\n<p>Because the carriages going out from Badril Village mostly for public transports, Bhela personally asked an elder from his father’s faction who had a horse carriage to give her guests a ride to the nearest town, where they’d later book a private carriage for them to return home. Mister Harrington, as an unsocial bachelor as he always was, was waiting in the carriage for Madame Sylvia to say her parting words to Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>“You have a very bright future, Young Lady Bhela. A girl with limitless potential. So your favor will become very valuable as you mature,” Madame Sylvia said. “If you need something, you can always send letters to my sect. Don’t hold back. Just think about this of us making an investment.”</p>\n<p>Since Bhela a smart girl anyway, Madame Sylvia decided not to make her words fancy and told her in a straightforward manner. Bhela appreciated her honesty, and said her thanks.</p>\n<p>The carriage then set off. In the main gate of Badril Village, the guards on duty witnessed the recently blazing popular Young Lady Bhela Malikh bowing her body as she sent off two foreigners in traveling clothes made from expensive linen.</p>\n<p>“Look at how she is,” inside the carriage, Madame Sylvia said to Mister Harrington. “She’s a pretty sensible girl, don’t you think?”</p>\n<p>“She is,” Mister Harrington said softly, almost a murmur.</p>\n<p>It was hard to start a conversation whenever Mister Harrington sat with his arms crossed tightly. Madame Sylvia could see that he wasn’t exactly happy with the outcome regarding Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>There was no bandits lurking around, and no monsters occasionally came out, proved that the lands around Badril Village actually well-protected--too well, perhaps, for a rural village without a major power backing them. Their journey was smooth without disturbance. Thirty minutes after they left Badril Village, they encountered another carriage painted with black-jet color. The black carriage was well-decorated with golden-colored plates, obviously elites or nobles were traveling inside.</p>\n<p>However, unlike common nobles who liked to hide in the carriage to show-off their elegance and aloofness, this carriage simply out of commonsense. To talk about how weird this carriage was there was a need to point out the refreshing greenness of the view around. Despite there being a road far away from settlement, hint of liveliness from bird chirping--along with croaking frogs from nearby streams and singing insects--completed the idyllic road with a strange harmony that invited light-hearted person to sing along with lively nature. That was exactly what the noble in the black carriage doing. A young lady with a very girly and childish feature was carefreely sitting in the window in spite of pale servants begging her to sit still. She completely dumb about the servants’ pleas. And with her personality, nobody knew whether she was pretending or not. The only thing that the jubilant Lyla Blackwood cared about was singing an off-tune song about her befriending village frogs and bunnies.</p>\n<p>“Prepare your life you frogs and bunnies~</p>\n<p>Cause I’m not letting you go before we become the best of buddies~~</p>\n<p>Wait for me you birdies and kitties~~</p>\n<p>Cause we’re about to become the best of all buddies~~ yuhuu~ yuhuu~~</p>\n<p>The best buddies in this lifetime~~ yuhuuuu~~~”</p>\n<p>There was nothing the servants and the guards could do to stop their young lady from singing this amazingly ugly song about her future exploits in Badril Village. Seeing that another carriage approaching, the horse-riding guards did their best to block the view to the crest planted on the carriage’s compartment. Their effort to save faces from the young lady’s mishap was futile, however, since the other party happened to know Lyla.</p>\n<p>“How many times have I told you to stay away from windows, Lyla!”</p>\n<p>“Whu--what? Who?” Lyla was surprised. But then she was elated to see a familiar face. “Is that you, Instructor Sylvia? You here to train Sis Bhela’s archery again?”</p>\n<p>“Get down from the window!” Madame Sylvia raised her voice.</p>\n<p>“I’m also here to meet Sis Bhela!” Lyla also raised her voice cheerfully.</p>\n<p>“Lyla, you won’t be able to get married in the future if you’re always act like this!” Madame Sylvia warned her. She long dropped title of Young Lady Blackwood when talking to this naughty girl.</p>\n<p>“Um!” Lyla nodded. “But which one do you like more, Instructor Sylvia, bunnies or kitties?” It was no use trying to talk sense to Lyla. Any warning only come to her right ear and gone out straight from the left one.</p>\n<p>“Stay away from the windows!!!” Madame Sylvia screamed until her voice shrilled.</p>\n<p>Lyla also screamed, “Good morning to you too!!!”</p>\n<p>Both carriages drifted apart after the brief encounter. It ended with Lyla happily waved her hands happily. Madame Sylvia sighed and shook her head. That girl was so naughty that the troubles she created made the seminars’ managements even considered to drop her once during the seminars. Only after Bhela Malikh convinced them she’d take care of Lyla they finally did let go the matter.</p>\n<p>Before, the black carriage of Blackwood Family came to Badril Village in the shroud of night’s darkness, so nobody noticed their elegance and the aura of expensive carriage blazing through the village road--of which was surprisingly wide for a settlement road, unlike road of cities in the western kingdoms, because long ago Mossack people needed to endure monster stampedes passing through their villages once every few months.</p>\n<p>“Mom, look, is that a noble?” a snotty kid pointing out the carriage.</p>\n<p>The mother hurriedly pulled her child. “Ssuuussh! Keep your finger to yourself! Don’t you know what happened to peasants that make noble angry from the stories they always talking about?”</p>\n<p>The steel-armored guards who escort the carriage scoffed them in disdain. Contrast with the escorts’ attitudes, Lyla waved her hand at them, while shouting, “Hey boy, don’t you think bunnies are cute as the kitties? Or do you like cats more?”</p>\n<p>The kid didn’t answer. He instead forced to bow by her mother and let the carriage went through silently. The villagers didn’t have the experience in receiving nobles, most of them--except for those who attended the ngajen ceremony in Malikh Family--had never saw nobles in their lives. Because of that they were awkward and didn’t know what to do.</p>\n<p>Lyla didn’t seem to mind their stiffness. Instead, she vigorously greeted everyone she saw from the window she sat on.</p>\n<p>“Good day! Good morning! I’m here to sleepover at Sis Bhela’s place! Do you know where Sis Bhela lives?”</p>\n<p>Back in Elzhier Family, in the main family’s house, their patriarch, hurriedly changed his clothes to a formal one he always used every ngajen ceremony.</p>\n<p>“Hurry, hurry! As the head of this village, how can I let a noble arriving without me receiving them?!”</p>\n<p>Not even he yet buttoned his shirt properly, the Village Head sprinted toward the main street, only to see the crowd of onlookers already dispersed and still talking about the scary nobles they always heard in stories were actually <em>weirdly</em> friendly.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Bhela Malikh was already notified about Lyla Blackwood’s arrival. She waited on a chair at the Malikh Family’s gate, drinking a fresh young coconut water occasionally. The black carriage finally was in her view. And the young girl she was waiting for happily waved her hand at her. From the window.</p>\n<p>“Carefull, Lyla!” Bhela yelled as she sprang from her chair.</p>\n<p>“Huuupp!” Lyla Blackwood simply didn’t want to waste anytime leaving the carriage through the door. So she simply jumped from the window she sat upon, before the carriage even stopped. It was fortunate that amongst Bhela’s skill as a Unique Class, she had <b>Haste</b>, which boosted her speed in short duration. She used that to catch Lyla before she hurt herself. The young noble girl landed splendidly in Bhela’s arm.</p>\n<p>“What’s this, Sistah?” Lyla’s eyes sparkled when she saw Bhela get a young coconut in her other hand. She was completely oblivious she just did something dangerous.</p>\n<p>“Young coconut. There’s still some of its water left. Here, try this,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“For me? Really?”</p>\n<p>“Drink slowly…”</p>\n<p><em>Glug glug glug</em>. Lyla drank the coconut in anything but in slowly manner. She even burped shamelessly.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Lyla, ah!” the butler who coming with her was in horror seeing how Young Lady Lyla Blackwood made a horrible mess by spilling the coconut water on her expensive, silk woven black dress. Only an equally expensive silk handkerchief worthy enough to wipe his young lady’s noble dress!</p>\n<p>“I told you to drink slowly…” Bhela said. She used her sleeve to wipe Lyla’s wet face, and then proceeded to also wipe Lyla’s dress.</p>\n<p>“Y-young miss!” the butler shouted in panic. His body jolted as soon as he saw the outrageous act of spoiling the young noble’s dress by making it contacted with commoner clothes. That was heresy! He needed her to stop before she contained Blackwood’s expensive dress with her commoner’s bacteria!</p>\n<p>“You need something?” Bhela looked at this unfamiliar butler of Blackwood Family. Her expressionless face judged the butler coldly.</p>\n<p>“My name is Tim, young miss--please use this!” the butler offered a silky smooth handkerchief with Blackwood Family’s crest embroidered on the surface. The handkerchief was actually the butler’s, was awarded to his great-great-great grandfather by the then Baron Blackwood for some sort of achievement that practically nobody was still alive to remember. Everytime Butler Tim met a new person, he’d make an excuse to show off this particular handkerchief. Today was no exception. It was his most precious handkerchief. Just from the look of it one could tell how crazy expensive it was.</p>\n<p>“Ah, ah… my nose… aahhh--” Lyla felt her nose was wet and itchy, “--ahhtchii!!!”</p>\n<p>“You’ve got a flu?” Bhela asked worriedly.</p>\n<p>“Yeah. Aunt Jiji told me to drink my medicine everyday but it’s so bitter. So much bitter that it’s evil!”</p>\n<p>“Where’s your medicine now?”</p>\n<p>“Oh. I throw it away last night.”</p>\n<p>Bhela shook her head.</p>\n<p>“That’s no good. You can’t throw away your medicine like that. Now, wipe your nose. This mister butler said to use this…” she put the handkerchief on Lyla’s nose, and Lyla blew her nose on it.</p>\n<p>Lyla gave back the handkerchief to Butler Tim. “Thank you, Sir Butler. It’s very helpful of you.”</p>\n<p>The butler received back his most precious handkerchief. Bonus Lyla’s snot.</p>\n<p>“Come on inside,” Bhela said to Lyla. “Even if the water runs dry, coconuts still have meat we can scoop. After that we’ll pick some star fruits that I planted since I was a child.”</p>\n<p>“Star fruits! Woohooo!”</p>\n<p>The girls then walked inside. Lyla was so excited she didn’t leave her friend, hanging on her neck like a koala being comfortable on a tree branch. The stories about a noble young lady coming to Malikh Family for Bhela Malikh spread amongst the maidservants like oil being poured on an open wildfire. The Malikhs couldn’t describe the pride seeing their eldest young lady with a blue blood friend. Especially the aunties. They watched how close Bhela and Lyla with teary eyes and happy smiles.</p>\n<p>“Young lady is… finally… finally…”</p>\n<p>“She finally has a friend…”</p>\n<p>“Huuu… huuu… merciful Goddesses finally saw the young lady’s plight and blessed her with a real friend… huuu huuuu….”</p>\n<p>Nobody more happier than the aunties who were familiar with how their Young Lady Bhela lived her live. They silently cried watching their young lady, who usually alone and unapproachable, finally grown up and had her first friend in these past ten years.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Butler Tim grimaced inside. Despite the fact that he was tasked to win over Bhela Malikh with any means necessary, he didn’t like this girl. It wasn’t because his handkerchief got dirty--well, maybe he resented her for it a little--it because the girl named Bhela Malikh wasn’t acting as a young country girl supposed to act. Country bumpkins supposed to falter when they saw the radiance seeped out of the nobles’ aura, they supposed to tremble when they saw the noble wealth glittering beneath the sun. But this girl was indifferent and aloof. She was cold but the coldness paired with concise and elegant mannerism. Butler Tim knew she trying to act noble herself. That was why he didn’t like her.</p>\n<p>However, Butler Tim was a smart person. Any smart person would wear a perfect smile despite his heart bleeding over the snot on his precious handkerchief. Before leaving the city, the butler didn’t forget to look for a gift he’d use to lower the Malikh Family’s guard. He heard the previous gift was rejected, and when he asked for the content of the gift, the smart Butler Tim shook his head as if he knew it would happen.</p>\n<p>Toward country bumpkins, too expensive gifts would never work. He knew this because he was smart. And because he was smart, he knew better gifts. Not-so-expensive gifts worked for country bumpkins.</p>\n<p>Therefore, he presented Bhela Malikh with popular city biscuits.</p>\n<p>“I heard this biscuit is currently very popular among noble young ladies. This butler happened to pass by a store that sold this, so I reckon Young Lady Bhela might love to taste some.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, because the elders roughly knew the Blackwood Family’s youngest lady would come to visit, two leaders of opposing factions came to watch how their Young Lady Bhela would receive the noble guest. Elder Jhamil was all smiling because he liked what he saw. But the expression of Elder Khasim turned sour when he saw how the butler of Blackwood Family tried to butter up to Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>“Don’t accept it, young lady, please….” Elder Khasim whispered under his breath. Of course, there was no single soul heard what he just said. He was worried the hard work to rebuild his faction’s morale all would turn into dust if people thought their spiritual mascot, the one and only Young Lady Bhela Malikh, could be bought with mere biscuits.</p>\n<p>Contrary to what Elder Khasim hoped, Bhela Malikh received the gift without even putting a second thought. A feeling of defeat surged inside him. Elder Jhamil looked at his rival with a mocking glance.</p>\n<p>After receiving the snacks, Bhela excused herself and brought Lyla with her to stroll around Malikh Family’s gardens. Butler Tim pretended to wave his hand and smiled, but inside, he was gloating at how hypocrite Bhela was. His guess that Young Lady Bhela wouldn’t refuse the gift he brought was entirely correct. Before, he deliberately said the biscuit was noble young ladies’ favorite. Thus, according to his smart logic, as long as it wasn’t too expensive that it’d scare this fake young lady, no way a noble wannabe would reject this kind of gifts.</p>\n<p>“Heh,” Butler Tim scoffed when Bhela and Lyla already left. “Bet you’ve never eaten any city biscuits your entire life, haven’t you.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, Bhela Malikh hadn’t had any city biscuits her entire life. Not before and also not today. What Butler Tim didn’t know was that the snacks he bought with his own money ultimately ended up returned to Blackwood Family--to be exact, it ended up inside Lyla Blackwood’s belly. Bhela couldn’t help but received the biscuits when, beside her, she saw Lyla was drooling looking at the biscuits.</p>\n<p>The elders led by Elder Jhamil then respectfully welcomed the butler along with servants and guards from Blackwood Family. From the impression alone, Butler Tim could see reasons for him to like this slick-tongued Elder Jhamil. He knew how to flatter and also he knew how to act humble in front of people with higher status than him. Not like that noble-wannabe Young Lady of Malikh Family. This Elder Jhamil knew that he was only a country bumpkin thus acted accordingly. Naturally, the smart Butler Tim was pleased.</p>\n<p>And so began Butler Tim’s quests to swallow Malikh Family with his smartly planned schemes and cunning political games.</p>\n<p>In mere hours, the neutral elders who hadn’t joined either both rivalling factions began flocking to Elder Jhamil’s side. One part because they wanted to side with the faction that had the noble support and another part simply because Elder Jhamil, with the help of Butler Tim, had been throwing around sweet deals over all directions.</p>\n<p>“Only one tenth of the elder council members don’t want to pick a side by now, but their number is too significant to be an obstacle for Sir Butler’s great plan,” Elder Jhamil reported the current situation to Butler Tim.</p>\n<p>The butler was enjoying a glass of tea served by the maid that supposed to serve Young Lady Lyla Blackwood as if he was the visiting noble himself. He nodded. “I see. With this, the first stage of my plan has been completed.”</p>\n<p>“Oohhh!” Elder Jhamil exclaimed. “Sir Butler summoned rain and fire by flipping Malikh Family’s political scene upside down, and this is only the first stage?! As expected, the Butler of Blackwood Family is very smart!”</p>\n<p>Butler Tim originally wanted to act aloof and sophisticated before he visited this rural village. However, upon being called a smart person, he couldn’t help but grinned widely. “Oho, you’re an interesting fella, aren’t you? Very well, since you’ve done a good job yourself, I won’t be so petty to grab all the credit. Tell me how I should do next, if I like what I hear, we might as well corporate your thoughts into my plan.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was excited. How could he not? An opportunity to rise beyond a mere elder of rural village was laid before him.</p>\n<p>“Sir Butler, you may not know this, but we Mossack people regard having a good meal very highly. Everytime we’re having breakfast or dinner together as the entire family, even though we’re always looked peaceful outside, those trivial events actually are a political battlefield for us elders to extend our influence! This lowly man himself used a few move in the past during breakfast to gather like-minded men under my banner. I used all my resources and connections in a single mealtime to attack my rivals! However, these past two days, my biggest rival used a lowly method against me…”</p>\n<p>“Oh? What did he do?” Butler Tim asked.</p>\n<p>“He didn’t do much,” Elder Jhamil said, sneering when he was talking about this rival of his, “all he did was inviting Young Lady Bhela everytime we were having a meal in the family hall. He’s been a stubborn and ignorant supporter of main family, but this time he actually knew how to use his connection with the main family to deal a blow against me. A few of the elders had been faltering when they saw Young Lady Bhela leaning over the other side; I’m afraid if we’re leaving this ignorant rival of me doing as he wanted, there’s gonna be a hole in Sir Butler’s smart plan!”</p>\n<p>Butler Tim swirled the tea in his cup as though he was deep in thought. Of course, if this proven to endanger his smart plan, the butler couldn’t sit still watching all that happened. “I heard the Mossacks are peculiar people, but I don’t know you Mossack people have a strange custom!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, we’re living here far away from the city, so of course our traditions might seem unsophisticated to wise westerners like Sir Butler,” Elder Jhamil fawned.</p>\n<p>“Then what do you suggest Blackwood Family should do in this situation, Elder Jhamil?”</p>\n<p>“It’s easy!” Elder Jhamil was so excited he almost jumped from his seat. “My rival faction used Young Lady Bhela to gain foothold, and we can also use that to deal a greater blow back to them!”</p>\n<p>“And that is?”</p>\n<p>“Of course, we can use--I mean, we can invite young noble miss to a dinner together with us. With this we can unofficially announce our alliance with Blackwood Family! It’s the final nail to main family’s faction!”</p>\n<p>Even though Bhela Malikh’s status as a Unique Class shone throughout all of Badril Village, her name still fall short with a pure noble like Lyla Blackwood. Madam back in Blackwood Family used her daughter so Blackwood could infiltrate Malikh Family easily, but that didn’t mean Lyla still wasn’t as useful.</p>\n<p>“Very well. Let us go with that,” then he asked the maid responsible for Lyla’s schedule. “What was Young Lady Lyla doing this afternoon?”</p>\n<p>The maid replied, “Young Lady Bhela Malikh carried her around to play. At first, they went to Malikh Family’s orchard to pick some fruits. Then they visited the sick Patriarch Malikh in his room for a few minutes. After that, they went outside to stroll and came back with a new rabbit pet they bought from other family. Finally, when the sun is setting, they went to the kitchen to watch the servants cooking.”</p>\n<p>“How uncouth for a noble young lady being led around in dirty places like that,” Butler Tim was displeased, but nothing he could do since making Bhela’s attention elsewhere meant he could move freely to make a trap for her. Nodding to himself, the butler then gave an instruction to the maid, “you go to Young Lady Lyla and tell that Malikh Family invite her for a dinner.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was excitedly rubbing his hands when Butler Tim said that. Finally, payback to those imbecile Elder Khasim!</p>\n<p>“But, Butler Tim…” the maid hesitated.</p>\n<p>“What is it?”</p>\n<p>“Malikh Family already invited Young Lady Lyla to have dinner. She’s eating in Malikh Family’s hall right now….”</p>\n<p>“Hmm, what do you mean?”</p>\n<p>What the maid meant was that someone in Malikh Family already brought Lyla to have dinner with them.</p>\n<p>When Butler Tim playing political games and scheming around in Malikh Family, Bhela Malikh, along with the elders friendly with Elder Khasim, had been giving bunch of candies and food for Lyla Blackwood, much more than the biscuits Butler Tim brought with him. Being a great foodie herself, Lyla never had enough, the first day in Malikh Family she ate more sweets and foods worth of one week back in Blackwood Family’s manor. Aunt Jiji and other Blackwood Family’s maid servants would freak out if they saw how glutton Lyla currently was.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the news that the main family’s faction hosting a dinner for a noble miss swept Malikh Family like a thunderstorm. The neutral elders Elder Jhamil had just bought flocking back toward Elder Khasim’s side. It was so sudden. Everyone wasn’t even got a breath to process what had happened. And this for sure was an unprecedented move ever since Patriarch Ghalim suddenly fell ill and retreated from the political scene.</p>\n<p>Just as one side was busy completing the first stage to win over the Young Lady of Malikh Family, the other side already won over Young Lady of the noble Blackwood Family. All happened in a span of a single day.</p>\n<p>“Y-young Lady Lyla…”</p>\n<p>Even Butler Tim couldn’t pull his own young miss seeing how happy she was. His plan had been jabbed in a completely unexpected way. Maybe he wasn’t so smart after all.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>It was unfortunate that Madam Malikh didn’t see the Young Noble Miss of Blackwood Family kindly. Even though the girl did nothing wrong, Madam Malikh wasn’t so muddled that she wasn’t aware what Blackwood Family and those corrupt elders conspiring against her husband and Malikh’s main family. Even Bhela herself couldn’t do anything to change her mother’s mind.</p>\n<p>However, Lyla Blackwood, an airhead as she always was, was oblivious of the hostility directed toward her.</p>\n<p>It was morning the second day Lyla in Badril Village. Following her friend Bhela, she carried a little box inside Patriarch Ghalim’s bedroom. This little box filled with custom-made medicines--most were amateurly mixed from two different trivial medicines, consisted of remedies for flu and headache. Nothing harmful but nothing useful at the same time. And just like yesterday, to pay for Bhela parents’ kindness for letting her staying in Malikh Family, Lyla Blackwood decided to play doctor a little bit.</p>\n<p>“Uncle, I’m coming again to help you feel better,” Lyla said as she dragged a chair and sat beside Patriarch Ghalim’s sick bed. Seeing the pale middle-aged man in bed, she blinked her googly eyes, then continued, “how’s yesterday medicine I gave you. Are you feeling a tiny minny bit better, perhaps?”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim certainly was feeling better these past few days, not because Lyla’s medicines, but Grandpa Piss’s diagnosis and remedies. Toward this girl, he weakly nodded. “Thank you for your help, little lady.”</p>\n<p>“Then I’m going to fed you my newest recipe, uncle. Here, here, open your mouth.”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghamil did what he was told. Because Lyla didn’t like bitter medicine, she added lots of brown sugar. Lots and lots of brown sugar.</p>\n<p>“It’s… sweet.”</p>\n<p>“Are you feeling better, now?” Lyla asked.</p>\n<p>“Yes, little lady, I’m feeling better.”</p>\n<p>As a matter of fact, he wasn’t. The medicine was more like a candy than remedy.</p>\n<p>“Good! If you eat this three times a day, maybe your illness would go away, uncle,” Lyla then sternly pointed out, “maybe!”</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh was nervous when her husband consumed the strange medicine Lyla gave him, but she didn’t open her mouth to protest. Bhela was changing the pillows’ sheet nearby, and doing some other chores that usually were done by the servants. In the meantime, Lyla was giving advice for Patriarch Ghalim liked how he should eat moderately three times a day, how he should brush his teeth after he ate sweets, and all the things Aunt Jiji told Lyla all the time.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to visit again, uncle, get well soon!” Lyla waved her hands. Carrying a broom in her hands, Lyla’s next schedule was following Bhela doing chores in the courtyard.</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim weakly waved his hand back. Of course, after the girls were already gone, he noticed his bitter wife biting her lips indignantly.</p>\n<p>“Don’t stare the girl so much. She’s not responsible for her family’s wrongdoings. It’s not like a girl her age knows what her parents do behind the scene.”</p>\n<p>“Why did you eat that? What if they used her to give you more poison?”</p>\n<p>“Bhela wouldn’t let me have the medicine if she didn’t what it was, no? Stop putting that kind of face, you only make our daughter feels awkward about all this.”</p>\n<p>The woman held her husband’s hand, kissing it with her forehead as she hid her face. She whispered, “Oh, don’t you know how hurt this heart holding back my grievance? Why did our daughter had to bring someone from that family inside our roof?” she sniffed, “how long this farce gonna last? What should I do in the mean time? Oh! I don’t know! I don’t know!”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim sighed as he witnessed his wife cried helplessly.</p>\n<p>In the courtyard, near the coops where Malikh Family raised chickens and ducks, Lyla was squatting in front of the new bunny she and Bhela bought just yesterday. She was waiting the whole morning just to feed this bunny. The bunny hopped around, itching to play in spite it couldn’t resist the temptation of delicious green leaves, again and again. Wathing how glutton the bunny was, Lyla found herself immerse in immense joy. She very much envying the life of a bunny. Perhaps that because she could relate to how it spent its day without worry; eating, playing, sleeping, then playing again--a life that she longed to have. If only she was born a rabbit instead of a young lady of noble family….</p>\n<p>The sound of the broom swept the ground took away her attention. Lyla couldn’t understand how a daughter of a patriarch like Bhela had to work so much.</p>\n<p>“Why do you work so much, Sistah?” Lyla asked when she found out there still much dry leaves Bhela had to sweep. “Won’t you get bored soon? Just let the servants clean this place.”</p>\n<p>Bhela, sweeping as if Lyla’s idleness didn’t bother her the slightest, replied, “Here in Badril Village, everyone who hasn’t done their coming of age ceremony has to do chores for their parents. It doesn’t matter if it’s the farmer’s daughter or the biggest family’s young lady, helping the matter of the household is one of the seven virtues we Mossack people get to do for our parents.”</p>\n<p>Originally, Lyla wanted her friend also playing with the bunny. But hearing Bhela just said something serious, there was no way she’d reveal her intention now. “My mom always nagging me to go to dance lesson or whatever. It’s very very boring,” she murmured, a bit dejected.</p>\n<p>“The west and the south have different values,” Bhela said. “Complete your virtue for your parents then you’ll grow to be a fine lady, Lyla.”</p>\n<p>“Uggghhh…” Lyla grunted as she didn’t want to continue the topic any further. She long developed a sense for her own survival to detect whether or not the conversation ended up she being forced to do some boring stuff. Knowing Bhela’s personality, Lyla knew soon Sis Bhela’d make her doing chores too. Grabbing the bunny, Lyla quickly escaped somewhere else so that she could spend her time playing. Bhela shook her head seeing the girl’s behavior.</p>\n<p>Bhela then noticed some servants whispering while they looking at Lyla from the distance. Many people were curious what a noble young lady like her would do in a rural place like this, and Bhela wasn’t that oblivious not to notice the eyes planted by the elders of Malikh Family.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, she then saw four girls dressed in expensive garments approaching Lyla with their mouth covered with feathered fans in their hands. Their clothing looked as if they attending some sort of ceremony, while in fact, they calculated that this kind of appearance was the most suitable for them to socialize with a girl of blue-blooded origin. Bhela recognized the leader of those girls was actually Elder Jhamil’s niece.</p>\n<p>“Have you read Le Armour dan Varoza written by Leornador De Gonzalez, Young Lady Blackwood?”</p>\n<p>“Ah, yes, that piece was adequately sophisticated but I think Vista van Gracious’s omnibus more than adequate, le banjour?”</p>\n<p>“I see, I see, their pieces adequately well-written as those senor themselves adequattely live as maestro. But perhaps equoliette more than fit the diagram as paradigm sensorita abligioate senor des adequately le banjour.”</p>\n<p>“But of course, Young Lady Blackwood is more addequately sophisitacted as it’s a noblesse obligiote to be more sohpisitacated than us village senioritas. Perhaps le banjour is fortuna with de gracious by Young Lady’s great wisdom?”</p>\n<p>Lyla blinked her eyes trying to decipher whatever these girls mean. The bunny in her arms even escaped amidst her confusion.</p>\n<p>“Uhh… uhhh…” Lyla timidly stepped back from the feathered fan girls. “I think Sis Bhela is calling me…”</p>\n<p>She swiftly ran away back to her friend Bhela.</p>\n<p>“Sistah, Sistah Bhela!” Lyla cried and grabbing Bhela’s sloven sleeve tightly, demanding for justice, “they came to bully me!”</p>\n<p>“What did they do?” Bhela asked.</p>\n<p>“They know I can’t speak western language! They came to test me! They’re even worse than those rich girls in seminar--they jumble some western mumbo jumbo into plain language in order to confuse me! They must be laughing and call me stupid by now!”</p>\n<p>Hearing Lyla’s grievance, Bhela patted her head in order to let the girl calmed down.</p>\n<p>“Lyla, those girls are different than the noble girls that always making fun of you.”</p>\n<p>“Different? How so?”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at the girls who also was watching them back while fanning themselves with their fabulous feathered fans.</p>\n<p>“They looked like noble descendants, but actually were not.”</p>\n<p>“I still don’t like them nonetheless!”</p>\n<p>“You don’t have to talk to them if you don’t want to,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>Yet Lyla still restlessly tugging Bhela’s sleeves, making it harder for her to do her chores. Before the peers that always making fun of her, Lyla was always helpless and had been depending on Bhela’s figure as a shield. What it looked like from the point of view of an outsider was a scene where a young mother being tested of her patience dealing with a girl who was throwing a tantrum.</p>\n<p>Seeing that the young noble miss wouldn’t come back soon, the feathered fan girls approaching Bhela and Lyla instead.</p>\n<p>“Oh, fancy to meet Young Lady Bhela here, le banjour!”</p>\n<p>“Le bonjour…” Bhela hesitated to reply back. Tilting her head slightly, she studied the pompously dressed girls before her. These girls were relatives of Malikh Family’s elders. None of them could match with Bhela if talking strictly about social status wise, not to mention talents. However, while she was holding her broom, it looked like Bhela was the one with common origin, while these girls were floating swans who happened to be generous enough to greet plebeians with their <em>unique</em> vocabulary.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Lyla Blackwood hid behind Lyla’s back. Despite a noble origin herself, meeting more cocky and fake young ladies than the girls before her were rare experience for Lyla.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela, fancy to meet you. Good morning. The weather is nice. I eat snails everyday,” Elder Jhamil’s niece took the lead and said that with a hint of inflated pride.</p>\n<p>Bhela narrowed her eyes. She could see why Lyla instantly hated these girls. She then said in a sleek foreign language, “Je ne sais pas de quoi tu parles. Si vous ne parlez pas une langue étrangère, fermez simplement la bouche, sinon vous faites peur aux enfants avec votre non-sens.”</p>\n<p>The feathered fan girls blinked their eyes trying to decipher whatever Bhela had said.</p>\n<p>“Oh, it turns out Young Lady Bhela is aquadettely know some le banjour!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, Young Lady Bhela is adequately sophisticated after all. Me gusta!”</p>\n<p>“I see, I see, le pasta fortuna is delicosaza.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s niece didn’t say anything as she only maintained a sweet smile while being nervous herself. Racking her brains over remembering the contents of thick dictionary, she tried to form a decent sentences in foreign language. But Bhela then cut off her train of thought before she could say a word.</p>\n<p>“Blackwood Family is migrating noble that has long been making their roots here in southern land. Hundred of years living far away from their western peers, noble families like this would naturally become more lax. It’s natural for Lyla to not mastering her homeland’s native tongue.”</p>\n<p>Bhela said that in a straight manner. That was a white lie, however. It was true that many noble families coming from the western side of Tiramikal Continent to forgot their western root and began to see themselves as southerners. But those were usually the case depending right circumstances, like exiled nobles, or some young masters who had lost in political battle branched out and fancied themselves a legit noble family with themselves at the helm. Blackwood Family weren’t exiled nobles, and though Lyla’s ancestors branching out some hundreds of years ago, that didn’t automatically made them cutting off ties with the original family. The main family of Blackwood was back in a western country called Tatalghia Kingdom, still sending letters and envoys from time to time to the branch Lyla was living in--although, undeniably, the southern branch of Blackwood Family had long developed and surpassed the main one.</p>\n<p>It seemed like Bhela already used to tell this lie. Anyone who heard this would be forced to accept it, unless they wanted to spend time and resources digging through the details--which to be honest, none of these pompous young girls were willing or simply unable to go through.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Elder Jhamil’s niece believed Lyla’s family exempt her to excel in foreign language. Yet she was still displeased inside. Her uncle told her that Bhela had been hogging the young noble’s influence for herself, everyone in Malikh Family already knew how Bhela Malikh carrying around the noble young lady yesterday. So what if she had some more bit of talent and had been running around overseas in that whatever seminars she was attending? A bumpkin origin wouldn’t be able to change their bumpkin bloodline. So if Bhela had the right to get close with the Young Lady of Blackwood Family, that meant someone coming from the same family should have the same change as her!</p>\n<p>The elder’s niece said, “Young Lady Bhela, I know the main family is prideful. But Young Lady Blackwood is here to experience the village slow life. Don’t you think she also needs to mingle with us commoners?”</p>\n<p>“Lyla will befriend any person she fancies herself, I don’t control with whom she wants to socialize with,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“If that’s the case, then why she still has no friends other than you?”</p>\n<p>“That’s not true!” Lyla cried indignantly, “I’ve made friends! With aunties! Aunties in the kitchen!”</p>\n<p>It was easy to be friendly with Lyla. She was always unconventional and never saw people by the social system. To her, people only divided by two types, those who gave her food and those who didn’t. She was like a cat. Just bring a good food and she’d be very friendly the next moment.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Lyla’s frank open-mindedness wasn’t easily accepted by some people. Elder Jhamil’s niece gasped as she looked at Lyla and Bhela, back and forth. “My goodness! Young Lady Bhela, were you letting a noble young lady such as Young Lady Blackwood mingle with dirty servants?!”</p>\n<p>“Why wouldn’t I?” Bhela asked back.</p>\n<p>“You--don’t young lady care about our family’s reputation? What if people said we’ve mistreated a noble young lady?”</p>\n<p>“Lyla is here to experience village slow life,” Bhela said slowly, “don’t you think she also needs to mingle with commoners?”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s niece was speechless as Bhela used her own words. The contorted expression on her chaky make-up face brought satisfaction for Lyla, who then snorted.</p>\n<p>“What now? Kitty got your tongue?” Lyla said with her mouth pouted. “So that you know, Sis Bhela already made speechless many many bullies like you! Who were many many many times smarter than you! This is what you get by making fun of me--shame on you, hmph! Who’s the stupid one, now?”</p>\n<p>Even after losing a round of squabble against Young Lady Bhela, unexpectedly the nobly young lady herself became hostile against her. All was so sudden that it made blood drained from her face.</p>\n<p>Bhela ruffled Lyla’s hair. Apparently Lyla still believed these girls came to bully her. When Lyla already made up her mind to not liking someone, it was hard to bend on her opinion.</p>\n<p>“Let’s go, Lyla. We’ll help aunties make sweets for afternoon lunch,” Bhela said. Back in the seminars, when Bhela asked Lyla to do some chores, the supposed noble young lady of Blackwood Family would move slowly, occasionally pouting and murmuring some complaints, unwilling to exert her calories on some boring stuff. However, it was different if the destination was kitchen. The spirit of lively bunny would come to possess her--she’d jolt, sprinting, unwilling to waste time as the promise of free sweets and delicious salty snacks was revealed before her.</p>\n<p>“What was that about?!” one of the le bonjour girls scowled after Bhela and Lyla was gone. “How could a young lady speaks like that?”</p>\n<p>“Bhela must lead her around to act like that! Did you hear what she said? The noble young lady thinks we bully her or something.”</p>\n<p>“Aahhh! What a manipulative bitch! I really want to know what that little cunt said to make Young Lady Blackwood think we had made fun of her. No way in hell someone would dare making fun of a noble like her!”</p>\n<p>Actually, Lyla was made fun of so many times. Especially during her study in the seminars abroad. She made fun of so much that she formed a survival instinct to hide behind Bhela’s back. But they didn’t know that. They just assumed as a young lady coming from a noble family, Lyla Blackwood would be adequately pure noble in stories and gossip. The main reason Bhela brought Lyla away was so that Lyla didn’t have to mingle with these delusional le bonjour girls.</p>\n<hr>\n","unregistered":[]},"novels/yashura-legacy/contents/volume-1/chapter-7.md":{"contributions":{},"lastModified":1589309280899,"data":{"title":"Venerable Mama Ross"},"body":"<p>In Badril Village, lived two friends who were as close as blood sisters. One had her posture clean, straight, noble--her spotless white face shone like gem, and she moved as graceful as a beautiful swan.</p>\n<p>The other one had a pair of curious, big googly eyes--coupled with her svelte neck yet plump cheeks, she looked like that one cute, hyperactive village girl if she was in plain clothes.</p>\n<p>The former one was prideful; she strived to be an excellent lady with her gifted talent. While the other girl, she had always been a playful one; the kind of girl that would slip away to play whenever left unchecked. The prideful Bhela never said it, but the playful Lyla knew that both of them were happy to be able to be together again after the seminars they attended together ended.</p>\n<p>During their idyllic time Badril Village, Bhela had heard the anxiety of her relatives and her allies regarding of Lyla’s presence. The minority were saying that Lyla, in spite of her status as a noble descent, was no more than a fodder, pretext for Butler Tim and the servants of Blackwood Family infiltrating Malikh Family. The unfortunate thing was that concern wasn't unfounded--indeed, Blackwood Family had been giving support to the opposing faction from the shadow, the tensions that previously shimmered in shadow began to surface. Some worried it was only a matter of time it burst into conflict. Yet, contrary to her aloof appearance, Bhela regarded ties of her friendship very seriously; everyone who had warned her out of good intention left shaking their heads helplessly after finding out the plan that Bhela had in mind. As Lyla was very excited and looking forward to explore the fun life that Badrill Village could offer, Bhela found herself weak and wasn’t willing to let Lyla down.</p>\n<p>After she was done with her chores, Bhela used the little spare time she had before archery training to write a single letter. This letter was to be sent to a long friend of hers, who she hadn’t met almost ten years.</p>\n<p>And naturally, as Elder Jhamil’s influence was powerful enough for him to monitor the letter coming in and out in Malikh Family, he was alerted by the letter Bhela Malikh had sent.</p>\n<p>“Oh, a letter? So she has more connections outside?” Butler Tim asked with one of his brows raised.</p>\n<p>“It’s actually the eldest Young Lady of Elzhier Family. Ten years ago, an expert was on a journey and accidentally found out that Elzhier Family had some talent suited for her sect. She was recruited back then, everyone was talking about it for months since she was the first one of Badril Village who was going to study overseas.”</p>\n<p>Maybe because his face showing a trace of concern, the maidservant who was waiting for Butler Tim quickly poured a cup of tea for him to ease his throat. Elder Jhamil, who was also sitting at the same table as Butler Tim, raised his empty cup toward the maidservant. He smiled as he wordlessly asked for his cup to be refilled. But the maidservant blatantly ignored him, acting as if this elder was empty air.</p>\n<p>“Is this something that I should be careful about, hmm?” sipping his tea, Butler Tim then asked Elder Jhamil.</p>\n<p>“N--no, from the way Elzhier Family behaved these past few years, I don’t think so.”</p>\n<p>Butler Tim also didn’t pursue the matter any further. Even if the girl really studied in a sect somewhere in rich western kingdom, really, what a country bumpkin could do in the city? Even those with talents, if they couldn’t keep up with the nobles whose resources were endless as the ocean, all country bumpkins could do was step aside to make way for the privileges.</p>\n<p>“You’re a capable man, Elder Jhamil. I’ll be waiting for a report about the letter’s reply in a few days time.”</p>\n<p>“Of course, Butler Tim, you can always rely on me!”</p>\n<p>Butler Tim nodded in satisfaction.</p>\n<p>“Good, then if nothing else, I’ll be going.”</p>\n<p>He stood up and began to walk out from the room. The tea serving maidservant followed him in a docile manner. When no one was around, Elder Jhamil who still in the room poured him a glass of tea, and picked the biscuit from the snack container. “Ahhh…” he sighed after he tasted how delicate the tea was after he poured milk in it. Indeed, even the life of a butler of a noble family was comfortable. Life as the most influential elder in Malikh Family couldn’t even compare.</p>\n<p>The letter Bhela sent, at least, would take several days depending how far the recipient was. Maybe even more than a week. So Elder Jhamil thought to himself that he should take it easy and enjoy life as Butler Tim demonstrated himself recently.</p>\n<p>Never would Elder Jhamil and Butler Tim thought that they were wrong. They merely thought the only opponent they had was a fifteen years old girl with talents.</p>\n<p>Thirty minutes after the courir was gone with the letter, a beautiful elder of Elzhier Family, along with a few maidservants, came to Malikh Family with food and snacks in their hands.</p>\n<p>“Oh, ohh! Elder Shyla, Malikh Family is honored to be graced by your presence!” Elder Jhamil immediately spouted his praise, despite his eyes couldn’t take off from the big things on the woman elder’s chest.</p>\n<p>“Oh, you and your tongue, Elder Jhamil!” the woman giggled charmingly. “I came here under my patriarch’s order. Yesterday, he regretted he had not preparing himself to receive dear noble as the Village Head of Badril Village. So Elzhier Family is here to send our token of apology to young noble miss, Lyla Blackwood!”</p>\n<p>Originally, Elder Jhamil was excited upon hearing Elder Shyla came visiting the family, excited both in mind and <em>lower</em> body. However, as soon as he heard she came for the noble, Elder Jhamil began to hesitate.</p>\n<p>“Oh, uhhh… Elder Shyla… you see, the noble is…”</p>\n<p>“Is Young Miss Lyla won’t receive our token of apology?” Elder Shyla’s tone was sad, almost a whimper. Then she began to talk about something unrelated, “recently shops under my management hadn’t been doing well. If this goes on, coupled with my failure to apologize to Young Miss, maybe Patriarch Elzhier will revoke my elder title…”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil blinked. It was famous in Badril Village that Elder Shyla had gained her status as an elder flawlessly by her own ability--yet someone like her, someone with great ability and <em>very big</em> assets, had her own problems she struggled with.</p>\n<p>“Haahh… I know I’m only living alone without a husband and has been… lonely,” she sighed melancholily--while not forgetting to swept her hair and “accidentally” flaunt her charm. “If only there’s someone who is reliable enough to lessen my worry…”</p>\n<p>Her charms really breathtaking. Elder Jhamil found himself gulping. Stammering, he then said, “E-elder Shyla, don’t be sad, I’m only considering that if the noble is resting or not. But, but… if you really need to apologize to dear noble… maybe I can ask whether the young noble lady is available!”</p>\n<p>Elder Shyla’s eyes brightened. She clapped once, then she exclaimed, “Really, Elder Jhamil, you can?”</p>\n<p>“Of course, of course, if the noble’s being troubled then it’s all on me!” Elder Jhamil thumped his chest proudly. “Please, Elder Shyla, please sit and drink this tea with milk and biscuits and wait as I’ll get you some good news. Please wait!”</p>\n<p>As if he was injected with chicken blood, Elder Jhamil bolted through the Malikh Family. He wasn’t looking to ask about the noble like he promised, but he came to his son instead.</p>\n<p>He asked his son, “Is your mother home?”</p>\n<p>His son then replied, “No, she’s outside gossiping again. I saw her with her gangs before, maybe she’ll back when the sun about to set like the usual.”</p>\n<p>“Great!” Elder Jhamil was so happy he almost jumped. “Maybe today I’ll get a chance of my lifetime!”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was excited, so excited that he failed to notice, in Elzhier Family, Patriarch Elzhier had never sent anyone to apologize to the noble. In fact, Patriarch Elzhier wasn’t even aware Elder Shyla was visiting Malikh Family.</p>\n<p>A maidservant of Elzhier Family walked on the corridor where it was usually off limit for the outsiders. When a Malikh Family elder noticed her, she said her objective, revealing the content of the tray she held--pastries, sweet wet snacks, and a few kinds of food as gifts. She intentionally mentioned that Elder Jhamil, who was chatting happily with Elder Shyla of Elzhier Family, already gave his consent. And just like that, this unassuming maid was able to reach the most unreachable part of Malikh Family: Bhela Malikh’s private archery field.</p>\n<p>Bhela was training her archery when the Elzhier Family’s maidservant came. Realizing there was a visitor, Bhela put down her brows and wiped her sweaty face with a towel.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela, we’ve received your letter. Eldest Young Lady sent me here,” the maidservant said.</p>\n<p>Bhela came to receive the tray from the maidservant. There were other two maidservants who were waiting for Bhela, they quickly prepared the table--which usually used to lay arrows and Bhela’s bows. Pretty soon, the table was full of delicious snacks.</p>\n<p>“This young miss, please sit down also,” Bhela asked the maidservant.</p>\n<p>With an ambiguous smile, the maidservant replied, “Young lady, I’m only a servant.”</p>\n<p>Bhela nodded as she understood. Although she said she was only a servant, Bhela knew she wasn’t anything like a servant in a rural village like she said. And the fact that she hadn’t had been bothered by the time it took for her to get a reply just a mere thirty minutes, it showed that Bhela had encountered people with similar temperament as this maidservant whenever she tried to contact the Eldest Young Lady of Elzhier Family during her time in the seminars.</p>\n<p>“We Mossack people consider rude to sit when our guest has to stand. So I’ll enjoy the treat while standing.”</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela, you flatter me…”</p>\n<p>“Do you mind if someone else join me on the table?” Bhela asked the Elzhier Family’s maidservant.</p>\n<p>“Please go ahead. Officially, these foods are going to be sent to Young Lady Lyla as a token of apology anyway.”</p>\n<p>Bhela was grateful. Even only glancing at the table someone like Bhela could notice some mixed foreign cuisines and biscuits on there, treats that were far more superior than the one Butler Tim gave her. And looking at them again, Bhela couldn’t help but felt familiar. She didn’t always remember what kind of food she ate, but she still could remember something that she ate on a regular basis.</p>\n<p>“Is this the same croissant they served in the seminars,” Bhela murmured after taking a bite.</p>\n<p>“Yes, Eldest Young Lady ordered the chef who made that croscant to live here in Badril Village. She said that you particularly enjoy croissant.”</p>\n<p>It was hard to think for a chef, who usually baked cakes and croissants for nobles and heirs of royal families, to be recruited casually into a rural village like this. Yet again, as Bhela had witnessed more outrages events regarding the friend she hadn’t met for about ten years, she was numb to it.</p>\n<p>“Lyla! Where are you? Come here a second!” Bhela then shouted.</p>\n<p>Not far away from there, from the thick foliage behind the archer field, came Lyla’s impatient cried, “Nuuu!!! I’m busy over here!”</p>\n<p>Bhela then said, “I’ve got croissants.”</p>\n<p>“CROOOOISSAAANNNTTTT!!!!”</p>\n<p>From the bushes leaped a silhouette of a girl. She bared her fangs, along with mouth leaking droll.</p>\n<p>“CROISSANT?! DID I HEAR A CROISSANT???? WHERE?!!!”</p>\n<p>Bhela waved the buttery pastry at her.</p>\n<p>“CROISSANT, I WANT!!!”</p>\n<p>Lyla sprinted as if there was no tomorrow. Her face completely filled with dirt, hair tangled with leaves, leaving her dress--which was supposed to represent her noble house--completely messy and dirty.</p>\n<p>“Which one is my share?” Lyla asked impatiently.</p>\n<p>“You can eat how many as you want,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>It was dangerous for an ignorant person to utter that sentence to Lyla, but as Bhela already veteran in feeding Lyla with snacks and food, she of course what would happen next: the pastry on the tray completely gone, stuffed inside Lyla’s mouth. Her cheeks got puffed like a nut addict squirrel.</p>\n<p><em>Om nom nom nom</em>.</p>\n<p>A rabbit hopped out of bushes. It looked around, then its eyes accidentally met with the swollen cheeks Lyla’s.</p>\n<p>“Mwister Bwaanyy!”</p>\n<p>The rabbit’s ears shot up in alert.</p>\n<p>“Whwere dwo ywu want to gwo, Mwister Bwanny? Don’t rwan awway from meehhh!”</p>\n<p>Not even she finished swallowing all the pastry she ate, Lyla already bolted again to chase the escaping rabbit. This was what happened if Lyla left unchecked, she just playing and, often times, suddenly rolling around on the ground for no apparent reason. Bhela knew Lyla couldn’t be this unrestrained back in Blackwood Family’s manor, so she let her be.</p>\n<p>“You two, please make sure Lyla doesn’t hurt herself,” Bhela said to the maids who were serving her.</p>\n<p>“Right away, young lady.”</p>\n<p>That left Bhela and the maidservant from Elzhier Family. Bhela knew there was going to be a discussion where no one else supposed to learn.</p>\n<p>The maidservant indeed brought a sensitive information with her. From her sleeve, the maidservant took out a scroll. “Young Lady Bhela, please take a look at this.”</p>\n<p>The scroll was lite. Enough to hide it easily between clothes. But the content was anything but light.</p>\n<p>“This is…”</p>\n<p>The first thing she read was a profile of someone named Tim Krosslugan. Born and raised in a servant family, fated to serve the Blackwood Family since childhood. The scroll contained his level of education, wealth, connections he made over the years, along with recent bribes he made or received and the name of his current lover. Bhela frowned when she recognized the name of the lover written in it.</p>\n<p>“Butler Tim… and that maid… are having an affair?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, the maidservant who always serving him a cup of tea. In fact, they’re doing it in a room right in this moment.”</p>\n<p>Bhela let out a soft groan. For them to neglect Lyla to this extent, even Bhela as the host was ashamed of their behaviour.</p>\n<p>“What would you do, young lady?” the Elzhier Family’s maidservant asked with her ambiguous voice, almost as if her tone was floating, “the intruders were disrespectful toward Malikh Family. If you read the scroll further, then you’ll see an applicable move you can make right here, right now.”</p>\n<p>Bhela read the next section, the tea serving maidservant’s name revealed. Although its content was lacking than Butler Tim’s, Bhela could see why the Elzhier Family’s maidservant recommended it. Turned out the tea serving maid’s lovers were not just Butler Tim, but some other people which one Bhela recognized--Frane Blackwood. That pompous Blackwood Family’s Young Master who always chasing her actually had a lover who was serving another man right inside his crush’s house.</p>\n<p>“This is disgusting,” Bhela murmured.</p>\n<p>“You can blackmail that butler. Although it’s quite usual for a noble young master to sleep with beautiful maids in his house, but that young master and the maid had their first time together a few years ago. So this maid’s position a little bit special.”</p>\n<p>Bhela frown tightened. It wasn’t that she didn’t care about a scandal happening right in her roof, but for a maiden like her to confront scandalous adults wouldn’t be a good sight to see. And the fact that Butler Tim had been distracted, from too much scheming and too much doing scandalous things with the maid, could turn out to benefit Lyla. This Blackwood girl was drunk by freedom, as these past few days, no one from the Blackwood Family seemed to try stopping her from playing till her legs cramped and eating till her belly bloated like a pregnant young woman. The Elzhier Family’s maidservant guessed roughly what Bhela had in mind, thus she didn’t mention about the affair again.</p>\n<p>“We also have complied the activities and unethical dealing of everyone under Elder Jhamil’s wings.”</p>\n<p>As Bhela read it further, she couldn’t help but be amazed by how detailed the report was. Some corruption cases even dated back ten years ago, when Bhela still only a brat who didn’t even yet to realize how evil Elder Jhamil whom she called uncle. It wasn’t that difficult to end Elder Jhamil’s career with only this. If she went down to that route, however, the major problem would be to political upheavals that would follow. Her father’s condition was a little better since the ngajen ceremony, to force him to stand up from his bed and lead the family, Bhela didn’t want to see that happen.</p>\n<p>“Have you make up your mind, young lady?”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” Bhela said, “a toothless tiger is as scary as an oversized domestic cat. I will use your sect’s gift to disarm my political enemy. Please send my thanks for Sister Ryntia Elzhier’s kindness again, this time.”</p>\n<p>In the end, she decided a softer measure, creating a balanced situation where Elder Jhamil’s faction weakened, but still not weak enough so that they still had their delusional ambition where they think they could swallow the entire Malikh Family by themselves.</p>\n<p>The Elzhier Family’s maidservant seemed to expect this kind of decision coming from Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>“Eldest Young Lady is your friend, Young Lady Bhela. It’s natural for us to take care of her friend,” the Elzhier Family’s maidservant said with her head slightly bowed. “But it is sadden us, Young Lady Bhela, to find out that you didn’t invite someone from our side on your little meeting during the ngajen ceremony.”</p>\n<p>“Ah…” this was why Bhela felt reluctant to ask for a favor again from them. She felt like an ungrateful one who bitten the hand that feeding her. She bowed her body deeply as she said, “I’m sorry for single you out. Sister Ryntia had already done so much for me, but the sect she’s in is too far away from my family--so in this situation, I’ll surely rely on you if I don’t have any more alternatives.”</p>\n<p>“Do you still have more alternatives?”</p>\n<p>Bhela thought for a second. She shook her head in embarrassment.</p>\n<p>“Our sect will gladly help your family, young lady. We don’t force you to join us or anything, just Eldest Young Lady will be sad if you act like strangers.”</p>\n<p>“I will write something for Sis Ryntia. I’ll promise I’ll pay the favor that I owe in the future.”</p>\n<p>“Eldest Young Lady will be waiting. And if nothing else… then,” the maidservant laid out a purple-ish colored bottle on the table, “please carry this for your protection, Young Lady Bhela.”</p>\n<p>Bhela studied the bottle. She couldn’t help but confused by the sudden gesture. “May I ask… what this bottle does?”</p>\n<p>“It’s our sect finest elixir for an exorcism.”</p>\n<p>“Exorcism?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, and it’s very potent. Remember yesterday’s explosion coming from Yashura Family’s area?”</p>\n<p>Bhela blinked. Yesterday, there was indeed a commotion about an explosion coming from Yashura Family’s place. But Bhela didn’t expect that was caused by a simple bottle like this.</p>\n<p>“Yashura Family hosts a very powerful… and very evil Nalaq, young lady. Young Master Shira Yashura even benefited a lot from having a connection with him.”</p>\n<p>“He does?” Bhela tightened her brow.</p>\n<p>“The rumors of him being a useless Level 3 Novice is already obsolete since that Nalaq gave him many good things.”</p>\n<p>“This is unexpected,” Bhela said with displeased tone, “Yashura Family had always been upright for years.”</p>\n<p>“I can’t really say about Young Master Shira’s character, all I can say is that this Nalaq is a bad news. Our sisters have fallen victim to him many times. And as for you, Young Lady Bhela--” the maidservant stopped as her eyes swam to assess Bhela’s charming figure, “--you’re the type that the Nalaq likely to harass.”</p>\n<p>Bhela’s face slightly perturbed.</p>\n<p>“Yes, even the Eldest Young Lady is very concerned of your safety ever since she received the news of our sisters getting assaulted…”</p>\n<p>“Were the victims okay?”</p>\n<p>“They were okay since they escaped rather quickly as soon as the evil Nalaq showed himself. They are a group of professional, after all.”</p>\n<p>“Then I can only say my thanks again for your concern. I owe you twice today.”</p>\n<p>The maid servant nodded.</p>\n<p>“It seems I’m overstay your grace today, young lady. My sisters need me back for a mission today,” before she turned back, the maidservant gave Bhela one last warning. “No matter what, young lady, please protect your back against that evil Nalaq.”</p>\n<p>“My back, yes, I will take extra care of my back--”</p>\n<p>“No, young lady. Your back. Protect it well. I mean it.”</p>\n<p>“O-okay…?” Bhela tilted her head in confusion. Did the maidservant tried to warn her that the evil Nalaq would come at the most unexpected direction--that was, her back? Looking at the maidservant’s serious face, she wasn't so sure anymore.</p>\n<p>Even after the maidservant and Elder Shyla went back to Elzhier Family, Bhela still dazed staring at the exorcism elixir in her hand. Around an hour after that, Lyla returned, only because her legs were tired chasing the rabbit all over the place. Bhela dazedly staring still at the elixir.</p>\n<p>“Yashura Family…” she murmured. Recalling a boy who was supposed to be her fiancé, her brows tightened, “having a contact with an evil Nalaq… what did he planned to do?”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A certain young master of the major family planned to get rich so that he had the chance to live a slow life as the Yashura Family’s patriarch in the future. Beyond that, he planned nothing.</p>\n<p>And the supposed evil Nalaq, who brought himself by the name of Good-Natured Spirit, was basking in the sun while carelessly enjoying a painting of lady that got her bottom raised in an erotic pose. He was in the mood to appreciate women’s heavenly butts, thanks to the feisty unwanted visitors who blasted him with exorcism elixir. As a gentleman as Good-Natured was, he couldn’t get mad toward beautiful ladies--especially those with big boobs and big butts. Instead, he yearned to get to know them better.</p>\n<p>“Man, those girls from Big Boobed Sect likely won’t come here for a while…” Good-Natured Spirit sighed. He rolled the semi-porn painting he had and put it inside a bag, which seemed magically swallowing the painting in spite of its small size. Then he picked up the cigarette he left on top of a rock, inhaling it for all the smoke worth left. He cocked up his head upside. Like an enlightened monkey, Shira Yashura tangled himself upside down on a tree branch, his eyes calmly closed.</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit ground the cigarette he had against the rock. “How is it?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“I think I’m ready to level up,” Shira said, slowly opening his eyes.</p>\n<p>He wasn’t talking about his level as a Novice. But about a peculiar <b>passive skill</b> he got from Good-Natured Spirit, of which he won by a fair game of chess about three months ago.</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit stood up. As a Nalaq, he usually floated, yet his feet glued to the ground as if the gravity once again accepted him as a living being that had a body mass.</p>\n<p>“Come down a sec, let me test you.” After he said that, Good-Natured Spirit stomped the earth with his right foot. Three pebbles with similar sizes jumped, floating on the air, then wrapped by the same bluish aura as the hollowing energy that shrouded the Nalaq with. He grabbed the pebbles with a sweep of his hand--they reappeared between Good-Natured Spirit’s fingers hollow, with a trace of ethereal quality, the trait of objects that only spiritual beings like Nalaqs could interact with.</p>\n<p>Shira, with his hairs tangled upside down by the gravity, asked with a frown, “You’re not trying to kill me, are you?”</p>\n<p>“You’re saying you scared by pebbles?” Good-Natured Spirit scoffed.</p>\n<p>“You heard the saying, right?”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit groaned. “Stop. I don’t like it when you’re being a smartass.”</p>\n<p>“The saying goes,” Shira, closing his eyes again, said, “a single pebble could take a life if thrown by a brainless Nalaq.”</p>\n<p>“It’s <em>thrown by a</em> <em>careless person</em>, you little fuck,” Good-Natured Spirit scowled. “Come down here so that I can see your progress on <b>Water Flowing Style</b>.”</p>\n<p>Shira jumped from tree branch with a three hundred sixty degree flip--a move which a year ago he couldn’t hope to achieve. The <b>Water Flowing Style</b> Good-Natured Spirit gave him improved his athletic skill by a very large margin. But applied on him, a boy who’d rather use his brain than muscles, the result wasn’t that apparent if seen by untrained eyes. He never really used the skills he got from winning the bet against Good-Natured Spirit. That changed since he had a duel to fight with the Young Master of Blackwood Family.</p>\n<p>“Really, I bet there’s going to be a ton of people coming to watch the duel, I need a way to get defeated in a way that won’t bring shame to Yashura Family…” he murmured.</p>\n<p>“You’re talking about that duel? The one with that shitty face Blackgood-whut-you-call-it guy? Why defeat, though? Just smash his damn face, really, it’s easy if you wanted to.”</p>\n<p>“It’s weird you called him ‘shitty face’, when that noble’s face resembles yours.”</p>\n<p>“You said he looks like this handsome me?”</p>\n<p>“I really thought he’s your descendant or something. Both the same--face and shamelessness alike.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit snorted. Ignoring the impudent boy, he then came back asking him, “You can mess that Blackdood guy’s face, even if you’re a shitty Level 3 Novice. Anything is possible with the help of this Ol’ Good Natured-Spirit. Seriously, I mean it. You believe me kiddo?”</p>\n<p>“No.”</p>\n<p>“Ey, this is where you should reply with a ‘how’. Really, I tell you, if you follow my lead, I can give you a power beyond the <b>System</b>.”</p>\n<p>“Ohhh…” Shira nodded unenthusiastically.</p>\n<p>The power beyond the <b>System</b> only occured in myths. Level and Classes that had been the foundation of many orders, the systematic stats, said to be relevant and useless in front of it. Shira, as a rational young man, of course believed the possibility of this chaotic power beyond the order--but coming from this Nalaq, knowing from experience, Shira felt it was complete bullshit.</p>\n<p>“I knew you were interested,” Good-Natured Spirit crossed his arms, smirked, “this is a training program I made myself. I called it ‘Training of Hell’. This is where you’re acquiring a cheat-like power, after all. Hence the cool name. By utilizing my thirteen thousands years of experience and knowledge, atop of the hellish sessions of training where you’ll tread in situations between life and death--”</p>\n<p>“Nope, not interested. You’re going to lead me to death, aren’t you?”</p>\n<p>“I need your soul intact in order to possess you. Why the fuck I’m going to do with your body if you’re dead?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know, perhaps you’re holding a grudge after losing repeatedly in a game you brought on your own.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit stared at him. “I don’t like it when you look like you’re being a smartass.”</p>\n<p>Shira shrugged. Ignoring the Nalaq, he took his stance.</p>\n<p>“A’right, I’mma test you on your Water Flowing Style, then.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit prepared to flick his pebbles. And Shira didn’t plan to get hit. Although he only mastered Level 2 Water Flowing Style, Shira could already feel confidence seeped through his pores, a degree of confidence that almost to the point of euphoria, something that he almost never experienced himself.</p>\n<p>“Yyooouuurrr sstaanceee--”</p>\n<p>His sense being dragged in slow motion? Shira blinked, but he really did hear and really did see the time stretching as Good-Natured Spirit uttered something--</p>\n<p>“--issss shiitttyyy.”</p>\n<p><em>Whhoooshh!</em></p>\n<p>The Nalaq flicked one pebble with his thumb. The pebble that infused with his bluish aura bolted through the air, slowly--no, it was as swift as a flying arrow but Shira’s perception caught the projectile in a slow motion manner.</p>\n<p>Something coming deep from his subconscious, taking over his body seamlessly, then sending command to his motoric nervous system to slightly bending sideways--the flying pebble shot through the space between his arm and hip.</p>\n<p>“Nnneeexxttt--”</p>\n<p>The second and the third pebbles were coming. And like before, Shira avoid them in an effortless manner, moving only a mere inch more than it needed not to get hit by the Nalaq’s pebbles.</p>\n<p>He managed to dodge both. But the last pebble, as Shira had to continue the Water Flowing Style’s flow, made him to spin one hundred eighty degrees backward. It was only afterward Shira realized the Nalaq forced him to turn his back on as the fourth pebble came and knocked his head.</p>\n<p>“Kg-uggh!” Shira hissing as he rubbed his head. “Why the hell? It's supposed to be three.”</p>\n<p>“When did I say I’ll throw three pebbles? But this is for your own good, y’know. Do you get the moral story about the fourth pebble?”</p>\n<p>“What is it?”</p>\n<p>“If you’re trying to be a smartass, you’ll get fucked up indefinitely.”</p>\n<p>“You asshole.”</p>\n<p>“Ey, is that how you’re supposed to say to a revered Nalaq?”</p>\n<p>“You said you’re not a Nalaq yourself.”</p>\n<p>“Now, now, let’s not so hasty reverted back to being a smartass again, will we? Lest, more ‘accident’ might happen… ‘kay?”</p>\n<p>“Ughh…” Shira was fed up dealing with this Nalaq. “I’m going home.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit shrugged, then he rested his back on a tree. Shira thought a Nalaq couldn’t be more carefree than Good-Natured Spirit. From his mystic bag, Good-Natured Spirit took out a new painting that was more inappropriate than the one from before. He said to Shira, “Don’t forget to exercise your breathing, Water Flowing Style is all about your breath. Level 3 Water Flowing Style is on another whole level that Level 2. You already feel the difference, no?”</p>\n<p>Although Good-Natured Spirit’s advice rarely did good--most turned out to be pranks, actually--this time Shira did feel the passive skill Good-Natured Spirit taught him had some sort of mysterious effect back when he dodged the Nalaq’s pebbles. Upon returning to Yashura Family, he decided to look for a Specialist who would show his <b>Stats Window</b>--the one who would do it free for him would be his cousin, Mila Yashura.</p>\n<p>“Pah! How come your Wisdom goes up yet again? How many times do I have to tell you, you’ve got to have some muscles, put your effort on raising Strength and Agility!”</p>\n<p>Yet, although it was free, it didn’t mean it wouldn’t incur any cost. If he wasn't careful Mila would nag him with full power, which depending on the weather and how the wind shifting her mood, the nagging could last half a day. Shira sighed inside his heart, if he knew Mila was on that time of the moon today, he would use his own money to get his Stats checked. Only, the last time he used outsider Specialist’s service, everyone in the village immediately knew that he was the only teen that still wasn’t better than ten years old kids.</p>\n<p>“Where are you going?” Mila crossed her arms when seeing that Shira trying to escape.</p>\n<p>“I haven’t done my share of today’s chores. Uncle and aunt have done so much for me… I’ll be doing my part of filial duty and do some errands right now….”</p>\n<p>“Errands? You meant goofing around in the market?”</p>\n<p>Shira groaned. If Mila was like this, he knew from experience the she wouldn’t let him off easily.</p>\n<p>“Go to the field training, you’ve got to learn handling wooden swords,” Mila said. “Forget about errands. If you at least show even the slightest bit of motivation on preparing for your upcoming duel, then I’ll talk to my father about exempting you on daily chores.”</p>\n<p>“I’ve been preparing myself, though.”</p>\n<p>“What did you do?”</p>\n<p>“I’ve been training on this wonderful skill called Water Flowing Style from a certain… mmm… master…?”</p>\n<p>“Why fuck you tilting your head for? What kind of stupid master was willing to train you when all you do all day was lazing around alone on the hill?”</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t alone,” Shira said solemnly, “the Venerable Good Nalaq is always with me.”</p>\n<p>Hearing the Nalaq was mentioned, Mila sucked the deepest breath out of her life.</p>\n<p>Seeing that Mila subconsciously took a step backward, Shira didn’t let her off the hook. He turned his body and bowed apologetically to an empty air, said, “I’m very sorry about my cousin’s rude mouth, Sir Venerable Good Nalaq… she’s always dumb like this and never put any attention to her wording.”</p>\n<p>Mila, although usually thoughtless of the consequence of her behaviour, she wasn’t born stupid. She knew very well the result of angering a revered Nalaq. Because of that, she immediately dropped her knees kneeling and begged for forgiveness. She begged forgiveness from the empty air.</p>\n<p>“Have mercy, Sir Venerable Good Nalaq! I never thought you were so kind to bless this ignorant cousin of mine with your boundless knowledge. I’m very sorry to offend you with my uncouth mouth!”</p>\n<p>Shira then pretended listened to the empty air, nodding off his head. “Mm. Sir Venerable Good Nalaq said you’re the one who were stupid.”</p>\n<p>“Yes! Yes, I’m the one who was stupid! Let me punish myself by eating dirt so that I can appease Sir Venerable Good Nalaq!”</p>\n<p>“Eh, you don’t have to do that,” Shira could see Mila was her father’s daughter. Even though in everyday’s life their personality completely different, sometimes, they just naturally alike in some aspects. “Just leave me alone for now. Sir Venerable Good Nalaq said the things he bestowed upon me are secret that he doesn’t want anyone to know.”</p>\n<p>Shira could see Mila nodded in retreat. But knowing the girl’s personality, she’d find another reason to bother him by the end of the day.</p>\n<p>He turned, only to find out that Butler Yulong saw all that happened. His expression was ugly.</p>\n<p>“Uhh… Yulong, I think Sir Venerable Good Nalaq…”</p>\n<p>Shira’s words were dragging, Yulong cut him off before he finished his sentence.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Mila acts like that because she worries about you, young master. You shouldn’t have teased her like that.”</p>\n<p>Yulong had always been kind, the wrinkled smile he had always gave the impression of a gentle old grandpa. Butler Yulong always been responsible for his education more than his own father, who was rarely in Badril Village, and his uncle Shuro, who was taking care of him as the guardian. Therefore, whenever he got angry, Shira knew he’d better listened to him.</p>\n<p>Around that time, not far from Badril Village, a small coach took its time journeying through the mountainous road.</p>\n<p>The coach was a gray-haired middle-aged man, with magic sword on his belt, acting as the sole bodyguard for the two people inside. A mid-twenty young man was found sleeping there, while the other one, a girl around Mila’s age, was killing time by reading a lite novel.</p>\n<p>“Hmm?” the girl found herself frowning, in spite of the novel’s content which was lighthearted romance. The man also felt a subtle change in her expression, forcing himself awake, became alert immediately. Ever since the girl made contract with her Nalaq, her own expression wasn’t necessarily reflecting her own emotion alone.</p>\n<p>“Something wrong, Merly?” the young man asked.</p>\n<p>With her fingers on her chin, still frowning, the girl replied, “Mama Ross tells me this place weirdly secure.”</p>\n<p>The coach on the front replied instead, “Road to Badril Village is safe, young lady. A ferocious group of Road Warriors had been watching this route for about twenty years now.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, for twenty years straight? Badril Village sure has some dedicated good Samaritans protecting their livelihood. I wonder if Yurin Family would be able to employ them,” the young man pondered.</p>\n<p>“Haha, you can ask them, young master. Don’t you say you’re about to visit a family called Yashura, today? The founder of that Road Warriors is a man named Jhuro Yashura. He's been retired for fifteen years now, but still got enough influence to move his gang around--that’s the kind of man this Jhuro fellow is.”</p>\n<p>“Hoo… if that’s true, even if Teacher Staterwind doesn’t get his third student here, our journey should be still worthwhile,” the man nodded in satisfaction. As a young master from a merchant family, he long knew how precious diligent Road Warriors to secure trading route in southern land infested with monsters and rogue bandits.</p>\n<p>“Merly, why are you still frowning?” he asked the girl.</p>\n<p>“Mama Ross said… it’s not about bandits, but an ancient formation. It was set here. Strong enough to hold against bombardment of Mages’ artilleries.”</p>\n<p>It was almost as if the venerable Nalaq said this place was going to be an upcoming place for war. The man was silent hearing that. The coach, however, was a little doubtful, but he was polite when pointing out since the other party was a girl contracted with a venerable Nalaq. “That’s weird, Young Lady Merly. We’re far away from the border, and sure there’s no fortress built around here.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know, Norman. Mama Ross the one who said that.”</p>\n<p>The coach, Norman, could only nodded his head if the venerable Nalaq inside Merly’s body the one who insisted.</p>\n<p>They arrived at Badril Village about one hour later. Because the coach was made with a good wood, the party of Yurin Family was mistaken as the second visiting noble. The village head even enthusiastically welcomed them. The village head was disappointed, however, after knowing the new visitors were just random kids from a rich merchant family--since the Blackwood Family came, village head wanted to be the one who welcomed the noble, somehow.</p>\n<p>After asking around, the girl and the young man finally reunited with their teacher. Sir Baront rent them rooms at the inn he stayed. Then they came to discuss their business in the village.</p>\n<p>“The Nalaq in this village doesn’t want to meet with Madame Ross,” Baront Staterwind said hesitantly, afraid he offending the Nalaq who resided inside his disciple’s body, “so I think we’ll try to talk a bit more with Yashura Family. They’re the one that host the Nalaq and their young master likely to be soul contracted. Jerrin, Merly, I’ll ask both of you cooperate with me later.”</p>\n<p>The young man was Jerrin Yurin, a Level 19 Acolyte studied under Sir Baront Staterwind for seven years, while the girl, Merly Yurin, was a Level 10 Acolyte--a bit late bloomer considering she hailed from a rich merchant family, where access to resource like Boost Elixir was abundant. Today, they came to Badril Village under their teacher’s summon, discussing the possibility of designating Sir Baront’s third disciple.</p>\n<p>“I do think they take us too lightly,” Jerrin said, not with an angry tone, but weren’t exactly sounded satisfied either. “I don’t have a contract with a Nalaq yet, but Merly’s got Madame Ross with her. Even noble families received us with better treatment than this.”</p>\n<p>“Jerrin, you’ve got to understand, Yashura Family has an unidentified Nalaq living in their backyard--it’s understandable for them to worry more about a Nalaq that been living with them than us outsiders.”</p>\n<p>The door knocked. Norman came to report of his findings about the soon-to-be third disciple.</p>\n<p>“I’ve compiled a few points about Young Master Yashura that I deem important, please read this.” If nothing went wrong during their visit in Yashura Family, and Mama Ross approved the Nalaq from the other side, considering their teacher’s good mood, it was very likely that Jerrin and Yurin would receive the third younger brother to study under Blue Robe Society with them. So the coach was tasked to gather information about Shira. Although a Knight usually involved of crude fighting, duel, skirmishing, and occasional ball parties, the gray-haired man unexpectedly adept at information gathering due to his rich experience in guerilla warfare.</p>\n<p>Reading the report, they noticed he was already engaged, which quite an unusual practice in southern lands. Merly knew the fiancée was, she remarked that, due to her promising talent and her rare Unique Class, Bhela Malikh was a celebrity during Merly’s trip in the seminars. Merly knew her from the rumors and stories her friends share with her, but hadn’t had the chance to meet with the said person because with Mama Ross’s existence, her schedule during the seminars was quite different than everyone else. Jerrin didn’t know that, but then Sir Barront told the story about what had happened in Malikh Family’s ngajen ceremony. Both of the disciples naturally formed their opinions.</p>\n<p>“Both of you don’t have to worry, although on the surface this boy’s talent can’t be considered good, but I’ve met with him already. I can say that he’s a sensible young man.”</p>\n<p>“You’re right, Teacher Staterwind. The best talent an Acolyte of Blue Robe Society could have is to get favored by a Nalaq. He’s already far ahead than an uncontracted Acolyte like me in terms of talent and luck,” Jerrin said, jokingly mocked himself.</p>\n<p>Yet although both the disciples weren’t satisfied with Shira’s low talent, spending time in Blue Robe Society, they understood that level and stats weren’t that import for an Acolyte with soul contract--the binding and conditions of their contract, along with their contracted Nalaq’s power, was what really matters.</p>\n<p>Letting Jerrin and Merly spending two hours resting in the inn, Sir Baront Staterwind then sent someone to inform Yashura Family that they were coming. He knew Yashura Family was quite prepared with a banquet already, but a reminder wouldn’t hurt.</p>\n<p>“This Yashura Family… are they living in the west or the east of the village?” Merly asked, a moment after they descended the inn’s stairs.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront replied. “They’re on the east side. Yashura Family owns almost all the lands there. Why did you ask?”</p>\n<p>“Mama Ross is concerned with something.”</p>\n<p>The coach replied, “Young Lady Merly, Yashura Family is on the east side, while there are two families on the west side--Malikh and Elzhier. From what the locals said, those three major families seem to be normal.”</p>\n<p>“Mama Ross doesn’t want us to mess with people in the west side,” Merly said, “but coming to the east, she’s not sure…”</p>\n<p>There was nothing out of the ordinary when the party approached Yashura Family. But Merly Yurin found herself hesitate in taking another step forward--she felt Mama Ross’s restlessness inside of her. She straightened her head. An old butler was already standing by to welcome them.</p>\n<p>“Welcome to Yashura Family,” Yulong said as he bowed his body. “We’ve prepared a little banquet to honor dear guests, please do follow me to the family hall.”</p>\n<p>Sir Baront and Jerrin Yurin were often travelled the southern lands and experienced in being visitors of many families, thus they replied the greeting smoothly. The coach, however, saw from the back of the party the Young Lady Merly’s figure consciously avoid the butler. The coachman kept his finding to himself. In addition, he saw the butler realized the awkward gesture too, but Norman thought nothing of it.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>For families of the southern Mossack that always throwing hearty feasts for whichever reasons they could come up with, serving beef on the table could be considered grand and lavish. Yashura Family were bigger rancher than Elzhier and Malikh Family combined, and they had the biggest plots of land in Badril Village, yet, a family this big, would only butcher cows only if the harvests of their rice paddies and other fields were abundant.</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro Yashura spared no effort for this day, didn’t sleep all night just to prepare his best <em>rendang</em> for the guests. He put his soul as he slowly poured coconut milk over the cooking beef, giving all of his concentration to create a <em>rendang</em> that even better than all the <em>rendang</em> he made, combined. Wiping his brows, he looked toward the clear sky. Patriarch Shuro Yashura hoped that his Yashura Family could send their heir to study overseas like the young ladies from Elzhier and Malikh Family had--and, of course, he also hoped that there weren’t going to be an accident worse than yesterday's explosion would happen today.</p>\n<p>In the family hall of Yashura Family, that afternoon.</p>\n<p>Yashura Family welcomed the guests with a banquet, the Mossack way. Plates and bowls full of exotic traditional foods were grouped and stacked on the floor, while the host and the guests would sitting cross-legged in circle.</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro was a hardcore Mossack. When his family’s fate hanged upon the balance, he believed a good talk and good food would solve any problem.</p>\n<p>Even though Yashura Family was big, to show the sincerity of the host and to avoid the political atmosphere, for this occasion Patriarch Shuro decided the ones that humor the guests were only his close family--him, his wife, his sole daughter, and his nephew, Shira. Sir Barront Staterwind sat cross-legged on the opposite side, with his two disciples sat each beside him, and a servant gray-haired middle-aged man sat calmly behind them. Jerrin Yurin, the older one, was originally an extravert, the kind that could always conjure a conversion out of the trivialest things. So he drove the light talks around bountiful southern harvests and foods, a kind of talk that Patriarch Shuro particularly fond of. Besides learning about the designated third disciple, Jerrin and Merly also unexpectedly learned a lot about coconuts, thanks to Patriarch Shuro’s passionate knowledge in the field of coconuts.</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro was too carried away by the conversation that he seemingly didn’t realize the odd air happened beside him. His nephew, Shira, had a hard time on his own. The boy could feel the girl beside Sir Barront, who happened at the same age as Mila, scrutinized him with studying eyes. Occasionally, the talkative young man named Jerrin Yurin would directed a few questions toward him, he read the subtle nuance and also realized, within the few of those seemingly trivial questions, the man was actually trying to figure him out. Shira thought he answered the questions in a safe way. And Jerrin also seemed to see him as a harmless fifteen years old boy, as he lost his hidden alertness in his tone and began to chat normally with him.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, however, Shira didn’t see the supposed high status Nalaq. Either Sir Barront and his disciples didn’t plan to engage seriously this afternoon, or the mysterious Nalaq sat back with a wait and see attitude, but all this made Shira couldn’t help but think that the prospect for him to study with these folks wasn’t as sweet as his uncle Patriarch Shuro previously told him.</p>\n<p>“I have a question for you,” Merly Yurin for the first time talked to Shira. The older folks who were enjoying a hearty chat then stopped and focused their attention to the girl.</p>\n<p>“What questions do you have for me, Young Lady Yurin? I’ll answer the best I could.”</p>\n<p>“Is it true that you are engaged to Bhela with surname of Malikh?”</p>\n<p>“Oh,” Shira was taken aback a little bit. Since the other party asked about this topic, surely they knew about the ruckus that happened during Malikh Family’s ngajen ceremony. “The whole thing was planned before even I could barely talk.”</p>\n<p>“Ehem,” Patriarch Shuro cleared his phlegm, as he always knew this nephew of his always being too blunt whenever the topic of his engagement was brought out of the blue. “Young Lady Yurin, the thing is, Shira’s father and the patriarch of Malikh Family were as close as brothers, so when they each had a baby boy and a baby girl, they thought it was a good idea for Yashura and Malikh to be together.” The patriarch saw his well-thought explaining didn’t received well, thus awkwardly added, “That’s how it is, really. The engagement actually wasn’t a big deal before Patriarch Malikh’s daughter got chosen as a candidate to attend a fancy seminars backed by lots of royal families and big clans.”</p>\n<p>“I did attend the fancy seminars you’re talking about, Patriarch Yashura,” Merly said, her tone was a bit sour. “I reckon everyone in this village knows her real worth by now. Even during the seminars, Bhela Malikh is a celebrity amongst the students. She has a real talent and she always worked hard to back it up.”</p>\n<p>Shira smiled. Whenever that annoying topic came up, faking a smile was the only thing he could do.</p>\n<p>“Honestly, I balked at how sloppy your current talent is,” Merly continued, “even if a boy coming from a very poor family, at least getting to Level 6 at your age isn’t really a problem. But you, a healthy fifteen years old, who is the heir of the village’s major family, is unable to even ascend to a mere Level 4 Novice--honestly, honestly…”</p>\n<p>Merly took out a scroll from her sleeve. The Yashura Family wasn’t too surprised for the guests to investigate Shira, but to show it blatantly was really too much to bear. “I don’t know what to say about this,” Merly sighed. “Your <b>Wisdom</b> far outweigh your other attributes. People say Stats only are numbers when it comes to the realm of men and earth, and I think they have one thing correct about a high number of <b>Wisdom</b> doesn’t actually mean the person is wise. Not in this case, anyway. Have you ever considered how your position of an heir and a fiancé of well-known best talent of this generation? Coarse attributes like <b>Strength</b> and **Agility **are the easiest to raise, and the most effective way to level up--yet, after seeing your current <b>Stats</b> is, even the most ignorant one can see that you didn’t even try.”</p>\n<p>The room fell silent. Patriarch Shuro Yashura opened his mouth, but closed before he made a sound. Even Mila, the one that first to defend her cousin during Malikh Family’s ngajen ceremony, lowered her head, feeling embarrassed herself--Merly did poked at the right wound. Naturally Shira also was silent. He knew if he opened his mouth now, the only thing that he could say only lame excuses.</p>\n<p>In the end, it was Patriarch Shuro’s wife who opened her mouth and explained, “This… Young Lady Yurin… it’s not like nephew Shira is too lazy to bother about it…”</p>\n<p>“Cough, he is, a bit… cough…” Patriarch Shuro, who felt guilty about lying, murmured between his fake cough. His wife elbowed from the side, the patriarch then acted as if he didn’t say anything.</p>\n<p>“Ever since Shira’s a baby he’s a bit too sensitive and can easily get sick,” Madam Yashura continued explaining for her nephew. “His mother left him the moment he was born, and at the time he couldn’t drink milk from wet nurses. There was an old doctor who Shira’s father brought from outside the village that always checked on him, and he said to stabilize Shira’s condition he needed to suppress his manasphere from being active--thus, his talent growth over the years hasn’t been very satisfying.” Madam Yashura sighed. “Remembering back all those years ago, honestly, it’s already a blessing that he’s still able to keep his life. He was pitiful, this kid…”</p>\n<p>Shira unfortunately sat beside his aunt, he got his hair ruffled in a very embarrassing way.</p>\n<p>On the other side, Merly was silent as if she pondering, and Sir Barront quickly assured the family that Blue Robe Society regarded the contract with Nalaq more important than the students’ own talents. Jerrin, however, quietly glanced back from his shoulder, asking to verify the story from the person who had personally investigated the boy; Norman nodded his head telling something like that really did happen.</p>\n<p>At this point, Shira knew his chances of being accepted was already screwed. He didn’t know the details, but he realized the girl, who happened to be the youngest of the guests, held even heftier voice than her own teacher--instead of apologizing to Yashura Family, Sir Baront would make the words that came out of her mouth nicer if that wasn’t the case.</p>\n<p>A moment later, Merly continued with her sharp words as if she was numb to the awkward atmosphere. “If this boy has a disability, why that Nalaq chose him then?”</p>\n<p>That, even Madam Yashura could only glance Shira with question mark.</p>\n<p>Merly said, “Any Nalaq won’t choose any human without any redeeming quality to contract with. That is because the Nalaq will possess him after the contract ends, and will live in the human’s place until the mortal body rots. I have an outstanding affinity with fire elemental, enough to ensure me achieving Rank-3 Fire Mage in the future, but that only gives me 60 years worth of contract with my Nalaq, Mama Ross, who happened to be a great Fire Mage herself in the past,” Merly took a beat, looking straight at Shira’s eyes. “Surely, the Nalaq of yours sees something different in you that interested him. If you can convince us what’s so good about you, maybe Mama Ross will favor you a bit when she confronts this Nalaq.”</p>\n<p>Shira didn’t like the girl’s tone. But he decided to reply her since he wanted to save some face for his uncle. However, the more he thought about it, the more mysterious it was to decipher Good-Natured Spirit’s thought. Why he came to Shira in the first place?</p>\n<p>“Well…” Shira murmured.</p>\n<p>“Well?”</p>\n<p>“Maybe it’s because…” the only desire Good-Natured Spirit ever showed was worldly vulgar desire of women. Shira’s mind was thinking fast; Good-Natured Spirit was a ghost, so he couldn’t touch women unless he got a mortal body. Yet, a mere body wouldn’t make a womanizer Nalaq so desperate he willing to lose again and again waging countless games of chess. There ought something that made Good-Natured Spirit desperate to get him, and it had something to do with getting women with the mortal body of his. Finally, he reached a conclusion. “Maybe because I’m handsome?”</p>\n<p>“COUGH!” Mila loudly faked a cough.</p>\n<p>Her father and mother coughs followed suit.</p>\n<p>“Cough cough cough!”</p>\n<p>“Cough cough!”</p>\n<p>“COUGH COUGH COUGH!!!”</p>\n<p>Mila and her parents wanted to cover Shira’s lame answer with their coughing. But it was unlucky for them that the guests already heard it, loud and clear.</p>\n<p>Even the cordial Sir Barront and his disciple Jerring didn’t know what to say. Meanwhile, Merly frowned, the previous charm she bore with her had gone as she sourly said, “Your confident is too much. You should’ve look yourself in front of a mirror.”</p>\n<p>Shira had enough of this rude girl. He wasn’t this fed up when she stood in front of that unlikable young noble of Blackwood Family. For southern people, being taken lightly as a host was horrible, it was a common sense for Mossack descents scowled at ungrateful guests. This must how Bhela Malikh felt when Mila brazenly asking her to a duel in her own courtyard.</p>\n<p>Thus, frowning himself, Shira said with an impatient tone, “That was the only plausible answer I could give you based on my understanding of his personality. If you really wanted to know his reason too much, why don’t you go ask him yourself?”</p>\n<p>“S-Shira!” Mila cried. She looked at he parents; Patriarch Shuro was pale. He decided to be silent, pretending as if he was a block of wood. Then, nervously, Mila glanced at the line of the esteemed guests, saw that Sir Barront sighed as he shook his head, Jerrin looked at Shira with a trace of pity, while Merly glared the boy with scornful eyes.</p>\n<p>Merly said slowly as her eyes still locked on the youth, “This settles it. The one that approaches you isn’t a proper Nalaq--he isn’t even a low-ranked one.”</p>\n<p>Shira raised his eyebrows.</p>\n<p>“If it was a proper Nalaq,” Merly continued, “then you should’ve realized you’re talking to another one by now.”</p>\n<p>After Merly said that, she lowered her head, closing her eyes, seemingly fell into a sudden slumber. Mystical smoke puffed out behind her back, slowly condensed into an ethereal womanly figure. A face formed, she was exceedingly beautiful, and she was frowning; she had the same scornful gaze at Shira Yashura.</p>\n<p>“Greeting, Venerable Madame Ross!” Sir Barront Staterwind was the first one to prostate and gave his greeting. Jerrin also turned to face Mama Ross and began prostrating.</p>\n<p>Seeing the guests reaction, Patriarch Shuro who already gave up his hope on his nephew’s prospect was startled. It took a beat for him to realize his nephew had done much more damage than getting his chance of accepted as Sir Barront’s disciple.</p>\n<p>“I am very sorry for my nephew’s impudence, Venerable Madame Nalaq!” Patriarch Shuro cried as soon as he slammed his forehead upon the mat covered floor, prostrating submissively. “Please don’t punish my ignorant nephew, if you wanted to punish someone then please punish this old me!”</p>\n<p>“No!” beside him, his daughter Mila Yashura slammed her forehead harder. “My father done no wrong! It was me who failed to guide my younger cousin even though I have the chances! It was me! It was me who was responsible! Please punish just me!”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro raised his head in disbelief; tears welled in his eyes as he gazed at the prostrating figure of his stubborn daughter. “Mila… what are you saying?” his voice was trembling, “the responsibility for guiding a youngster falls to his own parents and guardians only… you’ve done no wrong, daughter…”</p>\n<p>His eyes filled absolute decision; he was a father, an uncle, and the sole patriarch of Yashura Family. It was him who was supposed to take the whole responsibility.</p>\n<p>BAM!</p>\n<p>“I’m the one who was wrong!” Patriarch Shuro cried so loud that his voice echoed inside the family hall. “Please punish me as you see fit!”</p>\n<p>As his forehead kissed the floor mat, Patriarch Shuro closed his eyes, waiting for the hammer of punishment descend upon him. However--</p>\n<p>BAAM!</p>\n<p>Mila’s cry shrieked even louder than her father’s. “My father is stupid! The only knowledge he ever bestowed upon my ignorant cousin is useless trivia about damned coconuts! He’s not fit to guide anyone! It was me who supposed to guide Shira! But I failed! So please punish me!”</p>\n<p>BAAAMM!!</p>\n<p>“No, punish me!” Patriarch Shuro urged.</p>\n<p>BAAM!</p>\n<p>“No, me!” Mila cried.</p>\n<p>BAMM!!!</p>\n<p>“My daughter is confused, I’m the one who’s wrong!”</p>\n<p>BAAM!</p>\n<p>“Confused is better than being stupid! You’ll feel better if you’re just punish me!”</p>\n<p>Beside the ceaseless yelling, Madam Yashura also prostrating with her body trembling. Shira, although also prostrating himself, was calm like a stone in turbulent lake--it was impossible to read what was inside the head of his.</p>\n<p>Mama Ross originally didn’t care about this Yashura Family. But after seeing blood trickled on Mila’s forehead, Mama Ross sighed. The girl was the same age as her Merly Yurin. She couldn’t watch this stupid scene any longer.</p>\n<p>Thus, with a wave of her hand, she said, “Stop! I don’t plan to punish anyone.”</p>\n<p>Slowly, both Patriarch Shuro and Mila raised their heads, peeking nervously at Mama Ross’s mood.</p>\n<p>“It’s okay if Madame Ross said so,” in the end, it was Sir Baront’s words that made the pair father and daughter at ease.</p>\n<p>Mama Ross said, “When I’m still alive, the Mossack chiefs all had self-respect and would never beg others to punish themselves. I don’t know what had happened in these two thousand years, time sure regress man’s nature.”</p>\n<p>“I’m ashamed of my immature conduct,” Patriarch Shuro said, with his head lowered and his voice almost whimpering like a guilty puppy, “please do forgive this unworthy descendant of Mossack people…”</p>\n<p>“Stop that self-mockery. I don’t want to hear it anymore,” Mama Ross snorted. He then looked at the other members of Yashura Family who still prostrating on the floor. “More important… lift your heads, all of you.”</p>\n<p>Shira and his aunt raised their heads.</p>\n<p>Mama Ross said to Shira, “I see how awkward you are, child. You’re not familiar in greeting a Nalaq. That’s more evident for Staterwind’s wrong about the Nalaq with you is a low-ranked one, not to mention the fact that he’s afraid in meeting a proper high-ranked Nalaq like me.”</p>\n<p>Shira said nothing as he listened to Mama Ross’s prideful voice. As his family knew the existence of Good-Natured Spirit and knew that he was not so good-natured, though he didn’t know what would happen next, he knew for sure that he wouldn’t be able to exploit Good-Natured Spirit’s wallet from those chess games. This revelation saddened him greatly.</p>\n<p>While Mama Ross was rubbing the back of Merly’s neck, who slowly woken up from her daze because the possession before, the Nalaq caught the flash of regret in the Shira’s face.</p>\n<p>“I'm one of the few that responsible of many orders during the rebirth era of Tiramikal Continent,” Mama Ross said. “So I suppose I’ll help you if that rogue Nalaq really did make troubles. Consider this the payment for this afternoon meal and your hospitality.”</p>\n<p>Sir Barront Staterwind immediately said to Yashura Family, “Madame Ross is one of the pillars that oversaw Tiramikal Continent’s rebuilding after the Great Rebellion two thousands years ago--so she cares common people greatly. Sir Patriarch Yashura, quickly say your thanks to Madame Ross!”</p>\n<p>As if it was a competition, Patriarch Shuro and his daughter Mila threw their into the floor and yelled both at the same time, “Thank you very much, Venerable Madame Ross!”</p>\n<p>Shira and his aunt followed after, but their responses weren’t as excited as the pair of father and daughter.</p>\n<p>Merly was swaying in her sitting, Mama Ross then hugged her onto her chest. The lady Nalaq accepted the Yashura Family’s gratefulness with only a glance in the corner of her eyes--the scene of an ethereal spirit holding a girl dearly seemed picturesque, leaving the onlookers felt a hint of warmness inside them. Shira remembered Good-Natured Spirit had said that the only Nalaqs that could easily interact with living object and human beings were those with ridiculously high level talent in their real life--if two kinds of personalities like Good-Natured Spirit and Sir Baront Staterwind said the same thing, he reckon it must be true.</p>\n<p>“It seems Merly’s body still hasn’t adapted with temporary possession,” Mama Ross murmured, then she said without turning her eyes away from the girl, “Jerrin, you look somewhere for us to do combat training, this village must have somewhere good for us to train our sync.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, Madame Ross,” Jerrin Yurin eagerly replied. Although he was supposed to be Merly’s elder disciple and her older cousin, in reality, all he was doing these past month was accompanying and taking care Merly while she adapting with Mama Ross’s temporary possession--a technique of which developed quite sophisticatedly by Blue Robe Society.</p>\n<p>“Staterwind, Norman.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, Madame Ross?” Sir Barront and the coach and bodyguard for the Yurins waited for the order.</p>\n<p>“That rogue Nalaq must’ve been hiding now that I can’t feel his presence. Go look for his whereabouts!”</p>\n<p>“Yes!!”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro and his family felt nervous when he witnessed how decisive it looked when the lady Nalaq gave her orders. Especially the patriarch, although his looks seemed fierce like he was long engaged in banditry, this man couldn’t keep his calm and felt groveling on his knees was the more right thing to do.</p>\n<p>“Umm…” Only Shira who looked awkward, like he had something to say.</p>\n<p>“What is it, boy?” Mama Ross asked sharply as her hands patting Merly’s head.</p>\n<p>“I think that rogue Nalaq will meet you… Venerable Madame Ross…”</p>\n<p>“Oh? I’m being told that Nalaq doesn’t want to see me. What makes you think differently?”</p>\n<p>“Maybe Young Master Yashura began to see Madame Ross’s greatness,” Sir Baront Staterwind musing on the side.</p>\n<p>“Yes, I’m now sure the rogue Nalaq will be awed by Madame Ross’s greatness.”</p>\n<p>Shira lifted his head slightly, stealing a glance with a covertly manner. He didn’t see clearly before afraid he’d being rude, but now, he could see the picture of a girl comfortably resting her head on two great melon pillows.</p>\n<p>After they had lunch together they decided to take a break on the meeting. After vaguely praising the lady Nalaq for her big, great assets, Shira being tasked to fetch for Good-Natured and see if he could make the two Nalaq meet. The boy didn’t search him for too long since he was familiar with the spots where the Nalaq hung out alone to smoke his cigarettes.</p>\n<p>“Good-For-Nothing Spirit.”</p>\n<p>“Yo, what’s up, kiddo?”</p>\n<p>“The Nalaq I told you is in the family, now. She said she wants to meet you.”</p>\n<p>“Is this a high-ranking Nalaq you’re talking about?”</p>\n<p>“She said you’re a rogue Nalaq.”</p>\n<p>“Fuck no, no,” Good-Natured Spirit waved his hand, saying, “I don’t believe any this Nalaq worshipping bullshit. Anyone who calls themselves <em>proper</em> Nalaq is dead idiots with superiority complex who thinks they’re better because their names appeared in some fucking history books that practically no one read--the picture of you ignorant people grovelling everytime a Nalaq shows themselves is a puke-worthy sight to see. Fuck, don’t count me for this nonsense man. I’m outta here.”</p>\n<p>He stood up and began to float away.</p>\n<p>It seemed Good-Natured Spirit didn’t really like his kinds. But Shira already made a promise bringing him in front of Mama Ross; as the young master of Yashura Family, how could he bailed on his own words now?</p>\n<p>Shira’s expression thus became solemn.</p>\n<p>He said, “She’s got melons.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit slowing down.</p>\n<p>“She’s got big boobs and big butts,” Shira said again.</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit changed his course a total one-hundred-eighty degrees. “The fuck you’re dilly-dallying about? A lady’s waiting. Lead the way!”</p>\n<hr>\n","unregistered":[]},"novels/yashura-legacy/contents/volume-1/chapter-8.md":{"contributions":{},"lastModified":1589309289821,"data":{"title":"Evil Rogue Nalaq"},"body":"<p>The Yashura was a normal family in Badril Village, Norman’s investigations concluded to this. Yet the pair of Yurin cousins believed Yashura was anything but normal, simply because Mama Ross said so.</p>\n<p>On break from the meeting, Merly took an excuse to stroll Yashura Family’s place. The girl declined Patriarch Shuro’s offer to get a maidservant to accompany her, saying she could just ask direction to whoever she met when needed. She wasn’t alone, however, Mama Ross was inside her. Because the awkward mood from earlier, Patriarch Shuro and his family readily agreed, unaware that Mama Ross took the chance to investigate Yashura Family from inside out.</p>\n<p>“The ancient defensive formation’s heart should be around here,” Mama Ross whispered inside Merly’s mind. No one was around when they just arrived in Yashura Family’s garden.</p>\n<p>“Are you sure they have that kind of formation, Mama Ross?” Merly asked hesitantly, “they don’t seem the sophisticated kind.”</p>\n<p>“The current generation maybe simple, but their origin definitely not,” Mama Ross explained. “The fact that no experts guarding the family means their history is thinning out. Maybe the only real expert that living the standard of ancient Yashura is that Jhuro child Norman talked before.”</p>\n<p>“The kid’s father…” Merly mumbled.</p>\n<p>“Patriarch Shuro’s still in his prime age, there’s still a chance for him to get an heir from his own blood. Yet, even though his talent is hopeless, Shira Yashura’s position as the next patriarch is very stable. We should get Jhuro Yashura investigated to decide whether or not Yashura Family should be befriended.”</p>\n<p>“Yes.”</p>\n<p>Merly had been in a conversation with Mama Ross the entire time. If anyone was beside the girl then, they’d only see the girl talked alone to empty air.</p>\n<p>Mama Ross confirmed that the so-called Good-Natured Spirit wasn’t exactly a good fella, thus getting Young Master Shira Yashura into their Blue Robe Society was impossible. But Jerrin indicated he got interested in making a contact between the Yashura and Yurin, because they’d heard Norman spoke many good things about the man called Jhuro Yashura. In addition, Mama Ross also just discovered the formation she felt even before entering Badril Village actually came from this very garden. If the result of their investigation resulted in sactifactionary, then continuing their relationship with Yashura Family wouldn’t be a bad thing.</p>\n<p>“Mm, if Jerrin couldn’t get contracted with a Nalaq till he’s in his thirty, getting to know families and clans with ancient histories will help him get his chance for a patriarch seat instead,” Mama Ross said after a thought.</p>\n<p>“Thank you for helping my cousin all this time, Mama Ross,” Merly whispered, recalled Jerrin’s position as the family head’s successor was pretty bad before Mama Ross’s soul revived as a Nalaq.</p>\n<p>“I didn’t do much except for giving my approval, my dear. That child Jerrin already preparing a backup plan if his career in Blue Robe Society gets stuck. Knowing his personality, how could I not helping him?” Mama Ross sighed. Between Patriarch Yurin’s three sons, Mama Ross favored the youngest, Jerrin, who always eager to do menial tasks for her and Merly even though he had the position of senior disciple brother. “Anyway, that formation, I felt it resonating a bit from that direction. Go over there, Merly my dear.”</p>\n<p>What welcoming them was statue of a lion. Cracks were apparent on its moldy surface, yet the fierce roar the lion bragged suggested its unwillingness being defeated by the flow of time. Mama Ross couldn’t tell the exact year the statue being built, but the knowledge of an exhausting study about ancient Formations during her time helped her to guess the lion statue’s age. The venerable Nalaq found the lingering <em>mana</em> injected into the statue almost one hundred years old.</p>\n<p>Appearing out from Merly’s body, Mama Ross continued to study the lion statue with her brows knitted.</p>\n<p>“Quite unexpected. There are at least seven different minor supportive formations installed after the main defensive Formation!”</p>\n<p>Merly didn’t know about Art of Formation that much. But she could feel Mama Ross’s faint gasp of surprise, she instantly knew this finding was a big deal. “Is that very good, Mama Ross?”</p>\n<p>“At least today we know Yashura Family had a Formation genius two to three generations ago,” Mama Ross said solemnly. If Yurin Family could get a peek on this Formation genius’s legacy, Mama Ross wouldn’t be so worried about the two Yurin children whom she already took under her wings. “The mana applied is almost one hundred years old. But I suspect this statue way older than that; look here, Merly, the mana cast on the statue is seeped deep into the stone. One method to prolong a Formation’s lifespan is to cast it on an ancient object. And the mana applied seems to be layered, maybe someone has used it for something else before this statue became the heart of defensive Formation.”</p>\n<p>Merly asked, “Mama Ross means they have another secret like this? I heard there’s a well-respected bank goes with the name Yashura World Bank in the west of Tiramikal Continent. Is this family connected to them in some way?”</p>\n<p>“I haven’t had the chance to study recent history since my revival, my dear. There’s a possibility the Yashura branched out in the past and made themselves rooted in different places, but it’s not our concern for now,” Mama Ross waved her hand gently. “Go try use your magic item to identify the mystery behind this Formation, Merly my dear. Leaning one or two about ancient spell is very beneficial for your current progress.”</p>\n<p>Ever since she made the contract with Mama Ross, Merly never once hesitated doing whatever the lady Nalaq asked her to do. This time was no different. The Yurin girl immediately took out a wristband from her <b>Mystic Bag</b>, the kind that glow eerie light upon injected with little bit of mana. The wristband was a magic item, specialized in casting support skills related to Specialist Class, of which usually used to gather information from object or person by reading the subtle data from their flow of mana.</p>\n<p>Just when Merly began activating the wristband…</p>\n<p>“This Young Lady Yurin, the statue you want to play with is too dirty. It’s too humble for young lady to play with. Please allow this old servant clean it for you first.”</p>\n<p>Not only Merly, even Mama Ross was started by the sudden voice intruding from behind. They whirled their body around, found an old butler smiled a serene smile. It was Yulong.</p>\n<p>Startled a few steps back both at the same time, Mama Ross and Merly had their tongue tied as they watched Yulong approached the old lion statue. The pair couldn’t take their eyes off from the old butler, and they couldn’t say anything either.</p>\n<p>The lady Nalaq was indignant knowing someone dared to sneakily hid behind them. There was no way an experienced Mage like Mama Ross, although long ceased to live, to be unaware someone standing behind unless the other party intentionally suppressed their presence--Mama Ross would suffer a thousand deaths if she was that sloppy back in her time. Haplessly, they witnessed without protest as Yulong, still keeping his professional butler poise, unhurriedly brushed the moss off from the statue’s surface.</p>\n<p>Knowing that the guest awkwardly stared at him, Yulong turned toward the dumbfounded Merly and said politely, “It might take a while to clean this statue, Young Lady Yurin. Perhaps, the flower garden in the west wing suits you best rather than this old uncared place. You should be more careful next time when visiting unknown places.”</p>\n<p>Now it was Merly’s turn to get angry at the kind-looking old butler. Mama Ross too harrumphed as if she knew Yulong could see her despite not making herself visible to ordinary eyes. Though his words were polite, it was clear he intended to get rid of them. Mama Ross told Merly to go back and not making trouble in front this seemingly powerless butler who didn’t have any level and class.</p>\n<p>“That butler is trouble,” Mama Ross whispered when they already far away. “I can’t see any mana inside him. Any living being should have at least trace of mana, even if they never use it their entire life.”</p>\n<p>As if she understood Mama Ross’s worry, Merly’s mind searching back of the stories she heard from her cousin Jerrin, stories about criminals and psychopaths who spent a great deal of effort and resources to hide their real power and mana so that they could blend amongst the peer of commonfolks. When the first time that butler greeted them at the Yashura Family’s gate, Mama Ross told Merly to be vigilant of him--now she knew why.</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro Yashura and his daughter Mila were accompanying the male guests on the courtyard, chatting while standing in circle with hands holding glasses of <em>tuak</em>. Even though they were embarrassing themselves during the talks before, one shouldn’t underestimated how thick the pair father and daughter’s faces were--they laughed and joked carefreely as if nothing had happened.</p>\n<p>Merly and Mama Ross came back, and they wanted Jerrin and Norman to join them stroll the spacious Yashura Family’s place. Both the men who were called understood that something had happened from seeing the concerned look on Merly’s face.</p>\n<p>“Strange? The old butler?” Jerrin rubbed his chin hearing Merly’s concern--Mama Ross, who hadn’t come out from her body to preserve mana, let the girl did the talking after they pulled Jerrin and Norman to a safe place away from prying eyes. Jerrin then hummed again as he thought of something, saying, “A butler who looks like coming from a noble family but working here instead already strange. And from the name the butler doesn’t sound like coming from the west, either.”</p>\n<p>“No, not that kind of strange,” Merly shook her head. “Mama Ross feels no presence of mana coming out from that butler.”</p>\n<p>“What?” Jerrin knitted his brows, he worked on Blue Robe Society’s External Relations Department for two years and had been aware ugly cases where bad people hid their real power and covered their identity, “is he hiding from someone or something?”</p>\n<p>Norman witnessed Merly’s strange behaviour back when Yulong greeted them at the gate. For the lady Nalaq to be vigilant against the harmless-looking old butler was already within expectations. “Young Lady Merly, is there anything this servant can help you with?”</p>\n<p>“Mama Ross said uncovering the background of the butler named Yulong and Shira Yashura’s father, Jhuro Yashura, is a priority for us to make a decision regarding Yashura Family,” Merly slowly said, then she delivered the words Mama Ross said within her mind to the coachman, “Norman, how much do you know about these two people?”</p>\n<p>“If this about Sir Jhuro Yashura, I happen to know a bit and heard some rumors, I can write another report about him in detail,” Norman took a beat, seemed to be hesitating, “but for the old butler… apart from the fact he hails from Young Master Shira’s mother’s entourage fifteen years ago, there’s no other peculiar information about him.”</p>\n<p>Butler Yulong’s record was clean and straight, always keeping his job in order and never made mistakes. Apparently, Patriarch Shuro liked him greatly, giving him many responsibilities of the inner Yashura Family matters even though the Mossack people hadn’t had any experiences hiring webstern-style butlers.</p>\n<p>“Mm.” Merly hummed, closing her eyes. Jerrin and Norman waited for her as they knew the girl was communicating with the lady Nalaq inside her body. A moment later, she opened her eyes, declaring Mama Ross’s intention as if she was a revered envoy, “Norman, you uncover Butler Yulong’s past before we leave the village.”</p>\n<p>“Understood, Young Lady Merly.”</p>\n<p>Investigating a person with a clean background wasn't an easy thing to do. However, since Mama Ross gave the order herself, then Norman had no choice other than succeeding. His real masters were Merly’s and Jerrin’s fathers, thus he’d do anything in his reach so that the two little masters of his kept receiving the lady Nalaq’s favor.</p>\n<p>“Merly, do we need to consult this with Teacher Barront?” Jerrin asked.</p>\n<p>Merly shook her head. For this matter, she didn’t need to ask Mama Ross, since the Nalaq already said before pulling Jerrin and Norman that they needed someone to entertain the host. It was no good for the guests to minding their own business if the host being polite with them. After all, the Yurins might need to befriend this Yashura Family if the investigations turned out to be good.</p>\n<p>“Teacher Barront is the one who can humor Patriarch Yashura. So we don’t need to bother him. Let’s just focus on the butler and the kid’s father,” Merly said. She had made herself comfortable with calling the shot since the others respected Mama Ross inside of her. After that Merly told both the men what Mama Ross and her discovered in Yashura Family’s old garden. Jerrin Yurin’s eyes shone upon hearing the mysterious ancient Formation and the prospect of old Formation genius’s legacy.</p>\n<p>Even though they didn’t get the third disciple Sir Baront wanted, Jerrin and Merly haste journeyed to Badril Village wasn’t a wasted matter indeed.</p>\n<p>They walked back to regroup with their teacher. As soon as they saw the Patriarch Shuro and his daughter Mila, Jerrin with a big smile congratulating the other party, “Patriarch Yashura, I heard your family is a hidden master in the art of Formation. Why don’t we discuss about it sometimes?”</p>\n<p>“Haha! What hidden master, Young Master Jerrin, you’re overestimating us common village folks!” Patriarch Shuro humbly dismissed the remark with a hearty laugh. He then coughed, leaning to his daughter Mila and whispered, “Girl, what’s this <em>Formation</em> thingy he’s talking about?”</p>\n<p>“The fuck would I know?!” Mila whispered back impatiently. “Am I looked like a geek like that kid Shira?”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro pretended he didn’t hear what Mila said and continued laughing. He said to Jerrin, “Young Master Jerrin, you just need to find my nephew Shira if you have something complicated to discuss, he’s the smartest of us villagers!”</p>\n<p>Shira was the only one in Yashura Family who actually read books. The simple-minded pair father and daughter threw the hot ball to him whenever this kind of problem arose. Jerrin and others good-naturedly nodded even though the sneaky whispers didn’t escaped their ears. The pair’s face indeed as thick as Yashura Family’s legendary sturdy wall.</p>\n<p>Speaking of Shira, he came back after he said he was going to bring the rogue Nalaq with him. He returned alone.</p>\n<p>“Shira my boy, what’s taking you so long?” Patriarch Shuro asked.</p>\n<p>Shira replied, “The Nalaq asked for red roses, and he wanted to meet Esteemed Madame Ross in a secluded shed, so I needed a few while preparing those.”</p>\n<p>“What for?”</p>\n<p>Shira shrugged. “Don’t know. Didn’t ask.” More accurately, he didn’t <em>want to</em> ask.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t matter,” Merly butted in. “Against a low-leveled rogue Nalaqs, a warning from Mama Ross is suffice to make them run between their tails. It doesn’t matter if they’re preparing a trap or not.”</p>\n<p>So the other party thought Good-Natured Spirit was setting a trap. That’s good, it was better for Shira if they misunderstood--that way, he didn’t need to explain the matter about the shady candle-lit room, out-of-place bed of roses, and a certain Good-For-Nothing Spirit playing guitar.</p>\n<p>Merly then ordered Shira to lead her to the shed where the two Nalaqs supposed to meet. The boy sighed, didn’t know whether the girl or the Nalaq inside her the one who was rude to him this time. But it didn’t matter, in the end, even that cocky Good-Natured Spirit didn’t worth a penny on the esteemed guests’ eyes. He felt bad thinking Good-Natured Spirit would get rejected and would get rid off. He still felt bad about his primary source of income that would soon disappear.</p>\n<p>Shira sighed again.</p>\n<p>“Stop sighing,” Merly barked as she followed behind the boy.</p>\n<p>Shira turned his head and smiled wryly, he didn’t say anything. The girl didn’t have anyone to accompany her, except for him and the lady Nalaq inside her. He began to think if these people really did underestimated Good-Natured Spirit.</p>\n<p>“Shouldn’t we brought more people?” he asked cautinously.</p>\n<p>“Mama Ross already scared enough low-leveled Nalaqs she an expert on it. Let’s not waste anyone’s time,” Merly said, knitting her brows.</p>\n<p>This was the girl he talking with, not the Nalaq, Shira realized. But he didn’t understand why she got angry with such little thing. Shira just shrugged it and thought the girl didn’t like him from the start. Thus he didn’t say any unnecessary words. They were already close to the secluded shed anyway.</p>\n<p>“That is the place where the Nalaq is waiting,” Shira said as he pointed out a nice little shed that seemingly ordinary. Then he coughed, saying, “Be careful… he might prepare something… unexpected.”</p>\n<p>Mama Ross came out from Merly’s body. Looking at the awkward Shira, she waved her hand, saying, “Thank you for your concern, child. A Nalaq’s threat might scare you since you’ve been living all your life in a small village like this. However, I’m already getting used to a life in the great war; setting a little trap is futile against me.”</p>\n<p>With his eyes blinking, Shira clasped his wrist, tried very hard to look innocent and pretending to know nothing about the near future trouble that he worried might happen. When Mama Ross realized the weird expression on the boy’s face, she waved her hand dismissively.</p>\n<p>“Nothing will happen. If that rogue Nalaq is smart, he’d be obedient move away after we talk like two civilized Nalaqs,” Mama Ross said confidently.</p>\n<p>Shira nodded with a smile that became even more wry than the smile he had previously. Mama Ross and Merly already said their pieces, naturally they wouldn’t want to waste time convincing a boy they only knew less than a day that everything would be alright.</p>\n<p>“Merly, wait here with this Yashura child. Giving a warning to this rogue Nalaq should take around five minutes, I’ll be quick,” Mama Ross said as she ruffled Merly’s hair.</p>\n<p>“Yes, Mama Ross.”</p>\n<p>Then Mama Ross floated away toward the secluded shed’s direction. Soon, her transparent figure seeped into the wooden plank door. Nobody except her and Good-Natured Spirit was inside.</p>\n<p><em>JREEENGG!!!</em></p>\n<p>A crisp noise of a guitar being strummed from inside was heard immediately after Mama Ross entered. It transitioned seamlessly into an energizing, unapologetic Spanish guitar melody.</p>\n<p><em>Jreng jeeng jreng jeng jreeng...</em></p>\n<p>No angry arguments could be heard from inside, quiet except for Good-Natured Spirit trying to hit on Mama Ross with his corny romantic guitar melody. It was peaceful unlike what Shira worried beforehand. However, just when Shira about to pat his chest in relief, the shed suddenly exploded.</p>\n<p><em>BBOOOOOOOMMMM!!!</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>It wasn’t that long since a loud explosion came from Yashura Family, the explosion made the village shook yet again. The Village Head, who was in Elzhier Family doing trivial daily paper job, turned his head at the source of explosion.</p>\n<p>“Again? What happened in Yashura Family?!”</p>\n<p>Even in Malikh Family, the forever carefree Lyla Blackwood who previously was busy coaxing the proud bunny with carrots, swiftly sprang back to Bhela, shocked by the sudden explosion.</p>\n<p>“What was that Sistah?! What was that!!!” Lyla cried as she leaped into Bhela’s embrace.</p>\n<p>Bhela’s face was solemn as she tried to guess what had happened. Then, looking at Lyla’s scaredy eyes, she said slowly, “Someone who made contract with evil is being punished by karma. You should remember this to not following their foolish step, Lyla.”</p>\n<p>Lyla, who had her mind half-occupied with the now fleeing bunny, nodded her head even though she didn’t fully understand. Bhela brought the noble girl indoor as to not minding about the explosion that had nothing to do with Malikh Family.</p>\n<p>Back to Yashura Family, the secluded meeting place where now bushes and trees being swallowed by raging flames. Choked in thick flying dust, Shira lifted his head from kissing dirt. Near him, Merly Yurrin stared at the burning shed dazedly with a glint of righteous fury seen on her eyes.</p>\n<p>Shira followed the girl’s gaze toward the source of the madness, yet could see nothing but raging fire. In the center of it, Good-Natured Spirit’s voice could be heard: “Whoa, whoa there, big boobs lady, let’s try to talk this out in civilized manner, okay…”</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the licking flames that arose with the tall of adult males began to get sucked in single direction, unfolding the two ethereal silhouettes in the midst of it all: a suave, hairy chest revealing Good-Natured Spirit hugging a guitar with a stalk of red rose he bit between his teeth, and a fireball channeling Mama Ross, who was very mad and now busy trying to kill him.</p>\n<p><em>BOOOOMMM!!!</em></p>\n<p>The fireball exploded even more shocking than the one from before. When Shira lifted his head again this time, not only the shed ruined by the swallowing fire, the thick, sturdy wall that had been the pride of Yashura Family for a hundred years, that been said could defend against one thousand type of monsters, had its most sturdy part blasted by the blind fireball Mama Ross thrown.</p>\n<p>Shira couldn’t help but to suck a deep breath. It only could described madness happening all around him. The most shocking of all of this was, even though Mama Ross attacked him with tremendous destructive power, Good-Natured Spirit dodgedly disappeared for a brief moment then suddenly popped out beside the tongue-tied Mama Ross, unschated.</p>\n<p>“Now, now, beautiful lady, being fierce is okay, but too much of it you’ll ruin your beauty. Let’s calm down and talk about peace and love, okay?” his husky whisper rang beside Mama Ross’s ear, while sneakily, his hand had been groping her butt.</p>\n<p>Mama Ross’s pupil shrank. She had long been dead, and had long forgotten how fast and deadly the guy’s move could be.</p>\n<p>“Hufff!” exploding the mana she reserved these past three years, Mama Ross engulfed her spiritual being with living flame, she immediately broke free from Good-Natured Spirit’s blatant sexual assault, and while doing so, made a whip with her fire elemental mana and flashed it onto Good-Natured Spirit’s face.</p>\n<p>Hissing, Good-Natured Spirit remarked, “Fierce!”</p>\n<p>The woman who used to be one of the pillars that supervised Tiramikal Continent was by no means weak. Even when she revived as a Nalaq, and she could only manifest one-fourth of her past power with the help of the contract she made with Merly Yurin, the whip she created with the intent of blasting the shameless rogue Nalaq’s face only leave a shallow whipping mark. Good-Natured Spirit even smirked as he rubbed his whipped face.</p>\n<p>The fury in her eyes shimmered no longer; it burst out along with her abundance enmity. The magical flame that gulfing her body began to seep inside, coloring her entire ethereal body with the color of fiery ember.</p>\n<p>“Mama Ross!” Merly cried, trying to call her name and make her return to her normal calm Mama Ross. The inexperienced Merly was at loss; the position of the contractor of Mama Ross made it known that the lady Nalaq was planning to burn herself along with the evil, vulgar Nalaq with the guitar.</p>\n<p>“What to do? I just touch you a little, beautiful big boobs lady, no need to get serious!” Even Good-Natured Spirit couldn’t help but complain to seek justice--which very much he didn’t deserve.</p>\n<p>The flaming Mama Ross arose into the air. Like a rising sun she shone her fire elemental affinity mana like the ancient idol in stories.</p>\n<p>Shira was thunderstruck. It seemed Mama Ross was going to release an awesome fire skill that would blast Good-For-Nothing Spirit for good. However… did the mad lady Nalaq considered Merly and him also was inside her firing range?</p>\n<p>Not far from where Shira was crouching from danger, he saw Merly kneeling with her head lowered, expression serene, seemingly to beg for miracle yet accepting whatever calamity that would descend upon her at the same time.</p>\n<p>“Fool!” although Shira didn’t like the girl, as a pure Mossack descendant as he was, he absolutely wouldn’t let the most taboo event befall his Yashura Family; a Mossack, even if it would kill him, wouldn’t let a guest die in his own yard lest a terrible luck would descend upon his bloodline in the future generations.</p>\n<p>Therefore, moving his untalented body as a Novice, Shira sprang from his hiding position, grabbing the Young Lady Yurin by the hip, and started to escape to a cover.</p>\n<p>“Release me, you little swine!” Merly screamed, “I need to channel my mana for Mama Ross!”</p>\n<p>So the reason for the lady Nalaq could cast a spell this powerful was because this girl provided her with raw mana. Shira’s expression darkened. Although he had the slightest virtue of ancient Mossack to respect and protect one’s guests, he wasn’t a fool himself who would be washing his own neck while the other person sharpening their executing blade.</p>\n<p>Shira had decided. They said human channeled mana through breathing technique as their basic function to connect their manasphere inside toward the ever empowering law of System outside. Thus, for this situation, Shira simply pinched Merly’s neck and covered her mouth as to not let her breathing properly.</p>\n<p>“Sffhwine! Shhffwiiine!”</p>\n<p>Indeed that worked. Mama Ross felt the mana being supplied to her halted, and abruptly her sharp gaze moved to the restrained Merly.</p>\n<p>“Release Merly immediately!”</p>\n<p>Shira staggered, the fiery aura Mama Ross radiated intimidate him. But with Yashura Family’s safety behind him, he forced himself to hold his ground.</p>\n<p>“You’re going to destroy Yashura Family, Esteemed Lady Nalaq, please quell your anger!” Shira begged.</p>\n<p>“Impudent! Who told you to talk back to me! Release her!”</p>\n<p>Shira’s sucked a deep breath. He just did what he did because he thought that Mama Ross lost her mind in a momentary lapse of reason, all due to Good-Natured Spirit’s assault. Yet the more he saw, the clearer it was to him that he was wrong. The lady Nalaq had her mind in order, and the anger and the killing intent directed toward the boy were real.</p>\n<p>For a split second Shira glanced at Good-Natured Spirit, the one who started it all, but it was useless. The bastard was mesmerized in the awe of Mama Ross’s curves, wasn’t clear whether he realized--or even cared--about the impending doom that would soon befall them.</p>\n<p>“Good-Natured Bastard!” the boy yelled.</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit glanced at him for a second, shrugging, then swept back his eyes to enjoy the scenery. The enraged Mama Ross had her ethereal clothes became more transparent, so Good-Natured Spirit couldn’t be bothered.</p>\n<p>Seeing that talking to both the Nalaqs was useless, Shira then whispered beside Merly’s ear. “Please do me a favor. Lady Nalaq can burn the bastard all she wants, just not here in Yashura Family.”</p>\n<p>There was no response coming from Merly. All Shira could hear was her heavy breathing, breathing through her mouth, the breath that escaping from between his fingers.</p>\n<p>“Please, talk to Lady Nalaq,” Shira said again, begging.</p>\n<p>Merly was stiff like a statue. Shira had no choice but to release her, since he had no more reliable options. Yet although he didn’t have too much hope relying on the girl, never did he expected that Merly would turn on him, with her eyes drown in fury, pointing her finger with surefire judgement.</p>\n<p>“Swine! How dare you touching me! Who do you think you are?!” Merly’s scream squealing sharply. Turning to Mama Ross, she complained, “Mama Ross, please give me a justice!”</p>\n<p>“Good!” the flaming Mama Ross curtly exclaimed, “no wonder such a hateful Nalaq found himself a home here. Turns out they’re both wearing the same disgusting wolf skin, good!”</p>\n<p>Shira’s eyes turned cold. It didn’t need a brain for him to realize the lady Nalaq intended to burn the defenseless him before she dealt with Good-Natured Spirit.</p>\n<p>Merly began to recharge mana again for Mama Ross. Shira felt they didn’t even hesitate this time.</p>\n<p>Yet, in spite of him standing in a dangerous situation, Shira didn’t bulge. He just stared at them coldly, didn’t even try to defend himself.</p>\n<p>“You’re a guest of Yashura Family, are you sure you want to harm your host?” the boy warned icily.</p>\n<p>Mama Ross scoffed. She began to conjure a fireball, not too big, but enough to burn the cocky boy to half-death state.</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit, who was interrupted, “Ah, big boobs lady, I know that little shit is kinda annoying, but I wouldn’t throw that dangerous fireball at him if I were you.”</p>\n<p>“Shut up! You’re the next one who’s gonna die, Gyl!”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit laughed. Sure enough, this lady Nalaq was a bimbo. He, the Nalaq who had been here for around a year, would plan it through step by step before even he pluck a strand of the boy’s hair. “Harming someone behind Yashura Family’s wall is hefta complicated matter than you’d think,” he said.</p>\n<p>Though he wasn’t going to admit it, Good-Natured Spirit look forward to seeing the cocky boy who always rob his wallet after games of chess going to piss himself. It wasn’t happening, to his disappointment, the boy proved to have nerves of steel in the face of growing deadly fireball--that, or was in dire need of getting his brain diagnosed.</p>\n<p>Was the little moron knew the fireball from a high-leveled Nalaq could do more than melt his face?</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit sighed. Thinking about it again, this Yashura young master brat would really dying wasn’t going to happen. He curious who was going to step forward to diffuse the situation, anyway.</p>\n<p>The only thing he regretted that the bimbo’s melons this time actually the real deal. Unfortunately, the first thing she did after coming to this village was to poke on the hornet nest. Though he, as the good-natured gentleman he was, wanted to save a bimbo in the imminent distress--definitely not when he wasn’t sure whether the bimbo would throw fireball at his face again after he saved her like a handsome, suave knight as he actually was.</p>\n<p><em>SWUOOOOSSSHH!!</em></p>\n<p>Before even Mama Ross could throw her fireball, four pouncing metal snakes sprang from her blind spots, coiling around her transparent body.</p>\n<p>The one who diffuse the situation as Good-Natured Spirit predicted really did stepping forward.</p>\n<p>Four masked silhouette leaped out of their hiding place, pushing the stunned Mama Ross’s face onto the ground. All happened too fast. Merly, in midst of freaking out, only to return at reality at the scene of Mama Ross being reprimanded in chains by four masked women in black--and very tight--clad. Only two seconds passed, Merly herself got pushed down by from behind.</p>\n<p>Shira, with his eyes alert, glanced back to prepare being reprimanded like Mama Ross and Merly. Yet the masked women didn’t bother with him. The boy wasn’t sure whether this mysterious group lacked personals or simply didn’t see him as a threat. He wasn’t expecting them at all.</p>\n<p>On the contrary, the only one who expected these mysterious women in tight suits’ arrival was Good-Natured Spirit; he was happy to see those voluptuous curves again. Some of them had even bigger melons than Mama Ross.</p>\n<p>This made Shira tightening his brows. Weren’t these women from the hidden Big-Boobs Sect Good-Natured Spirit mentioned once?</p>\n<p>As they said, seeing is believing. Seeing that Good-Natured Spirit was smug and happy there was no reason for Shira to not believing him now.</p>\n<p>“Release me! We did our stand against their sexual assault! Release Mama Ross!” Merly screamed. Even then, the masked women didn’t budge. They kept pinning the them down the ground.</p>\n<p>Only after Shira watched the girl futilely cried her injustice he did notice the masked women didn’t come here to antagonize Yashura Family. He would be at the disadvantages otherwise, since the other party didn’t seem to be uninformed Badril Village dwellers who were ignorant of the southerner rules. Shira wasn’t afraid of Mama Ross and the faraway Yurin Family since they were outsiders; however, if the women were sent by someone who rooted in Badril Village, it’d be quite a different story.</p>\n<p><em>Splaash!</em></p>\n<p>The sound of splashing water came as surprising as thunderous strike. Just when the esteemed Nalaq Mama Ross being pushed down pitifully and Merly had to spit dirts than accidentally entered her mouth as her cheek forced kissing the ground, the old butler, Yulong, unconcernedly ran toward the fire with a bucket of water.</p>\n<p>“Yulong!” Shira ran toward the butler, and urgently whispered, “go tell my uncle, anonymous members of a hidden sect came into our walls!”</p>\n<p>Yulong, gazing at his young master blankly, asked, “What hidden sect, young master? I don’t know what you are talking about.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t you see how they pin down Madame Nalaq?” Shira hissed.</p>\n<p>Yulong followed the direction Shira signaled with his eyes. The masked women awkwardly waiting for the old butler took his eyes off them. A moment later, the butler’s eyes came back to the boy again. His wrinkled face smiled with worry. “Young Master Shira, I don’t see anyone there.”</p>\n<p>“Yulong, you’re joking,” Shira said wryly. Yulong always a solemn man and never did Shira saw him made a joke--especially not in this kind of situation. “They burned down the damned place, Yulong. All started because Madame Ross confront that guy!”</p>\n<p>“What guy?” Yulong again followed the direction Shira signalled, but now with a pair of alertful eyes. The Nalaq with a guitar brazenly returned back the butler’s gaze, he scoffed. Yulong’s gaze turned cold.</p>\n<p>But then Yulong said to Shira again, “I don’t see anything, Young Master.”</p>\n<p>“Yulong…”</p>\n<p>“Young master, I really don’t see anything,” Yulong said with an assuring smile. “Even if I did, do you think some people have that kind of nerve to do that kind of brazen thing inside of Yashura Family walls? What if…”--his eyes tracked on the masked women, the pinned Nalaq, and the screaming girl--, “what if Yashura Family relatives leave their works outside and run back here because some misunderstanding?”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit laughed at the blatant indirect threat. The eyes of the masked women flickered, exchanged glances at each other, and quickly came to a decision; they must leave this place immediately.</p>\n<p>The masked women disappeared like a wind blowing puffs of smoke, bringing the crying and screaming Merly and Mama Ross whose eyes seemed to be lost. All of the sudden, the burning place turned quiet.</p>\n<p>“See, there’s nothing there,” Yulong nodded as if he was satisfied with something.</p>\n<p>Now that the beautiful lasses already gone, Good-Natured Spirit laughed sarcastically at the old butler as he playfully played his guitar. “I didn’t see anything, I didn’t do anything.” And with that, he flew away like nothing had happened.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, a panic stricken crowd came trotting urgently with buckets of water on their hands. Leading them was Patriarch Shuro, who upon seeing the large fire and the hole in the family’s wall with his own eyes, had almost fainted on the spot. It was fortunate Mila was there with a few of idle young wives she knew, who most of them knew had an affinity with water elemental and could provide some help in extinguishing the fire.</p>\n<p>“Shira, what’s happened here?!” Mila asked with shrill voice.</p>\n<p>Before Shira could decide whether to tell the truth or not, Butler Yulong came forward and begged for forgiveness. “Apologize, Young Lady Mila, this servant burned some trash here and unwittingly set ablaze the whole place. It’s all my fault.” he admit regretfully. After lifting his head from bowing in front of Mila, Yulong looked at the blinking Shira, then smiled at the two cousins. “Thankfully, those trashes already gone. So I guarantee no accidents will happen in the future.”</p>\n<p>Since Yulong already plead guilty from the whole matter, naturally Mila let it go and focused on helping the crowd stopping the fire before it spread somewhere else. Nobody there except Shira had a second thought on Yulong’s confession.</p>\n<p>Shira glanced at the butler, the old man who he’d known far back since he was in milking years. He still hesitating. Not to mention the rampaging Mama Ross and the Big-Boobs Sect--as Good-Natured Spirit called them--actually did exist, Shira really didn’t expect Yulong, the one who supposed more solemn and strict than an ox, could actually tell lies with such a straight face. He was shocked by the revelation.</p>\n<p>Eventually, an hour was needed to extinguish the fire. Yashura Family then fought the disaster with grit and grievance. It was considered slow since they had a few spare water affinity Mage with them. This partly because never did anyone expected that the more serious explosion happening, but more because they had been worried the whole time about a matter that none of them could answer.</p>\n<p>“Patriarch Shuro Yashura,” Baront Staterwind came in with solemn atmosphere, the trace of his previous politeness wasn’t there anymore, “my disciple Merly Yurrin and Esteemed Madame Ross wandered around in Yashura Family. But still till now, we can’t find here, their aura we’re supposed able to track also vanish without a trace.”</p>\n<p>The whole line of Patriarch Shuro’s family were nervous. Someone even gulped because the tense mood.</p>\n<p>“We’re coming with friendly intention, Patriarch Yashura, we’re just want to find them right now. So if you know something, please do tell us. Consider this I’m indebted to your Yashura Family.”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro nodded gravely. Then he turned his head to Mila his daughter.</p>\n<p>“Mm.” Mila Yashura nodded solemnly. Then she turned her head to Shira her cousin.</p>\n<p>Shira wanted to turn his head but Yulong, the one who most suspicious, wasn’t here with them. So he had to answer seriously, “I don’t know. I don’t see anything.”</p>\n<p>Baront Staterwind’s and Jerrin Yurrin’s faces fell. Eventually, Yashura Family could only offer an apology and ambiguously promised to find Merly and the lady Nalaq. Sir Baront Staterwind wasn’t happy, but there was nothing he could do since Yashura Family the one who suffered the greatest lost at the end of the day.</p>\n<p>Sometime later, Yulong the old butler was seen oversaw the servants to clean up the mess. Though Patriarch Shuro Yashura said he’d punish Yulong over the incident, the fact he still able to command over the servants like the usual, was akin to telling the outsiders that Yashura Family wouldn’t pursue this matter in spite of the heavy loss they’d received. There were mixed opinions regarding family’s policy toward the old butler this time.</p>\n<p>“Yulong,” Shira stepped in to approach the old butler who was managing the workers cleaning the ruin, “can I talk with you a second?”</p>\n<p>“What is it that young master needs from this old butler?” Yulong inquired with the usual polite smile of his.</p>\n<p>Ensuring that no one else heard what he was going to say, Shira leaned in to whisper, “Don’t hide it from me any longer, Yulong. Tell me what kind of sect hidden in Elzhier Family.”</p>\n<p>Yulong looked at him puzzledly. “Why do you think Elzhier Family is hiding anything?”</p>\n<p>“The only family who’s in contact with foreign sect in the last ten years is Elzhier Family,” Shira said unhesitantly. “I’ve heard the Ryntia Elzhier was sending lots of trivial letters from overseas. People thought her not sending good stuff from outside means she lost favor from the sect that recruited her, but I don’t think a young woman from a no-name village would be able to live casually in foreign land if they lose the only foothold they have.”</p>\n<p>Yulong smiled. “And why do you think they would be hiding only from the last ten years, young master?”</p>\n<p>Shira didn’t expect Yulong would make things harder for him. He was already missing the old Yulong who always nice to him.</p>\n<p>“I’m pretty sure the expert who recruited Elzhier Family’s eldest young lady came from the same pack with the women that brought Merly and the lady Nalaq away.”</p>\n<p>“Yes. But how can you be so sure?”</p>\n<p>Shira frowned.</p>\n<p>“Yulong, who’s your real master really, now?” he said carefully, naturally didn’t want to admit his ridiculous guess was based on the famous rumors of the said expert had her chest a bit too big than average beauties--something that he immediately linked to the nickname Good-Natured Spirit gave to their sect.</p>\n<p>“Apologize if this old man offends you, young master,” Yulong said with an unhurried tone. “But due to my old duty for Sir Jhuro, I’ll have to make sure you prepare before you explore the uncharted side of Badril Village. But then again,” Yulong put his arms on his back and continued, “if you want to know some trivial matters, I guess I can help as long as you tell me what your current objective is.”</p>\n<p>“I just want to fetch them back to Sir Baront and his party,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>Yulong seemed to gather his thought for a second, with his pair of eyes that hadn’t had showing any sign of weariness due to old age landed on the boy’s face. The Young Master of Yashura Family was fifteen years old this year. One more year until his official age of ceremony. But seeing the determined young face staring back at him, in the end, Yulong could only concede and sighed deeply.</p>\n<p>“I see, you are indeed have matured too soon, young master. There’s nothing I could do to stop you if you’re this stubborn,” Yulong said while his head nodded lightly. Then he proceed to tell Shira some matters that unknown to common people. “Although the only family in Badril Village that has adopted matriarchy system in the past, in reality, the family where women actually have the most political power is Elzhier Family. It just they don’t show their fangs in the daylight. And they spread their influence and mingle with the common folks. So you won’t be able to contact them if you go through their main door. Go ask them for Elder Shyla, young master. She handles their external matters and works in the open, so she’s the most highest ranking out of them you can meet right now. And if anyone stops you--” Yulong plucked a pin of roaring lion he had on his butler uniform--it was the popular emblem of roaring Yashura Family, “shows them that you represent Yashura Family to fetch the guests they’ve taken.”</p>\n<p>Shira received the pin from Yulong; there wasn’t anything different with the usual family’s emblem, from what he studied. And the matter Yulong gave him the pin meant that, for whatever reasons, he wouldn’t get involved beyond this. As the one who felt the most responsible over the incident, Shira didn’t plan to rely on too much from him again, anyway.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Elder Shyla was born in Badril Village, had long found a successful career as a career woman in Elzhier Family’s domestic politics. And the unusual big luggages on her chest--if following the thinking of Good-For-Nothing Spirit--would also reinforced the idea of this hidden sect was already being around in Badril Village for decades.</p>\n<p>Shira couldn’t help but shook at the idea of hidden power controlling those usually smug Elzhiers from the shadow. It was no wonder Elzhier Family could easily retain their connections and had the more assets and material wealth than what Yashura and Malikh owned combined.</p>\n<p>Walking toward the Elzhier Family’s pace in the west of Badril Village, the boy couldn’t help but concerned; any elders would be fine, but not Elder Shyla. The reason for this was because she was an unmarried woman, and not just an ordinary unmarried woman--if the recent Bhela Malikh wasn’t so adored for her beauty and talent, any man in Badril Village would say Elder Shyla was their goddess. The most beautiful and elegant woman in Badril Village, no other aunties could even compare. This made Shira worried if he approached her the wrong way, might lead to some headache he wouldn’t expect like what Bhela Malikh gave him already.</p>\n<p>“Oh, isn’t this Yashura brat?” a rather unpleasant laugh could be heard from behind.</p>\n<p>Shira turned his head. The trio privileged young thugs, as they called them, Bony and his two friends Pilek and Polio, just returned from the river with a few of freshly caught carp in their hands. The one who was laughing was that Pilek who always wore an idiotic grin on his face.</p>\n<p>“I heard your girl ditching you for a rich boy, Young Master Shira,” he said with his grin, approaching Shira. “Don’t be too sad. Bhela that girl might not be the best for you, but hey, there are still many fish out there. Like here, you can marry this carp for life.”</p>\n<p>Shira declined the fish Pilek jokingly offered. Seeing there was Bony there, Shira decided not to take Pilek’s joke seriously. “No thanks, I think you need it more since no girls ever accepted your confession.”</p>\n<p>“You--” Pilek didn’t know what to say. His romance story indeed more pitiful than everyone else his age.</p>\n<p>“You’re going to Elzhier Family?” Bony who stayed silent then asked Shira.</p>\n<p>“Yashura Family is quite unlucky today,” Shira replied with a nod. Then he said ambiguously, “Someone got entangled in today’s accident and direly in need for something. We’ve heard Elder Shyla has this particular something and I’m willing to trade something for that something.”</p>\n<p>Bony frowned, “What is it that you needed?”</p>\n<p>“I want to engage in private trade with Elder Shyla,” Shira also frowned, “you’re also someone who would inherit a major family, Young Master Bonithon, I expect you to know that I’m in a pinch to not leaking sensitive matters.”</p>\n<p>“Exactly because you’re going to inherit a major family, it’s best for you not to meet Elder Shyla in private,” Bony said. “She’s an unmarried woman. It’s one year until your coming of age ceremony. And add that to the mess with Malikh Family recently. If people say you’re too bitter and want to run away for another, people will talk. You’re yourself should’ve realized how they talked a lot of shit about you.”</p>\n<p>Until two years ago, Bony and his two friends had always been the first one to pick on him. Shira didn’t know why, he just reckoned they had something against him. There was a hint of impatient on Bony’s tone as he explaining matters to him.</p>\n<p>Shira sighed inside. It seemed to him that asking help from these punks was only a pipe dream. If only Mila was here, things would get easier, since that angry tomboy might be the only one who could deal with Bony. The tales from two years ago, tales of her punching Bony’s face and made his pointy nose bled still a legend amongst the youngsters.</p>\n<p>Bony didn’t even budge when Shira showed him the pin Yulong gave him. Not surprisingly, he didn’t get anything from Bony eventually. Shira began to think to get inside Elzhier Family through bribing some guards and maidservants was easier than this. Without anymore chit-chat he along with Pilek and Polio then strode away with a bunch of fish they caught, discussing merely how they’d cook the fish and what spice they were going to use.</p>\n<p>And just when Shira about to decide whether to use backdoor instead, someone poked his shoulder from behind.</p>\n<p>“Wha--? You scared me…” Shira smiled upon finding the one who poked him only a girl of ten years old. This girl also had a carp fish on her hand, and from the clothes she wore and the fact she was barefoot, Shira reckoned she was a servant’s daughter that coming along with Bony to help them fishing on the river. “Is there something you need, girl?” he asked awkwardly seeing the clear eyes of the servant girl staring deeply at him.</p>\n<p>“Can I see that pin?” the girl asked.</p>\n<p>Since the roaring lion pin wasn’t that precious looking, Shira agreed immediately. It didn’t seem like the girl would run away as soon as she got the pin on her hands. Instead, she studied the pin with determined face.</p>\n<p>“Can I get that again? There’s something I need to do, girl,” Shira said hurriedly. He didn’t have the time to humor a servant girl he didn’t even know her name.</p>\n<p>Seeing the impatience in Shira’s eyes, the girl returned the pin back to him, plus a free coupon for a shop owned by Elzhier Family. “You should wait at my parents’ shop, Young Master Shira. There are free snacks for you to eat there.”</p>\n<p>“No, like I said, there’s something I’ve got to do.”</p>\n<p>The girl blinked, still her eyes staring at him. Shira got uncomfortable. He didn’t even know why this girl gave him a free snacks coupon out of the sudden.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira,” the girl said flatly, “if you want to fetch Young Lady Yurin and Lady Ross, you should wait at my parents’ shop. Someone soon will bring them to you.”</p>\n<p>Shira was flastergabbed. Before even he could ask something from the girl, she already trotting far away to follow Bony and others. It was later when Shira woke up from his daze that he realized he just talked with a member of the hidden sect.</p>\n<p>The girl, who was only ten years old and barely developed, was undisputedly a member of the so-called Big-Boobs Sect. Shira’s face was grim realizing the whole matter was far more complicated than he thought.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>After the masked women brought her away, Merly felt her head was heavy, felt like they made her inhale something hypnotic. Although her consciousness was a mess, somehow Merly able to retain her ability to measure time, and counting only an hour had passed since the incident in Yashura Family. Her blurry perception relapsed from time to time. She heard someone talking near her, but couldn’t make up sensible conclusion.</p>\n<p>“…I did have my suspicious, but never would’ve thought Elzhier Family is Luna’s Elzhier that I always knew…” that was Mama Ross’s voice. She said more about Elzhier, but Merly couldn’t follow her words after that. But a moment later, Mama Ross’s grave tone nearly woke Merly up. “Who is the lunatic who dared to revive Gyl’s soul?”</p>\n<p>Merly didn’t mistaken, Mama Ross’s tone now filled with grievance, the same grievance that she felt drove Mama Ross into trying to kill that evil, vulgar rogue Nalaq.</p>\n<p>And the one who replied Mama Ross was a woman, whose voice was clear and beautiful, merrily said, “You shouldn’t have asked a humble member of the sect like me a question like that, Lady Ross. Fortunately, Sect Founder coincidentally leave a message for you. She said that since the Liberators chairman gave his permission for you and the other pillars to take Mister Gyl down, certainly he didn’t need for your permission to revive him as a Nalaq.”</p>\n<p>“Ha! Why still call us backstabbing women the Seven Pillars then? It’s nothing but glorify a compromise! Reviving that bastard brings nothing but disaster!”</p>\n<p>Elder Shyla politely disagree. “Mister Gyl has been revived for around one hundred years. And no such disaster like you were talking about has happened. You better leave everything in the past, Lady Ross, as this is what our Sect Founder wishes for you. Sect Founder knew, after all, you are the one amongst the pillar to hold the most grudge against Mister Gyl. But please, Lady Ross, remember that you have Yurin Family under your wing now. And also remember Young Lady Merly Yurin is about to enter Blue Robe Society by next year. You wouldn’t want to put this girl Merly in danger, would you?”</p>\n<p>Mama Ross didn’t answer the woman’s question. Merly, as the contractor of Mama Ross’s soul, felt the echoes of the Nalaq’s fluctuate emotion; it was the same when Mama Ross descended into uncontrollable rage upon seeing the disgusting vulgar smirk of that rogue Nalaq. Only this time, as she inflicted by Mama Ross’s overwhelming sadness, she felt like her heart being sliced by a thousand cuts.</p>\n<p>“Ugghhh…” a soft groan escaped Merly’s lips. She wanted to get up, but even her eyelids felt heavy. Her head felt like shattered into pieces.</p>\n<p>“Oh, you’re awake?” the woman’s voice directed at her. When Merly able to open her eyes wide, slowly the face of a beautiful vixen entered her sight. Her smile wasn’t too excessive, yet, since Mama Ross didn’t like her, naturally Merly thus found this woman quite dislikable.</p>\n<p>It was quite difficult for Merly to see what was going on. She held through, eventually, and found out she was inside a humble room with walls made with logs of <em>cendana</em> woods--a kind of wood that looked ordinary outward but would give a rare comforting scene for the occupants, the type that looked shabby but actually was a high-class materials. Mama Ross was sitting beside her. Two other figures in the room were the vixen who later introduced herself as Elder Shyla of Elzhier Family, along with a maidservant who was grinding herbal roots for the soup that been shimmering in the middle of the room.</p>\n<p>Elder Shyla used a pair of chopsticks to pick braised meat cuts that was sliced in uniformed rectangle, putting them into a bowl garnished with exquisitely sliced vegetables. The silent maidservant then carefully poured the shimmering broth, creating a clear harmonic sound as the warm water splashing onto the antique-looking ceramic bowl.</p>\n<p>Smiling to Merly, Elder Shyla said, “You must feel a bit heavy after inhaling our sect’s calming herbs. Please, Young Lady Yurin, consider this as a gesture of apology from us.”</p>\n<p>Initially, Merly wanted to refuse the other party’s offer. Calling a numbing poison a calming herb was an outrageous understatement. Yet Mama Ross told her to accept it. “Savor the soup, my dear. You’ll never got to eat this kind of meat again.”</p>\n<p>“Sure the meat is rare,” Elder Shyla laughed cheerfully, “even the core disciples of our sect can eat at most three serving each year. We are willing to part with it because we value Lady Ross’s past relationship with our Sect Founder.”</p>\n<p>Merly didn’t know what kind of soup she ate that day. But she’d never forget the look on Mama Ross’s face, who seemed wry with awkwardness, almost telling her that as long as they got this soup as the compensation, then any grievance wouldn’t be too much to bear.</p>\n<p>“Elder Shyla,” a young flat voice of ten years old girl greeted after the door being knocked thrice, “Young Master of Yashura Family came to fetch the guests.”</p>\n<p>“Is it time? Is the Nalaq still around?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, he’s hanging around on the street like the usual,” the young girl replied.</p>\n<p>“Then this isn’t the time yet,” Elder Shyla said.</p>\n<p>Merly just drank the broth till the last drop. Mama Ross told her to savor her bowl of soup clean. When Elder Shyla asked her that question, Merly put down the ceramic bowl and bowing her head in gratitude. “Thank you for the treat.”</p>\n<p>“Drink this tea also, Young Lady Yurin, before you return to your people,” Elder Shyla offered a glass of tea, which Mama Ross also told Merly to drink.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, one particular shop that Elzhier Family owned just lit their torches as the day was about to end. Shira sat alone, peeling a boiled egg he got for free, while his mind doubted the lack of customers since he got here was happening without any hidden interference. Yet everything looked normal. Even the hospitable pair husband and wife that running the shop seemed like they were not people from unordinary origin.</p>\n<p>“I saw your daughter today,” Shira said as he sprinkled salt onto his boiled egg. “Her face looks like she’ll be a great talent in the future. Any thoughts on sending her to school to study? Or sending to a certain sect?”</p>\n<p>There was no one beside him and the pair of parents, so the husband responded his words with a laugh. “Young Master Shira surely jest. Looks like our dearest daughter got praised because a free voucher. In that case, please young master, tell us how you feel after eating this portion of free braised chicken on top of white rice!”</p>\n<p>“Our daughter was lucky to be able to impress the aloof Young Master Yashura. Free voucher indeed is effective. We’re currently in promotion period, young master, please spread the word if you’re satisfied with our plates!” the wife said with a laugh as big as the husband’s. “Here, please drink this free avocado juice to accompany the free meal.”</p>\n<p>Shira smiled dryly. The couple indeed knew how the world worked. He believed that these couple found out he was probing into the sect’s matter, and thus the bribe. They wanted to make Shira shut up with his curious questions.</p>\n<p>As someone who was already experienced in taking dirty money from a certain rogue Nalaq, Shira surely wouldn’t shy away from free benefits. He took the plate and grabbed the spoon. Forcing a bunch of hidden experts to come out was useless anyway. Quietly ate his free meals, Shira believed the other party would come since they already sacrificing braised chicken and avocado juice to make him stay obediently.</p>\n<p>He was right. Halfway from cleaning his rice, the door inside the shop was opened. A maidservant was showing Merly Yurin the way out. Shira quickly drank his juice, and asked the shopkeepers to wrap his unfinished meal. Since the wood plate already matted with banana leaves, wrapping unfinished meals should be easy. For people as great and magnomous as them, for sure they wouldn’t dislike a clueless boy for shamelessly asking to bring home a free meal, or so Shira thought.</p>\n<p>“Haha, you surely jest, Young Master. As long as you come back again with your friends, you can take home as many as you want. Here, go bring this home.”</p>\n<p>Shira asked to bring home his unfinished meal, but got a basketful of fresh banana leaves-wrapped braised chicken instead.</p>\n<p>Somehow, Shira couldn’t help but took a liking toward these people with ulterior motives. Whether it was Good-Natured Spirit or this hidden sect members, they gave him free stuff. Shira took a note to visit this shop after each time he won on a game of chess against Good-Natured Spirit. Surely they’d welcome him with open arms, just the way Good-Natured Spirit used to act, right?</p>\n<p>Shira escorted Merly Yurin back to the inn she stayed. When Sir Barront Staterwind and Jerrin Yurin saw them, they were happy to see Merly unscathed. Shira used this opportunity to clear the misunderstanding between them. Surprisingly, Merly cooperated well. Maybe she finally saw the light after being forced to kiss dirt by those masked women. Or maybe the hidden sect finally put some sense in the high and mighty esteemed lady Nalaq about how to act in southern Mossacks’ homeland. Whatever the reason, in the end, the relationship problem Yashura Family had with their guests was resolved by Shira. He himself wasn’t expecting the problem would be this easy to solve.</p>\n<p>It was already sunset when Shira walked back home. His mind wander as he thought of the diner would be tasteless. The shock this day was too much for Yashura Family. Even the coconut lover uncle wouldn’t have so much energy to cook after this devastating incident. It was a good thing he brought a bamboo basket full of banana leaves wrapped braised chicken with him.</p>\n<p>Accidentally, a bunch of kids playing tags brushing pass him, almost made him drop his banana leaves wrapped braised chicken. He thought of scolding these senseless kids. But the sight of a young girl laughing made him had a second thought. She made him remembered the Elzhier Family’s servant girl, the one who gave him the free voucher, a girl he believed affiliated with the hidden sect. And then he remembered one thing.</p>\n<p>“This pin isn’t even special,” he murmured, looking at the roaring lion pin Yulong gave him. But if it wasn’t special, why a girl of ten years old could decide whether to pass him to one of the hidden sect’s covered nests, based on this pin alone?</p>\n<p>He felt it wasn’t strictly Yashura Family that the hidden sect giving face. His uncle Patriarch Shuro was honest and clumsy, unlike the profesional Yulong, so at least the honest faces of Yashura Family he knew wouldn’t hiding anything like hidden sect or some other worrisome secret. He believed in Yashura Family’s innocence.</p>\n<p>And that was the time he realized the pin actually was a bit different than a normal one. There was a dent on its surface. The more he looked at it, the more he convinced that the dent wasn’t there accidentally. It was made to cover one of the lion’s eyes.</p>\n<p>“One-Eyed Lion.” A long forgotten phrase escaped his lips. One-Eyed Lion was the name of a delinquent group that his father made during his youth, that eventually won battles against bands of bandits outside and successfully securing path for merchants to safely trade with Badril Village, finally made a name for himself. When far away villages heard of Badril Village, they’d immediately remembered Jhuro Yashura and his gang the One-Eyed Lion.</p>\n<p>Shira didn’t know much about his father. He was almost never staying at home. And Patriarch Shuro, as gullible as he always was, never asked what his brother did outside the village. A headache came to him when he realized a bunch of mess he’d had to straighten out by the time he inherit the patriarch mantle because of this matter.</p>\n<p>“Yo kid, I saw you visit one of Big Boobs Sect’s place,” a haughty voice was heard. Shira groaned, quickly hid the pin he got, seeing the main nuisance finally showed himself again, with a cigarette between his fingers, carefreely floating with a punchable smirk on his face.</p>\n<p>“I thought you die.” Shira snorted.</p>\n<p>“What? The fuck did I do?” Good-Natured Spirit groaned as if he was wronged. The boy’s indignant eyes seemed to blame him upon the whole mess. “I didn’t do anything, alright. I did play my guitar, trying to flirt with her, but suddenly she wanted to melt my face with fireballs. What a salty bimbo, tsk.”</p>\n<p>“I saw you disrespected that lady Nalaq.”</p>\n<p>“Ey, I just touch her butts a little bit. And that was after she went nuts with her fireballs.”</p>\n<p>“I have the feeling you met her before and did her a great injustice. She was trying to kill you, like, really hard. Maybe she’s someone from the time when you were alive?”</p>\n<p>“Don’t know. Told you I don’t remember things from back when I’m alive.”</p>\n<p>“Then do you have any idea why she hates you so much?” Shira asked. “Aside, you know, your assault earlier.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit’s face turned solemn as he replied, “In this world, I fear no man, kid. But jealous exes? I fear them.”</p>\n<p>“It’s unbelievable to see my Yashura Family took the hit while you still shamelessly living and kicking,” Shira said icily, clearly didn’t believe what Good-Natured Spirit said. “No, I forgot, you already dead. I don’t understand why you always make trouble and acted as if you still can use that thing of yours.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit only scoffed at the boy’s remark. Seeing that the boy hugging a bamboo basket loaded with bunch of banana leaves wrapped rice meal with him, Good-Natured Spirit picked one and asked, “Is this your haul from Big Boobs Sect’s hiding place?”</p>\n<p>But at the same time the invisible to common eyes Good-Natured Spirit picked one of the braised chicken rice, a pedestrian happened to pass by, gasping at the sight of floating banana wrapped rice in the empty air.</p>\n<p>“Wh--what?!” the pedestrian gasped as his finger pointed at the supernatural thing happening before him. He saw Shira talked alone from afar, but he dismissed it knowing the rumors about Young Master Yashura was crazy from being spotted talking alone to empty air. Yet this time, the pedestrian thought he was the one that was crazy for seeing flying braised chicken rice.</p>\n<p>“Umm…”</p>\n<p>Shira wanted to explain things to the shocked pedestrian, but he took a step back as soon as Shira came forward.</p>\n<p>But then Good-Natured Spirit just carried on to open the braised chicken wrapping to see the content of the food.</p>\n<p>“No! Stay away from me!” the pedestrian cried in horror as he saw with his own eyes a flying braised chicken rice opening itself. Not wanting to spending a split second, he immediately ran away for his dear life.</p>\n<p>Shira was breathless seeing the scene unfolded. It was stupid if he didn’t think this wouldn’t begin another troublesome rumor about him. He looked aside, glaring at Good-Natured Spirit who was taking a whiff on the braised chicken he opened.</p>\n<p>“What?” Good-Natured Spirit raised his head. “The fuck did I do?”</p>\n<p>Annoyed, Shira forcefully grabbed the opened braised chicken rice from Good-Natured Spirit’s hands, put it back to the bamboo basket. He continued walking and pretended not to see the Nalaq.</p>\n<hr>\n","unregistered":[]},"novels/yashura-legacy/contents/volume-1/chapter-9.md":{"contributions":{},"lastModified":1589309303509,"data":{"title":"One Tulip Restaurant"},"body":"<p>When he arrived at Yashura Family’s gate, Shira saw Yulong was planting fresh torches around the road of Yashura Family. The boy then glanced beside him; much to his quiet expectation, the Nalaq who didn’t seem to get tired from pestering him before turning one-hundred-eighty degrees as he sneered toward the butler’s direction, waving his hand goodbye and floated away somewhere else.</p>\n<p>Shira always knew Good-Natured Spirit hated Yulong. And he always had a thought regarding the butler’s sophisticated pretense of ignorance. This was the day he confirmed Yulong could see Good-Natured Spirit, even though when he acted as if he didn’t the entire time. Shira saw Yulong smiling at him.</p>\n<p>“Are there still some people around working on cleaning up the debris, Yulong?” Shira asked. “I’ve got food for them.”</p>\n<p>Yulong received the basket full of wrapped food. One could smell from those the steaming banana leaves wrapped rice the aroma of delicious braised chicken. Yulong said to Shira, “Young Master, you did receive this from strangers. Did you manage to say thanks to them?”</p>\n<p>“Of course I did. They handed braised chicken for free, after all.”</p>\n<p>Yulong nodded. “Mm. You indeed have grown to a fine young man, young master.”</p>\n<p>Shira felt Yulong meant something else when he said that. The boy didn’t ask for a confirmation. He very well aware that Yulong would act dumb with the usual gentle smile of his. Before returning home, Shira wanted to return the pin Yulong gave him. But the butler told him to keep that one instead.</p>\n<p>“Go comfort your uncle and cousin, young master. Let me handle the accommodation for volunteers now.”</p>\n<p>In time of crisis, almost all of the elders except the really old ones who would stay in the family council to discuss the course of the matter. It was not because these elders were irresponsible bunch, far from it, they were quite patriotic instead, dabbling in dirts and sweats as the male elders came to the incident site to remove the debrises along with volunteers. However, in reality, they were afraid of coming to family council this evening. Since Yashura Family took a great hit financially, then it’d be a natural thing for the elder who managed family’s treasury to come forward in the meeting, and unfortunately this treasury elder was particularly the one all those elders were afraid of.</p>\n<p>“Nooo!! I am the Eldest Young Lady of this family! This is unfair!!!”</p>\n<p>A young woman’s squeal could be heard across the corridor. Shira stopped his track. There he saw Mila’s bawling face, eyes red with grievance, bursting out of the council hall. She hugged a pilar acting as if she was wronged, screaming toward the council hall, “What do you mean I shouldn’t buy cosmetic anymore? How come the Eldest Young Lady like me couldn’t get my rightful allowance to buy cosmetics any longer? Don’t you know if I don’t apply my usual cosmetic at least once every three days, my skin would go back tan and rough? In Elzhier Family, even a maidservant could afford cosmetic everyday--but why couldn’t I? Why can’t I? What’s the point of being the Eldest Young Lady if some mere servants have skin more beautiful than me? What’s the point?!”</p>\n<p>As if she couldn’t take it any longer, Mila Yashura running away covering her bawling face, screaming again, “I don’t want to be the Eldest Young Lady anymore!”</p>\n<p>The scene Mila throwing tantrum was seen by members of the family, even the servants watching the spectacle. Shira felt a headache coming from this cousin of his, did she aware throwing tantrum while being in her position could make the main family looked bad in front of outer family’s members?</p>\n<p>Yet just as Shira began to carry on, he suddenly heard a middle-aged man’s bawling reverberated across the whole family’s west wing.</p>\n<p>“What do you mean I can’t cook beef rendang anymore?!” Patriarch Shuro burst out from the council hall, thick moustache wet with snot, hugging a pilar and squealing at the direction of council hall acting as if he was wronged. “In Elzhier Family, even the most lowly servants can set up a stall selling beef stew and beef satay, they butcher cows once every three days and make delicious beef muchever they wanted--but why couldn’t I? Why can’t I? What’s the point of being the Patriarch if some lowly servants could cook food more delicious than me? What’s the point?!”</p>\n<p>Covering his crying face like a girl throwing tantrum, Patriarch Shuro running away with his scream echoing, “I don’t want to be Yashura Family Patriarch anymore!”</p>\n<p>Shira was dumbfounded. The outer family members and the servants were all dumbfounded. When Shira carefully glanced at these busybodies, they coughed awkwardly and dispersed immediately, acting as if they didn’t see anything.</p>\n<p>If Mila was the one who only throwing tantrum, Shira could understand. That tomboy actually could act immature every once in a while. But if his uncle also acting like that, then it mean nothing but trouble. The only time he could remember his uncle throwing tantrum was almost ten years ago, and the mess that time couldn’t be described as mere incidents. Knocking on the door the father and daughter duo escaping from, Shira then entered the council hall.</p>\n<p>“Elder Fhantir.”</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira, you’ve come.”</p>\n<p>Greeting him was an old man at the end of his age, smoking old-fashioned pipe, the wrinkles on his face made him looked even more evil than when he was younger. He was Elder Fhantir, the treasurer of Yashura Family, the most senior in elder council, the one who managed everyone’s salary and the food expense Yashura Family could use--in other words, the most powerful man in the entire Yashura Family.</p>\n<p>Elder Fhantir didn’t smile, only told Shira to sit down.</p>\n<p>“Is the treasury… really that bad, Elder Fhantir?” Shira asked.</p>\n<p>“We can afford to repair almost everything except the wall, young master,” Elder Fhantir began explaining, “back then, when your grandfather still leading the family as Patriarch Yashura, he contracted a specialist tribe to erect the wall, giving the responsibility to gather the material and to construct the wall themselves. They were the descendants of ancient Mossack builders tribe, they knew better than us. But everything was expensive. Especially the materials. The stone to build the one isn’t something you can get from digging river bed. They were extracted from a certain mountain one hundred miles away from here.”</p>\n<p>Shira could understand the severity behind Elder Fhantir’s words. From the beginning, Yashura Family could gain a foothold as the major family because they could afford to protect their family members when the time monsters swarm and bandit attacks were as common as pebbles at the side of the road. Elzhier Family might be well-connected and wealthy, and Malikh Family might be successful gaining influence over the course of past decades, but they were no way more dependable than Yashura Family in time of crisis. The story of previous Patriarch Yashura launching campaigns to eradicate volatile monster nests and Jhuro Yashura securing smooth trading routes were stories of legend the boys of current generation often romanticized.</p>\n<p>The sturdy wall of Yashura Family was something that previous patriarch left behind. It was the standing symbol of Yashura Family’s might. Compromising in repairing the wall with cheap materials was the same as undermining their own authority.</p>\n<p>Just as Shira could imagine how serious the situation was, Elder Fhantir continued giving him bad news, “That’s only the beginning of the problem. Now we need to figuring out how to contact that builder tribe, as the last Yashura Family elder who remembered the tribe’s location was Elder Thula who passed away seven years ago. And to make things worse, the one who made contract with them was your grandfather, not Yashura Family, so if we want to comission them, we need to sign them a new leash of contract.”</p>\n<p>Elder Thula was the previous Patriarch Yashura’s right hand man, who managed family’s external affairs, while Elder Fhantir was the left hand man, who tasked to gather and managed family’s financial account. Even Elder Thula didn’t know much about the builder tribe, much less Elder Fhantir, who usually dealt with internal matters.</p>\n<p>The grand elder reignited his pipe and inhaled it deeply. But Shira didn’t see the grand elder’s face relaxed. Instead, he became more solemn than before.</p>\n<p>“Is signing a new contract expensive?” Shira asked again.</p>\n<p>“Not quite. But you need to know, Young Master Shira, your grandfather wasn’t commissioning that tribe only to build our wall. He asked them to make weapons and advanced algiculture tools, quite in massive quantity and quality--massive enough to make them offer big discount on the wall budget cost. It was expensive. Very expensive. Even if we made our neighbors pay for our wall we’ll still be in the red.”</p>\n<p>Shadow crept upon the boy’s face. “That’s why my uncle was so freaked out about it all.”</p>\n<p>“It’s unfortunate, but we’ll have to sell all of our cows to Elzhier Family. The kitchen has to make do with goat meat for the next Ngajen Ceremony,” Elder Fhantir declared.</p>\n<p>Unlike his cousin and his uncle, Shira didn’t question Elder Fhantir’s decision. Owning a cow ranch was a symbol of influence in Badril Village, mainly because with stock of beef they could gain good impressions and reputation by cooking delicious food during Ngajen Ceremony. If Yashura Family sold all of their cows to Elzhier Family, it’d be the same as they surrendered the competition to their own rival.</p>\n<p>It was no wonder why Patriarch Shuro was very upset. Toward Elzhier Family, he felt only humiliation, especially after he didn’t manage to inherit the position of Badril Village Head from his father the previous Patriarch Yashura. Now that Yashura Family had once again bow to Elzhier Family, he must have felt nothing but worthlessness.</p>\n<p>“Make no mistake, Elzhier Family was never meant to be our rival,” Elder Fhantir said as if he read Shira’s thought, “in the first place, the one who referred your grandfather to that ancient builders tribe was now-retired elder Granny Niu Elang from Elzhier Family. Now that the connection has been cut off, we need to ask a great favor from her once again.”</p>\n<p>“You don’t need to explain it to me, Elder Fhantir. I’ve been knowing too much for a young master who hasn’t gone through his own age of ceremony yet.”</p>\n<p>“You are good. You didn’t scream when I told you the family’s current predicament, young master. You’ll make a fine patriarch in the future.”</p>\n<p>Just when Shira about to leave the council hall, Elder Fhantir gave him a message, “An injured lion need others’ help to survive, young master. But it doesn’t mean it won’t be able to roar again the next time.”</p>\n<p>Shira nodded. After stepping out of the hall, he looked back in pensive. Yashura Family members and other elders had long referring meeting face-to-face with Elder Fhantir was almost a death punishment. Just a glare from the mean-looking old elder could make legs turned jelly. But in a hard time, the boy actually was glad that Yashura Family had the final defense that heartless enough to face crisis with adversity. He wondered how many more people in Yashura Family who shared the same thought as him.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The mess in Yashura Family made Malikh Family looked very tranquil. By the next morning, Lyla Blackwood already was familiar enough with Malikh Family’s place she ran joyfully toward the kitchen with the tip of her toes.</p>\n<p>“Sistah Bhela, yuuhuuu~ yuhuu~~” Lyla greeted as she deeply took a whiff. Nothing was better than aroma of peanut sauce satay early in the morning. Bhela was squatting alone in front of kitchen, waving a fan for grilling satay, occasionally flipping bamboo skewered chicken satays. Lyla came to squat beside her, staring at the halfway done chicken satay, asking, “Sis Bhela, you’re making satay for your family’s breakfast?”</p>\n<p>“These are for us. Aunties inside are making chicken soup, they left me one chicken breast to cook as I see fit.”</p>\n<p>“How lucky! Thank you aunties in the kitchen!” Lyla shouted.</p>\n<p>From the kitchen window flashed one of the aunties’ face, replied her with a laugh, “Don’t mention it. You’re not staying here forever, Young Lady Lyla, so might as well eat every one of Mossack's original recipes!”</p>\n<p>“Ih wao! Such good aunties! Malikh Family aunties are the best!”</p>\n<p>Lyla was waiting for the chicken satay to cook. She couldn’t stop staring at the chicken juice dropping on burnt coconut shells below, which then later steamed and released the aroma of peanut sauce goodness. Not much time passed, Lyla droll began to well in her mouth.</p>\n<p>“Sis, can I fan satay too?”</p>\n<p>Instead of giving Lyla the fan she had on her hand, Bhela said to her, “Go ask aunties for a fan for you. And also ask whether the marinated gurame fish ready to be grilled.”</p>\n<p>“Is the fish for the two of us too?” Lyla asked with glimmering eyes.</p>\n<p>“Yes.”</p>\n<p>“Waawoooww!”</p>\n<p>The little happiness Lyla found in this humble village was that she could eat satay and grilled fish for breakfast. Back in Blackwood Family manor, Lyla wouldn’t even dare to dream for this to happen. Blackwood Family’s kitchen was forbidden for Lyla to enter, but the Malikh’s kitchen always open for her to plunder.</p>\n<p>Even the aunties liked her so much. As long as she was given food, Lyla was obedient unlike the boys and the girls her age. To be exact, Lyla almost never acted her age. That was why, in the past few days since she arrived Malikh Family, the aunties who worked in the kitchen liked to pamper her as soon as her cheerful and carefree behavior made them forgot her noble young lady title.</p>\n<p>And thus, instead of doing the task Bhela gave her and return immediately, Lyla sat on a wooden table while munching a salty cow skin cracker the aunties shoved her, swinging her legs back and forth as she lazily watching Granny Liltha scolding some young young maidservants.</p>\n<p>“How many times I have to tell you, don’t throw away edible cabbages!” the granny hissing as she knocked her walking stick on the ground as to make a protesting noise.</p>\n<p>“But Granny Litha,” one of the maidservants talked back, “Elder Jhamil ordered us to throw away all vegetables that have lost their colors!”</p>\n<p>Another young maidservant followed suit, “Yes, Elder Jhamil said that. He also said that the noble guest used to eat food different than us, so we all need to make sure we control our food quality before presenting them to noble guest from Blackwood Family. You may not know this, Granny Litha, but nobles can’t eat dirty food!”</p>\n<p>At the same time as the young maidservant fiercely arguing with the grumpy old lady, Lyla knocked the wooden bowl that held all the skin crackers aunties gave her, accidentally dropped them onto the floor. After making sure right and left that nobody realized her blunder, she squatted, picked the crackers on the floor, and patted them to get rid of the dirt.</p>\n<p>“Five second rule!” she rationalized. She then shoved them all quickly into her mouth. <em>Crunch crunch crunch.</em></p>\n<p>Standing up, she continued to watch the argument alongside the aunties, acting as if the heated arguments didn’t have anything to do with her.</p>\n<p>Because Granny Litha wasn’t someone with a golden tongue, in the end, she could only grumply use the oldest card in her sleeves--”Hmph! Back when I was your age, to eat a small leaf of cabbages was already a blessing! You young’uns really don’t know how lucky you are to live in time of peace where you don’t have to worry about monster swarms and bandit raids! Back then, don’t even mention rice, there were times that we didn’t even have millets to fill our bellies! Us old folks were so poor and hungry that we had to eat grass for our daily food!”</p>\n<p>Everyone in the kitchen already heard Granny Litha’s “back when I was your age” scolding for the thousand times, so her words entered their right ears then left through the left ears immediately. Well, everyone was, except Lyla.</p>\n<p>“I want to ask something, aunty,” Lyla said as she tugged the aunty’s sleeve who stood beside her.</p>\n<p>“What is it you want to know, Young Lady Lyla?” the aunty smiled, while seamlessly transferring one of the cinnamon buns on the tray that she had onto Lyla’s hand.</p>\n<p>Before proceeding with her question, Lyla quickly gobbled the cinnamon bun like a squirrel. After the bun gone she finally asked, “Is it true that people in Badril Village eat grass?”</p>\n<p>Smile on the aunty’s face froze. She looked at this girl asking that kind of question with such big, googly eyes. If she gave her a wrong reply, wouldn’t the girl think that Badril Village was such an uncivilized place for eating grass?</p>\n<p>“There are actually some types of grasses that can be eaten, don’t you know, Young Lady Lyla?” the aunty said with the straightest smile she could put on her face. “One particular grass, for example, called Paku Grass, which you can find easily in Badril Mountain’s valley. While Paku Grass usually boiled with herbs and dried fruits, its taste can change if you chew it raw thirty times--it becomes sweet just like how rice tastes if you chew it long enough!”</p>\n<p>“Iih wao! I didn’t know that!” Lyla exclaimed as her mouth gapped with “O” shape. The aunty nodded as she was glad that this sweet noble young lady wasn’t disgusted after knowing some people ate grass--which was something poorer folks had done to survive until past two decades, when the routes to trade was secured and the economy improved.</p>\n<p>Not much long after that Bhela entered the kitchen because she felt Lyla forgot about the fan and the marinated fish. But soon she realized the uncomfortable mood around the kitchen. She heard Granny Litha yelled something before. She too had grown dull with Granny’s “back when I was your age” scolding, so she didn’t remember what was that about.</p>\n<p>“What happened?” Bhela asked Lyla.</p>\n<p>Instead of answering, Lyla asked something unrelated, “Sis Bhela, don’t you know you actually can eat grass?”</p>\n<p>“Who said that?”</p>\n<p>“Granny Litha!”</p>\n<p>Thinking about it again, Bhela did recall Granny Litha yelling something about grass.</p>\n<p>“And Aunty Yaya said grass can become sweet if you chew it thirty times!”</p>\n<p>Bhela was angry at Aunty Yaya. Not because she was lying to Lyla, but because what she said was actually true. Eating grass was something Granny Litha said when she was furious, as people really did eat Paku Grass to survive everytime disaster struck in the old days. But nowadays nobody in Badril Village was so poor they had to eat grass anymore. Bhela didn’t know how to explain this to Lyla so she changed the topic back instead. “We need to grill our fish outside, there’s too much smoke inside. Where’s your fan?”</p>\n<p>“All the fans are being used by aunties to cook, except one,” Lyla told Bhela what she found after watching all the aunties working when she herself was busy eating cow skin cracker.</p>\n<p>“And where’s the fan that’s not being used to cook?”</p>\n<p>“There!” Lyla pointed at the old granny who, while grinding chillis to make <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">sambal</span>, grumpily fanned the smoke from coming to her face. It was her habit to fan herself when she was angry.</p>\n<p>Granny Litha didn’t have any spouse or significant others in her life. She was the old maiden, the kind who wouldn’t be able to get respect of her peers, because none of her relatives had been willing to step up in her time of crisis. So usually, when others need the fan, they just asked her casually. Nobody really respected her even though her skill in making spicy <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">sambal </span>was second to none. She could scold people but if there was no one to back her, she couldn’t really argue back when she was the one who was slowing others’ work.</p>\n<p>Bhela didn’t tell Lyla to ask the fan from Granny Litha, however. She needed Granny Litha’s <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">sambal</span> for the grilled gurame after all. She gave Lyla the fan in her hands instead.</p>\n<p>“Use this, and stop bothering aunties working. Let’s cook our fish outside now.”</p>\n<p>Holding the fan, Lyla ran outside, yelling, “Grill fish, I’m comiiiing!”</p>\n<p>Before following Lyla outside, Bhela came to Aunt Yaya, said, “Aunty Yaya, please don’t put any weird ideas inside Lyla’s head.”</p>\n<p>Aunt Yaya knew the young lady was complaining because she said too much about the grass. So she replied, “I’m sorry, Young Lady Bhela. It’s just if I don’t explain clearly to her, Young Lady Lyla would think lowly for us southerners to have to eat grass during hard times.”</p>\n<p>“Trust me,” Bhela said seriously, “that is not what she was thinking.”</p>\n<p>Bhela later told a servant to fetch her a wholesome banana leave directly from its tree. Although usually Lyla didn’t feel like working and doing some other boring stuff, she was surprisingly obedient when it came to her own food. She liked preparing the banana leave because it was kind of novel for her to eat food without using a plate--they laid the cleaned banana leave without cutting them, spread white rice, and decoratively lining up chicken satay along with those sweet peanut sauce that painted the rice brown with deliciousness. Finally, the grilled gurame fish was on top, poured with red spicy <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">sambal</span> that the aunties in the kitchen had prepared for them.</p>\n<p>Turned out eating like this, even without fork and knife that Lyla always thought was a hassle, Lyla found very satisfying and she liked it very much. Any food would feel so much good if eat with friends.</p>\n<p>The breakfast was private for the two of them. But even for the glouton Lyla, it was quite a festive she couldn’t ask for more.</p>\n<p><em>Buurrpp…</em></p>\n<p>The girl shamelessly burped while she patted her satisfied belly. “I’m pregnant with food, hihi. Look, Sistah, I’m preg--oiish oiish oiiiish… my naawse!”</p>\n<p>Bhela always punished her with a pinch on her nose everytime she burped or did some other stupid things.</p>\n<p>“You’re a girl, Lyla, how many times I told you to stop burping,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>That morning after their breakfast a young family elder came to Bhela, asking her to come to the family’s hall. Bhela was expecting for Elder Khasim to contact her, mainly due to the secret document she gave him, but she didn’t expect for Elder Khasim to work this fast.</p>\n<p>“Lyla,” Bhela called, “do you want to join me?”</p>\n<p>Lyla, who was busy on her knees trying to scrape the leftover satay peanut sauce on the banana leave, raised her head, asking, “Where to?”</p>\n<p>“Family Hall.”</p>\n<p>“Family Hall?” Lyla’s ear perked up. Wasn’t the Family Hall the place where all the food that the kitchen made gathered in one place? “Let’s go, Sis Bhela! Let’s go eat our next breakfast today!!!”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, in the Malikh’s family hall, the clamors amongst the common members of the family reverberated across the hall. Elder Jhamil tried very hard to appear calm, but his reddened face betrayed him regardless.</p>\n<p>On the opposite side, Elder Khasim calmly stroked his gray beard, his face brimmed with determination. Even his followers had hints of confidence in their eyes too. This morning, under the watchful gazes of all members of the Malikh Family, Elder Khasim accused Elder Jhamil of exploiting his position to gain benefits for himself and his own group. One must know beforehands that accusing an elder before their peers without the process of discussion in Council Hall was something unprecedented, even in the other major families. As one mistep could bite the accuser very, very bad. All this could tell that Elder Khasim wasn’t joking. He planned to go all out this very morning.</p>\n<p>At first, when the accusation landed, Elder Jhamil’s people were angry. They barked even louder than dogs to call Elder Khasim’s character as the family elder for slandering colleagues in front of common people. But soon Elder Khasim took out a scroll, reading one by one the deficit and the part where family owned materials mysteriously gone, forcing them to shut their mouth. Elder Khasim read it down to great details. The more he read, the more common members of Malikh Family get angry instead.</p>\n<p>“I originally don’t mind if some greedy people wanted to make some profits after their years of showing loyalty to Malikh Family,” with a biting sarcasm, Elder Khasim began his conclusion. “But one thing I couldn’t let go is the fact that our One Tulip Restaurant has lost its might and reputation in recent years. We might incompetent enough not to get proof all this years, Elder Jhamil, but nobody here was a fool.”</p>\n<p>When Elder Khasim mentioned One Tulip Restaurant, everyone’s face turned solemn. It was fine if it was another of Malikh Family’s businesses, but One Tulip Restaurant, beside had been providing Malikh Family with quite a significant income, was something that symbolic to Malikh Family’s history since a hundred years ago. This very restaurant was located in the nearest city in radius one hundred kilometers away, was originally a private business of the then Madam Malikh. When her husband passed away and her son too young to become the patriarch, she took control of the family and turned this simple restaurant to be a very strategic piece for Malikh Family’s expansion to outside world. One Tulip Restaurant was the reason Malikh Family got enough wealth to build their own family’s wall in the first place, which ultimately led them to establish themselves as the third major family of Badril Village. For an official to taint such a historical place with their greed, all members of Malikh Family wouldn’t be satisfied unless they got to drag the culprit all around the village, before shoving him to a lion monster’s den or worse.</p>\n<p>“Elder Khasim, why are you brought One Tulip Restaurant out of the sudden?” Elder Jhamil’s face was sneering, but his hidden palms couldn’t stop from sweating. “Here I sit through all of your bullshit waiting for your nonsense to over.</p>\n<p>“But what did I get? More nonsense, ceh! Do you want to throw mud on my face that bad to slander me in front of the entire Malikh Family? In your bullshit report you read before never once you mentioned One Tulip Restaurant!”</p>\n<p>“What are you saying, Elder Jhamil?” Elder Khasim just waved his hand at his opponent’s spat. “I only said that nobody here was a fool, I admit that we still haven’t found a single clue about One Tulip’s recession yet.” Actually, on the document Bhela gave him Elder Khasim found out about Elder Jhamil’s ridiculous corruption on One Tulip Restaurant. If not for the young lady’s reluctance for creating a complete chaos, Elder Khasim would gladly send this unreasonably greedy Elder Jhamil to his grave right here, right now.</p>\n<p>Elder Khasim then turned to the crowd, said, “You all heard the proof I’ve got against Elder Jhamil’s shameless corruption. You can trust me, I got it from a very incredible trusted source. I’m going to use my position as the senior elder of the Malikh Family to impeach Elder Jhamil for this reason. The problem now, is there anyone here still willing to trust Elder Jhamil on managing One Tulip Restaurant?”</p>\n<p>Everyone whispered to each other, but Elder Khasim knew nobody was willing to place their trust toward Elder Jhamil currently.</p>\n<p>“Elder Khasim,” the old elder who managed the treasury opened his mouth, “I’m willing to work this old bone to check through family’s account books to validate your accusation. And I also do believe we need to relieve Elder Jhamil from his position at One Tulip Restaurant’s manager for a while--at least until we know whether Elder Khasim is telling the truth. Elder Khasim staking his reputation to impeach Elder Jhamil in the public, after all.”</p>\n<p>“Elder, you…” Elder Jhamil was tongue-tied. This old elder was very friendly toward him previously. He also got fat from benefits especially these past few days from Blackwood’s bribing scheme.</p>\n<p>However, this slimey old elder was clever. Since One Tulip Restaurant was mentioned, he immediately washed his hands off from being connected to Elder Jhamil’s faction. Regardless of whether Elder Khasim was telling the truth or not, when the two factions were going to commit an all out war, best to be spectators along with other neutral elders and watch spectacle about to happen.</p>\n<p>It was at that time Bhela and Lyla arrived at the Malikh Family Hall. When a family servant announced their arrival, the squabbling elders immediately looked at the two girls. Elder Khasim wanted Bhela to sit in the elders spot to join the argument as the member of main family, but Bhela led Lyla to a spot where snacks were abundant instead. The girls had just had their breakfast--and they came here for the snacks, after all.</p>\n<p>Helpless for wanting the young lady’s full support, Elder Khasim then pretended that the Young Lady Bhela Malikh wasn’t informed of the Elder Jhamil’s corruption matter, explaining, “We just argue about Elder Jhamil’s crime, Young Lady Bhela. This might be cruel to ask a girl who hasn’t yet had her coming of her age ceremony; but since your mother is busy attending on your ill father, then we incompetent elders have no choice but rely on you, young lady. Please, take a look at this proof I’ve collected from my trusted source.”</p>\n<p>Elder Khasim stood up from his cross-legged sitting to deliver the proof to Bhela--the trusted source he referred to in his speech. Bhela originally wanted to appear solemn reading it, but Lyla just couldn’t eat brown sugar pudding without making a mess on her face, so Bhela had to take a napkin and wipe the pudding from Lyla’s face first.</p>\n<p>“Well?” after reading it, Bhela raised her head, aware of the entire family’s attention directed at her. “If this was my father, I’m sure he’s not willing to let Elder Jhamil operate One Tulip Restaurant until the suspicion is cleared.”</p>\n<p>Elder Khasim nodded. “That is the case, young lady. My heart was bleeding when I uncovered this dirty matter to the entire family--but that is only because I think we urgently need someone else to manage One Tulip Restaurant, not Elder Jhamil!”</p>\n<p>“Hmph!” Seeing that Elder Khasim wagging his tail in front of the young lady, Elder Jhamil harrumphed. His family was managing One Tulip Restaurant for three generations, how could he not see what the fella was really after?</p>\n<p>Seeing that the Young Lady Malikh was now busy explaining traditional cakes to her friend Young Lady Blackwood, Elder Jhamil decided to strike first as to leave a path for himself.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela, I admit during my official duty I let some of my subordinates slip up due to my negligence--I admit guilty on some of Elder Khasim’s accusation!” he said with loud voice. “However, young lady, if you really are representing the main family, then please consider this matter carefully! One hundred years ago, Matriarch Malikh trusted One Tulip Restaurant to my grandfather, I don’t believe she’ll be happy in after life if some busybodies covet her precious legacy!”</p>\n<p>Elder Khasim sneered at Elder Jhamil. Couldn’t this moron see that Young Lady Bhela he plead to was the one who actually orchestrated his downfall? “And then, who would you suggest to pass on your position, Elder Jhamil?”</p>\n<p>Seeing that smug look on Elder Khasim’s face, Elder Jhamil turned vigillant. He glanced at Bhela who carefreely cracking nuts for Lyla to eat. Something wasn’t quite right, but he didn’t know what.</p>\n<p>“Ehem,” Elder Jhamil began. “My son is an excellent young elder who recently got into service of Malikh Family’s council, young lady. He’s excellent in arithmetic and his Level and Class is also appropriate to be in position of leadership--I suggest you see him to understand how capable he is!”</p>\n<p>“I’ve seen him. In the kitchen.” Bhela said cooly. “Anyone who doesn’t know the rules of the kitchen shouldn’t be let working into any food stall, much less One Tulip Restaurant.”</p>\n<p>Chuckles and muffled snickers were heard from Elder Khasim’s side. Elder Jhamil’s face just got redder than he normally was.</p>\n<p>Presenting a nephew of his, Elder Khasim confidently said, “This is someone I’d like to recommend, Young Lady Bhela. I believe my nephew’s education and honesty is something that everyone already knows. Young Lady Bhela too, who was busy studying for two years abroad, also knew his excellence upon your return, I assume?”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” Bhela said. She glanced at the scholarly young man beside Elder Khasim. “But can he make sambal?”</p>\n<p>Elder Khasim, who originally smug, blinked his eyes at Bhela’s question. “Sambal? Pardon my young lady?”</p>\n<p>“I want to know whether he knows how to make a sambal or not.”</p>\n<p>Elder Khasim’s nephew was a scholar who had a strong grasp on arithmetic. But he never worked in the kitchen. Scratching his head, he wryly replied, “My current job isn’t requiring me to learn how to make sambal, young lady.”</p>\n<p>Bhela was calm. She said, “No matter who’s in charge of One Tulip Restaurant, it’s gonna decline eventually. It’s because one particular reason; in the past, One Tulip Restaurant often praised by foreigners for a place to get the best sambal in the whole southern lands, but over the years no one could replicate the original sambal. For that certain reason One Tulip Restaurant isn't as popular as it used to be. Choosing a manager is no simple matter. But the main family’s requirement for One Tulip Restaurant’s new manager is simple. We want someone dedicated who makes a great sambal, someone who can lead One Tulip Restaurant to recover its past glory.”</p>\n<p>Still blinking his eyes awkwardly, Elder Khasim then asked, “Young lady, are you perhaps have someone in mind to appoint as One Tulip Restaurant’s manager?”</p>\n<p>“No,” Bhela said straightforwardly.</p>\n<p>“Then how about--”</p>\n<p>“But I can ask a foreigner for her opinion.”</p>\n<p>Elder Khasim wanted to say something but Bhela went ahead asking the foreigner she mentioned, anyway.</p>\n<p>She asked, “Who do you think makes the most delicious sambal in Malikh Family, Lyla?”</p>\n<p>Lyla’s eyes shone. Such an easy question! “Of course it’s Grandma Litha! Grandma Litha’s sambal is super delicious!”</p>\n<p>“Mm. Grandma Litha it is.”</p>\n<p>And thus, as the Young Lady of the Malikh Family had declared, Litha Malikh, known as Grandma Litha, or Cranky Old Granny as some called her, became the manager of One Tulip Restaurant. As their presence no longer needed, Bhela pulled Lyla’s hand, said, “Let’s go, Lyla.”</p>\n<p>Lyla stood up after she plundered cakes and pastries she was able to bring outside. They just sat there in less than three minutes, but already solved one of the biggest political battles that happened in Malikh Family’s history.</p>\n<p>Common family members who were watching, although they hadn’t had any good impression toward cranky Granny Litha, was quite satisfied by Young Lady Bhela’s decision--mostly because they felt good upon hearing Lyla said their family’s sambal was super delicious. After all, Lyla Blackwood was a blue blood noble young lady through and through. Receiving praise from such a person made them overproud. But sophisticated ones like the elders had different reactions than common people.</p>\n<p>“Isn’t Granny Litha that one hateful Granny who is very hard to please?” someone whispered from Elder Jhamil’s faction.</p>\n<p>“Isn’t Granny Litha is Elder Jhamil’s blood relative aunt?” someone whispered from Elder Khasim’s side.</p>\n<p>Upon returning back from their shock, Elder Khasim and Elder Jhamil both sprang up and shouted, “Please wait, Young Lady Bhela!”</p>\n<p>Chasing across the corridor, both elders then found Bhela and Lyla already wasn’t there. Elder Khasim found himself together with his rival Elder Jhamil as he gathering his breath. Both of them harrumphed, turned around and walked away in two completely different reacting.</p>\n<p>Elder Khasim then returned to his followers, who were anxious waiting for his return. One of them asked, “Elder Khasim, is Young Lady Bhela serious on pointing Granny Litha as the manager of One Tulip Restaurant?”</p>\n<p>Although he too was feeling doubt and disappointment, but Elder Khasim knew Young Lady Bhela wouldn’t be joking around after secretly giving him the weapon to jab Elder Jhamil’s faction. “It seems that is the case,” he gravely nodded.</p>\n<p>“Then is Young Lady doesn’t trust us in the first place?” someone asked.</p>\n<p>“Is this how Young Lady Bhela putting us in place after making a ruckus attacking Elder Jhamil’s faction?”</p>\n<p>“I knew it! Ah, just when we got us grip on Elder Jhamil’s weakness! Young Lady Bhela isn’t yet going through her coming of age ceremony, we should’ve invited her mother Madam Malikh instead!”</p>\n<p>“You! Watch your mouth!” Elder Khasim furiously slapped the last person’s cheek. “It’s already good enough for a member of the main family answering our invitation, you’ve got guts to question her integrity! Don’t you know this faction is over if we offend Young Lady Bhela now?!”</p>\n<p>The elder who got slapped was ashamed when his colleagues all stared at him. He quickly backed away. Everyone there knew they hadn’t got any chance when they asked Madam Malikh to support their faction, so even if Young Lady Bhela gave them a copper Kobe koin then they could be considered lucky.</p>\n<p>After the mood recovered, someone asked, “Elder Khasim, what are we supposed to do now?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know,” Elder Khasim shook his head. “I’m going to talk with Young Lady Bhela and ask for the main family’s intention. You all should wait and see, don’t make ruckus and question the main family in the open!”</p>\n<p>In the end, they all could only sighed as they couldn’t fathom Young Lady Bhela’s real intention.</p>\n<p>This scene also happened on Elder Jhamil’s side. Reporting to Butler Tim, they both racked their brains trying to guess Bhela Malikh’s thought.</p>\n<p>“Isn’t giving the position to your aunt is like taking from right hand to move it to the left one?” Butler Tim asked. “Is that enemy of yours already fell out of her favors?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know yet, suppose that she really did want to limit Elder Khasim’s faction from getting too much power,” Elder Jhamil said, though he wasn’t too sure about his own words.</p>\n<p>“You guys think too much,” a young woman with revealing garments said lazily as she painted her toe in the corner of the room. “That girl is like my Young Lady Lyla, beside having lucky with her Unique Class, all she does is play with Young Lady Lyla all day. Could that kind of girl smart enough to play around a bunch of middle-aged elders in the palms of her hands?”</p>\n<p>“You, what are you saying?” Butler Tim wasn’t feeling too good seeing this maidservant in his room. “Didn’t I say not to let Young Lady Lyla spend too much time with Bhela Malikh? Do you know because Young Lady Lyla opened her mouth, now Elder Jhamil’s people had a hard time reversing Bhela Malikh’s decision? Why were you letting her going outside in the first place?”</p>\n<p>“She said she wanted to take a dump, so of course I had to let her go!” the maidservant snarled.</p>\n<p>“And you believed her? That is literally the one and only excuse Young Lady Lyla used whenever she wanted to slip away!”</p>\n<p>“Why are you blaming me now? Weren’t you the one who said you missed me?!”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil took a step back. Trapped in the middle of lovers’ fight, truly felt like he was stuck in two hard places.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, Butler Tim didn’t want to bother with her, and told Elder Jhamil to go bribing his aunt Granny Litha and try to protect his men position in One Tulip Restaurant. Elder Jhamil felt the same. His family might not have contact with Granny Litha, but if he smoothen it up, wouldn’t it be easy to get One Tulip Restaurant back to his pocket?</p>\n<p>This was also especially what Elder Khasim and his followers worried about. The main reason why Elder Jhamil got a hold of the family’s inner working in the first place was because he got too many privileges of being the manager of One Tulip Restaurant. The moral of Elder Khasim’s faction dwindled as they realized their Young Lady Bhela wasn’t in the family to be contacted. Meanwhile, Elder Jhamil came to the kitchen to make a deal with Granny Litha before everyone else could influence the cranky old granny.</p>\n<p>“You want me to preserve some of your friends positions?” Granny Litha asked Elder Jhamil with hands making sambal.</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, we are family after all, Aunty Litha. I’ve got some problems to deal with thus I can’t manage One Tulip Restaurant for now, so Young Lady Bhela found you to supervise it in my stead!”</p>\n<p>Granny Litha didn’t immediately answer. She looked at this nephew of hers up and down, scrutinizing.</p>\n<p>“Back when I was your age, I kissed my elders’ hands before asking anything to them. What’s up with this generation, where’s your politeness?”</p>\n<p>“Please, Aunt Litha, not now! You must’ve been tired working in the kitchen all these years, right? How about I make you a nice house in the inner family complex? I’ll build you a big one, how about it?”</p>\n<p>Still occupied in grinding her sambal, Granny Litha stopped grinding and said, “Tell me your most trusted friends and their positions.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil prepared to lose more in this negotiation, but he didn’t expect it to be this easy!</p>\n<p>Excited, he grabbed a stool and sat in front of Granny Litha, telling her the information she was gonna needed if Granny Litha was to help him retain his influence inside One Tulip Restaurant.</p>\n<p>The aunties and the maidservants quietly eavesdropped on their conversation. They’d never seen Elder Jhamil acted like that in front of Granny Litha--usually, even though she was his blood relative aunt, Elder Jhamil never bothered to greet her, acting as if they were strangers, much less behaving in front of Granny Litha. This made them felt complicated, as they’d thought Granny Litha was very much abandoned by her maiden family due her inability to attract a spouse. After all, even the lowest ranking maidservants treated Granny Litha like an air everytime she nagged with her “when I was your age” phrase.</p>\n<p>Granny Litha finally finished making sambal, scooped the red paste of chillis into a wooden bowl before she looked at Elder Jhamil’s face, said, “Are you sure Young Lady Bhela is the one who appointed me?”</p>\n<p>All smiles, Elder Jhamil said, “Yes, Aunt Litha. Everyone in the family hall heard her said that.”</p>\n<p>Granny Litha stood.</p>\n<p>“Very well,” she said, she then faced from the crowd of eavesdropping aunties, “Yaya, Umha, you two come here.”</p>\n<p>Aunty Yaya and one aunty who was dull and slow in her nature, stiffly trotted toward Granny Litha.</p>\n<p>“Granny, you called?” Aunty Yaya asked, awkwardly kept her distance from the nortrious Elder Jhamil.</p>\n<p>“Yaya,” Granny Litha said slowly, “you’re the most hateful and stupid person ever worked in this kitchen, you never even pretended listening to my words ever since you worked here. However, you cook very well.”</p>\n<p>“Y-yes?” Aunty Yaya wasn’t sure Granny Litha was completing her or not.</p>\n<p>Granny Litha looked at the other aunty. “Umha, you’re the most dull person instead. I agree with everyone here to keep you away from the cooking pot--boiled water is the most suited for you to make.”</p>\n<p>This middle-aged aunty called Umha was dejected Granny Litha mentioned her shortcoming in front of everyone. Like Aunty Yaya, she wasn’t sure why Granny Litha even called her speciasifically.</p>\n<p>“However,” Granny Litha continued, “I always noticed you always prepared uniformed chillies for me, and since you were tasked on picking fruits and vegetables I never once doubt you’re going to make a mistake like accidentally picking a rotting fruit. You’re slow, but always careful and very detailed. So you’ll be the accountant for One Tulip Restaurant from now on.”</p>\n<p><em>Claaank!</em></p>\n<p>A maidservant accidentally dropped a ceramic plate somewhere in the kitchen. But no eyes were even moving at her. Everyone was struck dumb by Granny Litha sudden appointment on making a dull aunty an accountant for the legendeary One Tulip Restaurant.</p>\n<p>“Aunt Litha!!!” Elder Jhamil jumped from his stool with horror on his face, “y-you can’t! These servants can’t work in prestigious place like One Tulip Restaurant!”</p>\n<p>Granny Litha ignored the freaked Elder Jhamil, then said to Aunty Yaya, “Yaya, you unlikable lass, help me cook in One Tulip Restaurant, I don’t like it but I suppose you’ll be the head chef from now on!”</p>\n<p>“M-me…?” Aunty Yaya stammered as she pointed her face with trembling fingers.</p>\n<p>“Yes, you. Do you want me to pick someone else?”</p>\n<p>Aunty Yaya didn’t reply, as she wasn’t sure how to reply to that question.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil, who realized this aunt of his was actually unreasonable like the young lady that appointed her as the manager of One Tulip Restaurant, now thought that he needed softer measure to make Granny Litha realized the error in her way.</p>\n<p>“Aunt Litha, if you’re unreasonable like this, then even the main family wouldn’t be able to defend you if the elders council all banded together to take back your newly acquired position!”</p>\n<p>Granny Litha didn’t want to bother with this nephew who never wanted to acknowledge her for years. The old woman brought her bamboo fan with her walking around the kitchen, searching for a particular face she vaguely remembered in her mind. Moments later, she stood in front of a sixteen years old young maidservant of the lowest ranking, whose job was no more than peeling fruits and cleaning vegetables.</p>\n<p>“What’s your name?” Granny Litha asked.</p>\n<p>“My name is Rara,” the maidservant replied, her eyes blinking confusedly.</p>\n<p>“No Malikh surname?”</p>\n<p>“No, my mother is a maidservant, and my father is a hunter from outside the family. My mother said it’s still five years more for me to get a Malikh surname if I don’t make trouble while working in the kitchen.”</p>\n<p>“You don’t need to wait five years. Come with me to meet Grand Elder to get your Malikh surname.”</p>\n<p>“Eeehh? Granny Litha?” unlike Aunty Yaya and Aunty Umha who were dumbfounded, the girl maidservant stood up and took a few steps back, hesitated.</p>\n<p>“What? You afraid? I saw you carved some rabbit figures for Young Lady Lyla when you were in your break. You’ve got talents. So I want you as my chief decorator.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil grunted. The smile on his face swept away by his disgust. If the aunties who basically were servants bad enough, then appointing a young maidservant with no Malikh surname was akin to losing one mind. Elder Jhamil felt that One Tulip Restaurant would turn into ruin if Granny Litha just did whatever she wanted to do.</p>\n<p>“Aunt Litha, my late grandfather wouldn’t be resting in peace if you mess his One Tulip Restaurant! Please reconsider this!”</p>\n<p>“His restaurant? Bah!” Granny Litha spat. “Even when he was alive, he wouldn’t dare to claim Matriarch’s One Tulip Restaurant as his own!”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was taken aback. It was then he realized he just spat some words that, if said in front of those hateful fellows from Elder Khasim’s faction, would end his whole career for good.</p>\n<p>“Yaya, Umha, and you lass, meet me in front of Grand Elder’s house. After we get Rara her surname, we’ll go to where One Tulip Restaurant is. There are loads of work waiting for you there!”</p>\n<p>Aunty Umha, who originally was the most timid aunty out of all them, asked stammeringly, “D-do we have to pay for the carriage cost ourselves?”</p>\n<p>“Let’s go!” Aunty Yaya pulled Aunty Umha’s and also fetched the young maidservant Rara out of the kitchen. With Elder Jhamil’s face red with rage like that, she decided it was best to not linger around in the kitchen any longer.</p>\n<p>For matter as big as One Tulip Restaurant, servants’ opinions like theirs weren’t important. Aunty Yaya prayed that both Young Lady Bhela and Granny Litha weren't just messing around with the whole arrangement. After all, if a petty man with Elder Jhamil’s caliber took his anger, then there was no hope for Aunty Yaya and the others to live in Malikh Family anymore.</p>\n<p>Malikh Family had only one Grand Elder. This elder was an old man that had celebrated his one hundred years birthday a few years ago, with no particular ability of being the most respectable elder except for his seniority. Everyone called him Grand Elder Malikh, the last gatekeeper of Malikh’s policies, most respectable that even Ghalim Malikh would ask his opinion for big matters back when the Malikh Patriarch was in his prime.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil, knowing he couldn’t talk sense to his aunt, quickly set off complaining to Grand Elder before Granny Litha could get the Malikh surname for the young maidservant called Rara. He reached the Grand Elder’s house before them, but unexpectedly Elder Jhamil met with Elder Khasim there.</p>\n<p>“Grand Elder,” Elder Jhamil decided to ignore his political rival, proceeded to report instead, “as you might already know, Young Lady Bhela used her position as the eldest young lady of the main family to appoint my aunt Litha Malikh as the new manager of One Tulip Restaurant. Yet, due to her lack of exposure to the family’s ethic and education in her youth, she did an unreasonable turnover without putting too much thought. She plans to switch One Tulip Restaurant’s key positions with servants who worked in the kitchen!”</p>\n<p>“Oh, she did?” Elder Khasim remarked as he poured warm tea for Grand Elder Malikh. Seeing that the fella Jhamil freaking out put a smile on his face. He smelled something foul, maybe if he dug deeper, he could get on something to pin Elder Jhamil down.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil glared at him. Although he didn’t want to drop stone onto his foot, as a veteran politician, he knew the principal of taking control before the damage spread.</p>\n<p>“Grand Elder, I know my aunt is old and a bit reasonable. I’m willing to take responsibility for her mistake if she happened to be ignorant of the common rules. But not only did she appoint servants, she also picked a young one of the lowest ranking that doesn’t have Malikh surname!”</p>\n<p>The last sentence Elder Jhamil uttered frozen Elder Khasim’s smile. No wonder this snake Elder Jhamil admitting mistakes in front of his own enemy; turned out this fella wanted to use him to defend his own family reputation.</p>\n<p>Elder Khasim unwillingly said, “Now that I’ve heard Granny Litha did something that makes the legitimacy of One Tulip Restaurant be put under question, I can’t stay silent anymore. Grand Elder, I hope you can give warning to Granny Litha when she comes to seek your guide.”</p>\n<p>Grand Elder Malikh was old and tired. Both the elders weren't sure whether he actually heard what they were saying with that sleepy expression he had. Slowly, Grand Elder picked his glass of tea, drank it, put it back--but he didn’t say anything to reply to both of the elders.</p>\n<p>“Grand Elder, what is it your say regarding this matter?” Elder Jhamil cautiously probed.</p>\n<p>Again, Grand Elder said nothing. He only murmured some inaudible whispers to himself.</p>\n<p><em>Knock knock.</em></p>\n<p>“Old man, I’m coming,” Granny Litha’s figure entered the house as soon as her voice resounded. Granny Litha sat in front of Grand Elder along with Elder Khasim and Elder Jhamil, she didn’t even ask permission as she brought three servants from the kitchen with her. From the way they looked, changing clothes they wore and carrying clothed bags with them, it seemed Granny Litha wanted to bring the three of them to go outside the village.</p>\n<p>“I need you to approve Malikh surname for this lass, old man. My carriage is waiting outside. So quickly make it official, don’t waste anyone’s time!”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil gasped in horror as Granny Litha impudently raised her voice as if she was already getting impatient even though she had just entered. The aunties and the maidservant behind her already pale beyond paper sheet--they now realized their future had been jeopardized by the time Granny Litha selected them. Even Elder Khasim, who originally enjoyed seeing Elder Jhamil stumbled by this unreasonable relative of his, had a half-smile wryly plastered on his face. The Grand Elder Malikh himself, however, didn’t seem to have any opinion regarding the rude behavior. He just went on searching for his stamp.</p>\n<p>“Now, lass, you want to join our proud Malikh Family? Come here,” he said while waving his hand.</p>\n<p>The young maidservant Rara wasn’t this timid originally. Scary Granny Litha beside her, and two higher ups elders staring at her like hawks in front of her. Although it was her dream to get a better life for her family by getting officially recognized in the Malikh Family, the heavy atmosphere made her limbs feel like noodles. She felt she didn’t want to be a Malikh anymore.</p>\n<p>“Why are you still hesitating lass?” Granny Litha impatiently slapped her thigh. “Back when I was your age, us little girls all had to face Elder Bhantul to get permission to go outside! This lazy old foggy is nowhere as scary as Elder Bhantul!”</p>\n<p>Just as Elder Jhamil wanted to plead his aunt to shut her mouth for her own good, Grand Elder Malikh chuckled on the side.</p>\n<p>“Elder Bhantul sure is scary. Matriarch Malikh promoted him out of the blue just so that she could make us naughty elders regret our mistakes,” Grand Elder muttered with nostalgic expression. Back when he first started his career as a young elder in the council, Grand Elder Malikh suffered a lot under Elder Bhantul’s oppression.</p>\n<p>Eventually the young maidservant Rara became Rara Malikh only because Granny Litha pulled her hand impatiently. There were not many low-ranking servants proposed to the family to get surnames in Malikh Family, therefore Grand Elder Malikh never had the need to outsource his responsibility as the most senior elder to grant surnames. That didn’t mean Elder Khasim and Elder Jhamil didn’t know how the procedure was, however. They were baffled seeing how unusually accommodating Grand Elder Malikh was to this nameless servant.</p>\n<p>“Here you go, young lass,” Grand Elder Malikh said after he stamped a fine white paper document. “Your Rara Malikh from now on. Please do always remember that your identity and action will reflect Malikh Family from this point onward. You’re one of us.”</p>\n<p>“Th-thank you, Grand Elder,” Rara Malikh stammeredly replied.</p>\n<p>The paper she received felt it was heftier than the giant cauldron she always tasked to set up whenever Ngajen Ceremony came. She never touched a white paper as fine as this, much less an official document.</p>\n<p>Elder Khasim sighed, while Elder Jhamil’s face was sour. Now that Grand Elder had demonstrated that he didn’t have any intention to make One Tulip Restaurant’s transition harder, both the two elders knew the restaurant was Granny Litha’s for good.</p>\n<p>“Litha,” Grand Elder Malikh muttered as Granny Litha about to lead the others walking out of the door.</p>\n<p>“What is it again, old foggy?”</p>\n<p>Grand Elder looked at her with a hint of pensive look on his eyes.</p>\n<p>“Neither Patriarch Ghalim or I had succeeded in convincing you to return back to One Tulip Restaurant again. What is it that made you change your mind this time?”</p>\n<p>“You’re asking me this, old foggy? Why don’t you ask the fools beside you who almost gnawed Malikh Family inside out? I’m going to One Tulip Restaurant simply because the main family asked me to.”</p>\n<p>“Mm, is that so?” Grand Elder nodded off his head, looking about to fall asleep. “But I thought you’ll never care about One Tulip Restaurant again unless Matriarch Malikh personally comes to ask you to.”</p>\n<p>Granny Litha didn’t say anything. She carried on leading the other aunties and newly made Rara Malikh out of Elder Ghalim’s house, who was sighing as the door being closed.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil, who didn’t want to give up on protecting his interest, whispered words to Grand Elder Malikh, afraid that Elder Khasim from hearing it. “Grand Elder, I know you don’t have any problem in promoting my aunt to manage One Tulip Restaurant. But how about the entire elders council body? The one who appointed her was Young Lady Bhela, after all. She was a girl of fifteen who hasn’t had her coming of age ceremony yet. How do you intend to explain this to everyone? Wouldn’t this be a problem if people question Young Lady Bhela’s credibility to represent the main family in the future?”</p>\n<p>“What’s there to explain?” Grand Elder shook his head. “Main family already appointed Litha to manage One Tulip Restaurant before. It can only be a good thing if she returned back to One Tulip Restaurant.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil didn’t have a good feeling about this. “Grand Elder, would you please tell me more about this? Who was the one who appointed her? Why don't I know about this matter?”</p>\n<p>“Seventy years ago. Matriarch Malikh the one who gave her One Tulip Restaurant.”</p>\n<p>Grand Elder Malikh rubbed his long white beard as he enjoyed the tea Elder Jhamil poured for him. After raising his head, he found that even Elder Khasim who pretended the best not to be noticed eavesdropping had a dumbfounded look on his face, alongside Elder Jhamil, whose face even worse.</p>\n<p>The old elder clicked his tongue. “What? You two didn’t even know Litha was the only Matriarch Malikh’s disciple too? Aha, of course you wouldn’t. The foggies who snatched One Tulip Restaurant from her were already dead, after all. It’s already a miracle Litha is willing to forget past grudges for the greater good of Malikh Family!”</p>\n<p>Grand Elder sighed once again as he recalled the sweet girl who always grinding sambal under the guidance of Matriarch Malikh. The young Grand Elder Malikh remembered how Matriarch loved the girl like she was her daughter that she never had. Litha was fourteen years old when Matriarch Malikh decided to retire and gone on a journey with her lover, and she was sixteen when she found out her own relatives schemed against her. Alone and betrayed, the young Litha Malikh retreated to the kitchen where she always spending time with Matriarch Malikh, grinding sambals days upon days, ignoring the love-stricken young men who tried to comfort her, all for the sake for doing her best to preserve the legacy her master left behind.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela and our guest from Blackwood Family were the ones who managed to get Litha returned to One Tulip Restaurant again, isn’t it? It’s good. It’s good…”</p>\n<p>For a long time Grand Elder Jhamil felt heart-broken and regret whenever he saw the entire Malikh Family letting the then dearest and most talented Matriarch’s disciple lost her brilliance halo, belittled and forgotten. Since Grand Elder himself was one of those young men who failed to get her heart, naturally he was happy to see this development.</p>\n<p>In contrast, Elder Jhamil’s face turned pale. His father gave One Tulip Restaurant to him, but the past scandal had eluded the resourceful Elder Jhamil. Even the revelation of Granny Litha’s past identity as the disciple of Matriarch Malikh shocked him greatly. The uncomfortable feeling burst inside him. And when he saw Elder Khasim quietly smiled, Elder Jhamil knew he was screwed big time.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Although Yashura Family had gotten a part of their wall turned into debris because of reasons they didn’t want to talk about, something weird also happened on the other side of Badril Village. A cranky old woman was chosen as Malikh Family’s One Tulip Restaurant manager. People were laughing it off as a joke, saying Malikh Family really had nothing to do that they promoted an expired old maiden to their most prestigious restaurant.</p>\n<p>But some, mostly organizers of Ngajen Ceremony, aunties and chefs, all sort of people who dealt with food, actually knew Granny Litha and the fact that she was the mind behind Malikh Family’s undeniably most delicious sambal known in recent decades. The news about this made others happy, especially the Elzhier Family. Now that those hateful Yashuras somehow managed to get their asses screwed by strange incidents and the most powerful sambal maker of Malikh Family was gone, Patriarch of Elzhier Family felt it was time for the Elzhiers to experience their long-awaited meteoric rise.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Granny Litha and others were loading their stuff onto the water buffalo carriage. Aunty Yaya and others were feeling lost. The three of the newly made restaurant higher ups, especially the young Rara Malikh, were overwhelmed by curious gazes of onlookers. Even after taking a deep breath, still they weren’t sure about their sudden promotion.</p>\n<p>“Oh,” Aunty Yaya’s face brightened as she saw a familiar face amongst the onlookers, “isn’t that Jeng Kheles?”</p>\n<p>The middle-aged woman Aunty Yaya referred to was a social butterfly servant of Elzhier Family, and she had a good relationship with Aunty Yaya. However, upon knowing that she was being noticed, the servant called Jeng Kheles turned her head and trotted away. She acted as if they didn’t know each other.</p>\n<p>“You’ll get used to it,” the coarse voice of Granny Litha resounded behind her.</p>\n<p>Aunty Yaya cast her gaze down. The cranky Granny Litha, the nervous Aunty Umha, and ex-maidservant Rara Malikh, who hugging her coarse travelling bag, looking almost at her limit of having a mental breakdown--couldn’t she see some sweeter faces other than these unpleasant folks before they set off for One Tulip Restaurant?</p>\n<p>“Yuuhuuu~~~ hellow there Malikh aunties!”</p>\n<p>Lyla Blackwood and Bhela Malikh came unexpectedly. Aunty Yaya was surprised. They heard the Blackwood Family escorts were looking for this Young Lady Lyla everywhere, but here she was, tip-toeing around with a big bamboo basket she hugged close to her chest. Wearing dull-looking clothes that had its color faded, coupled with her bun-styled hair, she looked no different than any other Badril Village girls on the street. No wonder people sent by Butler Tim of Blackwood Family couldn’t locate their carefree young lady.</p>\n<p>“Ah, Young Lady Lyla, what are you doing here?!” Aunty Yaya asked with her voice suppressed.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to rice paddies! We’re going to gather rice field conch!” Lyla replied with eyes full of anticipation. She continued, “I’m going to fill this basket with delicious rice field conch, and Sis Bhela would skewer them into spicey satays for lunch!”</p>\n<p>“What? How could a noble young lady like you jump into mud to gather dirty rice field conches?” Aunty Yaya had a headache looking at these two troublesome young ladies before her. “More importantly, Young Lady Bhela, why would you bring your bow if you were only going to go to rice paddies?”</p>\n<p>Bhela, contrast to Lyla who carried a large basket to gather conch, had her shortbow and quiver full of arrows with her. “After rice field, we’re going to mountain,” Bhela replied.</p>\n<p>“We’re going to hunt wild goats!” Lyla exclaimed. “And Sis Bhela would skewer them into peanut sauce satays for lunch!” Sneakily, she wiped her droll that unfortunately leaked after she mentioned delicious satays a few times. Clearly Lyla was looking forward to her lunch this afternoon.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” Aunty Yaya asked with a pleading tone, “don’t you know Blackwood Family is looking for Young Lady Lyla?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, I know. That’s why we’re crashing in Elzhier Family now,” Bhela replied.</p>\n<p>“Hihi, people here don’t recognize my face. They won’t find me if I bun my hair this way,” Lyla giggled, referring to her hair bun style that was popular only in commoners circle. She didn’t realize, though, even if she didn’t bother disguised herself with different hair style, nobody would recognize a girl with bamboo basket in her hands as a noble young lady if she kept yelling about gathering conch on rice paddies every few minutes or so.</p>\n<p>Aunty Yaya groaned as she didn’t know how to handle the naughty Lyla and the stoic Bhela, when the family had its political disturbance, were looking forward to playing around to their heart’s content.</p>\n<p>Granny Litha came with a walking stick she always had with her whenever she went outside Malikh Family’s area. “You two ran away just so that you can make satays outdoor? Back when I was your age, girls were all very obedient staying at home learning how to weave our own dress and make sambals all day! Only smelly boys get dirty gathering ride field conches and hunting for wild goats!”</p>\n<p>Lyla, however, who never had the experience of living as a real local girl, disagreed. “What? Why would I share my satays with smelly boys? That would never happen!”</p>\n<p>“Hmph! You city girl, how entitled!”</p>\n<p>Bhela ruffled Lyla’s hair and said, “Lyla, isn’t there something you want to ask Granny Litha?”</p>\n<p>“So, you want to ask me something?” Granny Litha looked at the bamboo basket holding girl.</p>\n<p>“Yes,” Lyla said, her face became serious as she asked, “How exactly grass taste like?”</p>\n<p>“No, that wasn’t what you want to ask Granny Litha, wasn’t it?” Bhela ruffled Lyla’s hair harder. She then asked it instead on the naughty’s girl behalf. “We want to know whether it’s okay to visit One Tulip Restaurant this evening.”</p>\n<p>“Why do you need my permission for this? Aren’t you two naughty lasses the one who made this old granny has to venture outside the village to deal with the mess that incompetent folks left behind?”</p>\n<p>Lyla blinked her eyes, honestly didn’t know what Granny Litha was talking about.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Bhela continued patting Lyla’s head, pretending she didn’t know what Granny Litha was talking about.</p>\n<p>“Hmph!” Granny Litha snorted. “You think your parents would let you girls travelling around after dark without family’s supervision?”</p>\n<p>“Don’t worry,” Bhela said, “someone I know in Elzhier Family said Elder Shyla had some business to attend in the same city tonight. So I merely asked for a ride and they let us come with them.”</p>\n<p>Some folks in Badril Village still superstitious and looked down on girls who liked to go out at night. But Bhela didn’t care. Lyla wanted to visit One Tulip Restaurant after knowing delicious food there. Therefore, as the Young Lady of Bhela Malikh, she had to accommodate this glutton to taste Malikh Family’s most prized dishes at their fullest potential, as this might be their last chance to play to their heart’s content before Butler Tim really did restrict Lyla’s movement.</p>\n<p>And with that, Bhela and Lyla let the aunties and Granny Litha enter the carriage, setting them off on the mouth of Badril Village.</p>\n<p>“Don’t forget to prepare me beef satays tonight for freeeee~~” Lyla yelled as she waved her hand. The water-buffalo carriage Granny Litha and others were slowly drifted away from Badril Village, yet, the girl still happily waving her hand while yelling a bunch of food that she wanted to eat.</p>\n<p>Granny Litha snorted. “That lass comes from a rich noble family, yet she still dares to ask this old woman beef satay for free?”</p>\n<p>Such an air headed girl! Granny Litha had lived for eighty years, yet never she met a girl like Lyla Blackwood!</p>\n<p>The old woman couldn’t take her eyes off the girls. Bhela seemed to be saying something to Lyla, ruffling her head out of habit. This young lady of fifteen’s face was too far away for Granny Litha to notice her expression--yet, somehow, she could see the vivid image of a girl pampering her friend like she was her own sister.</p>\n<p>“Back when I was their age--”</p>\n<p>Back when Granny Litha was at their age, she never had the impudence to mess around like them. She was always fond of her study and practicing her craft to be a disciple worthy of Matriarch Malikh. And she always felt content with her life. Once a while, whenever she did a good job, a beautiful woman would ruffle her hair. This beautiful woman almost had never smiled nor she ever gave people praise, a coldness and stoic that fit with her icy beauty, giving chill those who didn’t know her well--yet, in reality, very warm to those who close with her.</p>\n<p>Remembering her beauty made Granny Litha thinking about that young lady of hers who made her travel outside the village to manage One Tulip Restaurant that she already gave up decades ago.</p>\n<p>“But I thought you’ll never care about One Tulip Restaurant again unless Matriarch Malikh personally comes to ask you to.”</p>\n<p>Grand Elder Malikh said that.</p>\n<p>A soft sigh escaped Granny Litha’s dry lips. She shook her head and tried to watch scenery as the carriage slowly traversed the grassy road ahead.</p>\n<p>“I will return, Litha. In the meantime, please continue making sambal and prove yourself worthy in inheriting my One Tulip Restaurant.”</p>\n<p>Under a stormy night sometimes in the past, the beautiful woman pulled her hood again after she said her farewell. Litha Malikh was one of the people she visited before she went following a man’s step, just a night before the news of Matriarch Malikh’s sudden retirement and the rumor of her eloping with an unknown man made a big wave in Badril Village. Even after all these seventy years, Granny Litha would never forget that beautiful face whose iciness hid a very warm soul that she always looked up to.</p>\n<p>Sighing once again, Granny Litha accidentally uttered her train of thought, “Young Lady Bhela is fifteen this year, isn’t she?”</p>\n<p>“Huh?” Aunty Yaya who sat beside her woke up from her nap. “She is.”</p>\n<p>“She looks quite like Matriarch Malikh when she was at her age,” Granny Litha said.</p>\n<p>“Is she?”</p>\n<p>Not only their beauty the same, even their temperament, preference of doing things, and their boldness to disregard the old custom--all the resemblance between them were strikingly uncanny. If only not for Bhela’s short bob hair cut, Granny Litha really thought Matriarch Malikh really did return to Malikh Family after all these seventy long years.</p>\n<hr>\n","unregistered":[]}}
