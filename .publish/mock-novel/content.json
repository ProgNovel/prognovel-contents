{"volume-1/chapter-1-5":"<p>A fifteen years old boy played a game of chess against a spirit. Yesterday, he won a ghastly old encyclopedia nobody ever heard of. Today, the bet he eyed was silver coins. He didn’t know what he wanted from his opponent for tomorrow’s game. But the spirit in this dashing leather armor, adventurer-style, always wanted one thing for the game’s prize: taking control of the boy’s mortal body.</p>\n<p>More than a hundred games of chess later, the boy still got his healthy body intact, he never lost even once. And that made the spirit grow more dissatisfied as the days passing by.</p>\n<p>“Holy ff--! I clearly remember this damn bishop wasn’t there,” the spirit said. From the look of it, he was two moves away from getting his king owned.</p>\n<p>The boy clicked his tongue. He was hearing that kind of excuse every time the chess game came to its end.</p>\n<p>The spirit stubbornly closed the gap in his defense by sacrificing a rook. But soon, without taking a time to think, the boy casually moved his one horse, eating away the queen, sealing all the chance for the spirit to counter-attack.</p>\n<p>“Fuck this shit!!!”</p>\n<p>Enraged, the spirit flipped the chess board. About a dozen chess pieces hurled all side as they became the victims of the spirit’s frustration. The boy sighed. This was no good. Apparently he needed to be more considerate for the next game. He needed to pretend struggling before he crushed this impatient spirit so he didn’t feel cornered and ended up abandoning all these easy-money making games.</p>\n<p>“Hey,” the boy said. He tapped the flat-surfaced stone they used to lay the chess board before and reminded the spirit, almost as if he was saying “put the money here.”</p>\n<p>As annoyed as he was, the spirit could do nothing but give him a pouch of coins.</p>\n<p>“They are not kobes,” the boy said. “Shops and stalls in the village only accept kobe coins.”</p>\n<p>The spirit scoffed.</p>\n<p>“What do you know about it, brat. If you convert with the last week rate then you’ve got twice the shitty kobe you extort from me. Be glad about it.”</p>\n<p>“This won’t do, Ol’ Nalaq. The peddlers that come around here rarely accept strange currency. Neighbor country’s money is usually fine but I don’t think these coins would do. I don’t even know which country these coins are from.”</p>\n<p>“Then use it to add your savings,” the spirit said. “And don’t call me Nalaq. Don’t push your primitive tribal nonsense to me. Call me ‘Good-Natured Spirit’ as usual. I’m not like your usual Nalaqs, brat.”</p>\n<p>“It’s not tribal.” The boy didn’t show any sign of agreement. He didn’t know why this roguish-grinning spirit didn’t like to be called a Nalaq. The way southern Mossack people, like the boy himself, addressed spirits were usually by two terms: Nalaq and Selaq. As far as he knew Nalaq was a title worth to be proud of.</p>\n<novel-trivia label=”Lore”>\n<p>Nalaq were those of the spirit of fallen heroes and mages, had attained high-level of enlightenment to see ways to preserve souls across death. Whilst no longer to be alive, Nalaqs own their consciousness and retain their memories as well intelligence, though part of their original power diminished, especially those who relied on physical might during their prime.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Selaqs arose from death through unnatural causes, sometimes fueled by resentment and great energy of negativity. Though more powerful, their spirit didn’t dissipate because of strong, usually vile, emotions their harbour when they died, the restless spirits stuck in the limbo and returned back to the mortal world as hostile, mindless haunting spectres.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>Theoretically the spirit that currently playing chess was a Nalaq. He still got his consciousness, true. But, in a way, his intelligence seemed way apart from the Nalaqs southern Mossack tribes often revered in the past--that was what the boy had in mind when looking at this vulgar grinning spirit.</p>\n<p>“You’re not thinking something stupid about me, are you?” the spirit said with a snort as he realized the unexcited eyes the boy had as if he was looking at cow dung.</p>\n<p>“No, I was thinking just the usual--I was wondering about your very existence and your real identity.”</p>\n<p>“That so?” the spirit raised his chin. “Don’t need overthinking it, boy. Hehe. If you know even a piece of my name then you’d be amazed by how amazing I am. Everybody is my bitch when I’m still your age back then, hehe. That’s true.”</p>\n<p>“Hooohhh…” the boy half-heartedly nodded. As expected, every time he brought the topic about the spirit’s identity, all he got was empty talks, disgusting enough for him to regret for bringing up the topic. For now, the only joyous thing he got to do was counting the money he won from the chess game as the bullshit Good-Natured Spirit sang about his past tuning endlessly in the background.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Somewhere in Tiramikal Continent, far in the opposite side of the cold, barbaric northern lands, not too isolated from the bustling early-capitalistic empires of the western lands, and not too far away from the neighbor eastern lands of never-ending warfares between the eastern Kaya feudal lords, a village known as Badril Village was living peaceful for a number of years. The old blood the locals knew as Badril Village’s three big families rooted deeply these past one hundred years in spite of the thinning southern Mossack heritage. Despite slowly developing their rural village worthy of the westerner tourists and easterners refugees, the southern locals still taking pride in their Mossack hunters and gatherers ancestry. Exactly one year ago Good-Natured Spirit appeared in this humble village.󠆞</p>\n<p>On the wall of Yashura Family’s courtyard, which was ridiculously thick and tall for ordinary villages, the spirit took out a rolled paper of dried tobacco. This might not be common knowledge known only to limited people; for converting earthly materials to spiritual goods for Nalaqs to use, it could only be done in an expensive and complicated manner--usually performed in rituals by the royalties and great ancient clans for annual offerings to their ancestors. But the spirit in shabby leather armor did the converting for cigarettes and other trivial goods. Nobody knew how he did it. Even if they did, it’d be very hard to judge whether his quirk was worth to be admired or to be ridiculed at. Nevertheless he got this kind of air around him that telling people he didn’t care much about what they think.</p>\n<p>The street below the wall were children below ages of ten playing with sticks and chasing each other. When a crowd of housewives came, his eyes, sharp as an eagle’s, sweeping through in search of prey. One of his habit that obviously he brought with him since he was alive was to oogle women, especially for young wives and pretty middle-aged aunties interesting big breasts and interesting big butts. Despite his sighing and occasional annoying tongue-clicking, though, those wives and children didn’t turn their heads toward him. They didn’t even know a lecher ghost was there haunting the street. A Nalaq couldn’t be seen by common folks by default. Unless he wanted to, no one would realize there was a suspicious spirit ogling for women that were passing by.</p>\n<p>There was a young woman he knew trotted the street. Good-Natured Spirit knew her. She was neither a wife nor she was an aunty. Her butt and breasts sizes were also not worth being fusing about. The name was Mila Yashura, seventeen years old since last month. She was the older cousin of the boy he lost playing chess to.</p>\n<p>“Aunty,” Mila greeted an aunty by lowering her head, “did you see my cousin Shira around here?”</p>\n<p>The local wife she asked shook her head. Mila Yashura said a polite thanks and continued searching for her cousin.</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit swept the street with his eyes, looking for something. When he saw a certain manservant he stopped. Using his spiritual knife, he dismantled a small pebble from the stone wall he sat on, flicked it using his thumb and knocked the manservant’s head with it.</p>\n<p>“Ouch!” the manservant cried.</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura abruptly turned her head and saw a manservant of her Yashura Family holding his head. She briskly coming to him and asked the same question she threw to the aunty before.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira?” the manservant glanced at the direction of the hill behind Yashura Family’s wall. “I saw him walking there at noon. But whether he has returned or not I don’t know.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you. That’s good enough. Here, treat yourself some coffee beans before the peddlers set for the next village.”</p>\n<p>The hill behind the Yashura Family’s dwelling was originally a place where the family members brought the family’s goats to graze its green grasses. But under the current patriarch’s management, the family’s fortunate mostly put on investing on coconut plantations, thus some grazing places were left unused.</p>\n<p>“Shira! So here’s you holing yourself. I’ve been searching you for nearly an hour,” Mila saw how her cousin who was two years younger than her enjoying himself lying under a shadowy tree, using his arms as pillows. She kicked his foot, yelling him to get up, but Shira merely changed his position and groaned in protest.</p>\n<p>“This buffon…” Mila hissed. “You know how the fact you’re lazing around everyday breeds all those crappy rumors, don’t you?”</p>\n<p>“People can talk whatever they want as long as they don’t bother me,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“But they bother our family!”</p>\n<p>Mila inhaling a deep breath. Now her voice getting higher annoyingly and she continued, “You’re the young master of our family, you lazy pig. The nearest in-line to inherit the patriarch title! You may don’t give a shit about your reputation now but if you are to take the leader's mantle from my father then all the crap they said would certainly bite your ass in the future! You hear?!”</p>\n<p>Shira picked his ear coolly. He might not know anything about the future, but certainly his cousin’s annoying nagging was biting his ass at this moment.</p>\n<p>“What are you doing alone in this kind of place anyway?”</p>\n<p>“You might not believe it, but I’m making a fortune here,” Shira said. Of course, whenever he played a game of chess with a spirit invisible to ordinary humans, he needed a quiet place where nobody was around. This was a perfect place for him.</p>\n<p>But Mila winced her eyes. A few seconds later, she turned her head, catching a canvas filled with rough sketches resting on the tree.</p>\n<p>“By painting?”</p>\n<p>“Sometimes that too.” Shira knew a bit about drawing scenery and people, so even with his limited interpersonal connection as an introvert he could make some money with his painting. However, his casual reply got Mila in a bad mood instead. Suddenly Shira remembered the embarrassing accident two months ago when Mila found an unfinished commision from a certain good-for-nothing spirit that he had carefully hidden in his house. When people commissioned a no-name painter they mostly asked for a portrait or image they deemed interesting. What kind of images Good-Natured Spirit found interesting? Women, of course. Especially those with big butts and big breasts. He liked them in thin, slipping clothings as if those vulnerable ladies were stuck in a very dangerous situation. In other words, erotic paintings.</p>\n<p>Then, sighing at the explosive nagging coming his way, Shira took a stick he slipped on his right ear and presented it as a bribe. Ancient southern Mossacks used berries and some used squid inks as pigments, but after waves of outside influence they started using quills and brushes, depending on the regions. Pencils, although practical, were introduced by a certain Nalaq spirit and Shira hadn’t heard anyone using it beside himself. The stick he used as a bribe was exactly a pencil. It sharpened many times and half-way on its way before he needed another one. Shira thought, maybe he should extort some more pencils for the next match from Good-Natured Spirit.</p>\n<p>Mila furrowed. She knew about the pencil and its value not too long ago thus, as expected, she grabbed it shamelessly. “What? Do you think you can escape only with this?”</p>\n<p>“I planned to give you something else but I think you’d rather like this simple bribe anyway.”</p>\n<p>Shira wanted to simply give her money to make her shut up. But the coins he had on him now only in form of foreign currency--the coins he extorted from Good-Natured Spirit from the last chess game. The boy frowned. Beside nagging him at full force, what did Mila coming here for?</p>\n<p>“Yeah, that reminds me, the news I wanted to tell you!” Mila finally snapped out of her nagging mode. “That Malikh girl! Your fiancée! After two years abroad! She’s finally coming home!”</p>\n<p>“Ohh…” the reply was anticlimactic.</p>\n<p>“Ohh? What the fuck with that reply?”</p>\n<p>“You don’t mind me. I just already burn out when people compare me with her,” Shira said. Although their age were the same, this young lady of Malikh Family was famous even in the nearby villages and town as a talent, with a promising look that might make her a beauty worth dying for. The old generations called her treasure and the boys loved her as the village princess. She went abroad two years ago for a series of seminars after an official from the capital scouted her talent. Now that she returned, everybody was fervently talking about her. But for Shira Yashura, the boy who was supposed to be the fiancé, even that kind of news wasn’t enough to make him get up from his comfortable napping.</p>\n<p>“My father wants to talk with you,” Mila said, “get up now.”</p>\n<p>“What about?”</p>\n<p>“You still asking?”</p>\n<p>The boy had a premonition that a troublesome matter would be waiting for him. Mila gave him an ultimatum before she wandered off to do her own things.</p>\n<p>“Hehe, what’s this fiancée I heard just now?” Good-Natured Spirit popped out his head from a tree beside Shira.</p>\n<p>“It’s not what you think,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“Oh yeah?” Good-Natured Spirit nudged the boy with his elbow. “I heard that chick is a hella beauty. Hehe, I bet her luggages is in good-quality, you know what I mean?”</p>\n<p>“From whom did you hear that?”</p>\n<p>“Doesn’t matter who. When it comes to chick my radar is very sensitive, eh. I’m curious. Did you benefit from this engagement thingy? Benefit, know what I mean?”</p>\n<p>Shira clicked his tongue. “Like I said, it’s not what you think it is. Our parents set us up and it’s been a mess since the talks about engagement got out.”</p>\n<p>Talking some sense to this good-for-nothing Nalaq was futile. Good-Natured Spirit kept teasing him. “You haven’t seen her for two years, have you? The talks I’ve been hearing down there real hairy, brat. I mean… especially those luggages of hers, know what I mean? Know what I mean? Nudge nudge. Nudge nudge,” he winked. “Wanna check on her?”</p>\n<p>“I need to go back. My uncle wants to talk with me.”</p>\n<p>“Alright then,” Good-Natured Spirit nodded as he rubbed his chin. “I’ll check the chick myself.”</p>\n<p>Carrying the canvas and the chess with him, Shira warned the Nalaq, “You better not do anything funny to her, hear me?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho. Jealous?”</p>\n<p>“I just don’t want their entire family coming right after me with pitchforks just because yo do something stupid.”</p>\n<p>After he said that Shira Yashura turned around. He started to walk down the hill. Good-Natured Spirit saw the boy walk without caring for the world, then he set off to check the girl by himself with a chuckle that escaped from his mouth.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A few hours later the said fiancée showed herself in a public training field. The field, owned by the most influential family in Badril Village--the Elzhier Family--was neatly arranged with archery targets and provided with dulled swords for the teenagers trained themselves or doing mock battles. The Elzhiers sent some menservants occasionally to act as security in case conflicts would occur. Today, the young master of the said family himself, nicknamed Bony, guarded the entrance along with two of his lackeys.</p>\n<p>“I’ve got to pay you to enter?!” a young man gawked at the sudden irregularity regarding the training field’s rules. “What’s this? The field is supposed to be free for everyone!”</p>\n<p>“Well, man, gotta pay for maintenance cost,” one of the lackeys, called Pilek, said as he rubbed his nose.</p>\n<p>“One silver kobe! Heh, maintenance cost my ass! Nobody would pay for this bullshit.”</p>\n<p>“Nobody? You wrong, man,” another lackey called Polio pointed at the crowd inside the training field with a gesture of his head. The girl from the Malikh Family causing a big ruckus from her arrival alone. She attracted boys like a bright lamp attracted fireflies. Because of that, the three deliquents in the entrance for nearly half an hour had been amassing quite a fortune till now.</p>\n<p>“I’ll definitely send complaints to Elzhier Family now. Just because your father is the village head you think you can do whatever you want, eh?” the young man snorted, sending a glare to them.</p>\n<p>The Elzhier Family’s young master, who had been watching with his back resting on the wall and his arms crossed, decided to open his mouth, he said, “Pay or get lost.”</p>\n<p>“Hear that? Boss Bony has spoken,” Pilek glared back at the young man with his head tilted. “Better get lost now or else…”</p>\n<p>“Or else!” Polio emphasized with a higher voice.</p>\n<p>The three of them had been infamous in the village despite being heirs to their respective families. Naturally, though they were the same age, only an idiot would butting head directly with the heir of Elzhier Family. Thus the young man snorted, unwillingly turned and walked away.</p>\n<p>“What the heck is that?” Pilek didn’t like the way that young man snorted at them. “We should teach bastards like him a few good lessons one of these days.”</p>\n<p>“You’re right,” Polio added.</p>\n<p>“Just ignore that bum,” Bony said.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, the next onlookers came. Not boys, but two girls to be exact. They carried bags of dirty clothes with them as they were on their way to wash the clothes at the river.</p>\n<p>“Well, I’d be damned,” one of the girls, a young lady named Romana, said, “I’ve been hearing about the rumors but looking at that Malikh girl, damn…. Look at how she did with her hair, Mila.”</p>\n<p>They could see what was happening in the field even from the entrance. The two girls looked at a certain girl who was surrounded by boys. The other girl, Mila Yashura, furrowed her brows at the current appearance of her cousin’s fiancée. She kept her mouth shut despite the anger on her eyes.</p>\n<p>“She cut her hair short despite being engaged to your cousin,” Romana said to Mila. “What’s that supposed to mean?”</p>\n<p>It was a custom of southern Mossack people for women to cut their hair short to tell the opposite sex they currently unavailable. Mostly widows who weren’t ready to be courted again chose to cut their hair that way. However, since the young lady of Malikh Family was currently engaged, the act of cutting her hair short was confusing to people.</p>\n<p>From the three delinquents who had been hearing their conversations, Pilek butted in, “Yo, ladies, don’t think too much about it. We southern people been foreigners with this fiancé-and-fiancée business. We practical people, y’know? Southerners the kind of people who would do it first then talking ‘bout marriage later. A chance she might not know what she was doing.”</p>\n<p>Romana rolled her eyes. Knowing Mila Yashura was here, she wished this stupid cheerful delinquent wouldn’t say what he had said. In fact, better for him to not open his mouth. She hated him whenever he opened his mouth and said pointless things.</p>\n<p>Her and Mila’s goal was to check about the rumor regarding the fiancée’s short hair. They didn’t have the intention to enter the training field and mingle with those crowdy horny boys, lest talking with these shameless thugs who clearly act as bandits.</p>\n<p>“Let’s go, Mila,” Romana whispered as she realized Mila had been glaring at the three delinquents. Moving her eyes from Mila, she looked at Bony who was in between his two lackeys. She whispered again, “you can’t fight him like you used to. He got a Knight class now. People said he can even fight another Knight with four level above him. Let’s just forget about it.”</p>\n<p>Last time Mila and Bony fought was three years ago. Her punch made his nose bleed but that was the end of it. It was a hot topic for a while and most didn’t know what happened but the long enmity between the two of them suddenly dropped cold and they had been avoiding each other. Seeing how the other party was quite well, Mila Yashura grimaced. They were Novices back then but now, after both of them ascended the first level barrier and got themselves class titles, there was no way a support-class Specialist like her could deliver that kind of punch again to his face.</p>\n<p>“Mm. Let’s go,” Mila said to Romana. No matter how brave and reckless she was, as a non-combatant talent, she knew better than to sow another discord with the village’s young generation’s strongest.</p>\n<p>Pilek, the most cheerful in Bony’s group, who was actually the most friendly, waved his hand to the girls as they walked away. Neither of them bothered with him.</p>\n<p>“Ahhh, my sister’s been avoiding me lately,” Pilek grumbled. Romana, Mila’s friend, was actually his half-sister from different mother. He was a proud big brother when they were young, until their mothers had a fight and his half-sister moved into a separate house.</p>\n<p>“Pilek,” Bony called.</p>\n<p>“Yes boss?”</p>\n<p>“You should’ve kept your mouth shut.”</p>\n<p>Pilek wryly smiled and nodded. Polio also thought his friend Pilek couldn’t read between the line. Although Pilek’s remark was well-intentioned, it’d just make things worse for Bony. The bad mood from back three years ago still left after taste that made him and her uncomfortable dealing with each other.</p>\n<p>After that, more people were coming to see the young lady of Malikh Family.</p>\n<p>The talks and speculations about her hair made the boys think she was dissatisfied with her engagement with Shira Yashura. Thus giving them hopes to snatch her away. It was no exaggeration to say that most of the boys fell for her, especially after they saw how the young lady grew beautifully. They surrounded this girl who had this icy expression on her face, though she herself greatly concentrated on holding a bow and an arrow, eyes straight to the archery target dozens of meters from her. She shot. And when the arrow hit splendidly, the boys would cheer and fawn all over her. The girl kept her face cold despite the flooding flattery coming at her way.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” a young man in his early twenty stepped forward from the bunch of admirers and confidently said, “I see you have this different aura about you. Something special that I can’t quite get my fingers on it, and I can’t help but feel curious about you.”</p>\n<p>That was supposed to be a pick-up line, but Bhela Malikh replied straightforwardly, “I changed. Now I’m Level 10 and not a Novice anymore.”</p>\n<p>“Oooohhhh!!” the crowd was surprised. Reaching the first barrier and got a class title at fifteen years old was the second time in these two decades. The first one was Bony. However, considering the girl was quite a talent enough for people in the capital to notice her, there was a high chance for her to snatch the crown as Badril Village’s young generation’s strongest from Bony sooner than everyone expected.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” the young man called for her attention again, despite his first attempt at hitting on her was an utter failure. “I see your beautiful sharp eyes and beautiful nimble hands and your beautiful pretty face. The class you’ve got must be… a beautiful <b>Archer</b>, right?”</p>\n<p>“I am an archer,” Bhela replied tight-lipped. Well, it was obvious when she picked a bow the first thing she arrived here.</p>\n<p>“Ah, a beautiful and talented Archer then! It’s a pity, though for such a fine beautiful flower like yourself to be thrown into a heap of cow dung…”</p>\n<p>The remark made Bhela Malikh raise her brows. She somehow could predict where the topic was going to be directed.</p>\n<p>“That stupid engagement is what I say! How could a diamond such as yourself be forced to marry a trash from Yashura Family?”</p>\n<p>He sighed like he pitied the harsh fate of the beauty. And though unlikeable as he was, the murmurs of the crowd seemingly agreed with him. At that point, someone said, “That’s true. Even my ten years old nephew is one Level above him. Such trash to become…”</p>\n<p>The words stopped, Bhela looked at the person who said that. “The one from Yashura Family--he’s still a Level 3 Novice?”</p>\n<p>It was someone else who replied to her question. “Ah, yes, he’s stuck and made no progress even since Young Lady Bhela went outside the village. Everyone calls him The Eternal Novice.”</p>\n<p>And this made her raised brows turned into a frown. Going by the crowd, for a Level 5 Novice by fifteen years old was already considered slow progress even by the standard of rural places like Badril Village. Mostly at that age the youngsters already reached Level 7, the diligent ones could reach Level 8 with hard work. Faster than that, not counting usage of an unreasonable amount of growth-hack potions--which most children from rich noble families did, could be considered a talent amongst the younger generation. However, to think of a boy one year before his own coming-of-age ceremony coming still stuck at such low-level talent, even though if he was the heir of Badril Village’s major families, people would still call him trash, even in public.</p>\n<p>“Ah, Young Lady Bhela! You don’t have to bother yourself with such eyesore trash. I know you’re troubled with the careless arrangement your father made, but if we put our mind to it, we can--”</p>\n<p>All was well until the young man put bad words about her father. Never did he expect that the girl would mercilessly retract her hand just before the tips of their fingers touched.</p>\n<p>“Please don’t pretend you were familiar with me,” that was what she said.</p>\n<p>The rain of snickers rang all around him. Despite him glaring left and right in an intimidating manner, there was no way for him to suppress the crowd from humiliating him further. At the time he realized the chance for him to court the Young Lady of Malikh Family, the sole daughter of the Malikh Family Patriarch, was pitifully close to nothing. Thus, in a moment of spontaneity, he thought of a scheme to save his face and sounded it with a flash of desperate smirk plastered on his face. He grabbed a bow and said, “I see Young Lady Bhela rather reserved toward us long friends after two years abroad. Hmm, yeah, this is a perfect chance, by the way. I’m an Archer too, see. So why not this senior teach you a thing or two? Seventy meters--perhaps a good learning experience for young lady, no?”</p>\n<p>The surrounding began chattering lively. It was obvious it was a challenge as Archers. And the young man’s smirk turned more and more confident at the girl’s unresponsiveness. No matter how much potential talent one had, time and experience playing a vital role in assessing one’s current performance whether she was Archer or Priest or Knight or other classes. Skills, abilities one acquired after reaching the first barrier and getting a new class title could only progress with constant tempering in battle and improved alongside one’s level. The young man was a Level 12 Archer. So theoretically, a Level 10 new Archer like Bhela Malikh would need a few more years before she could beat the opponent in a fair competition.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh was annoyed. She glared at the ones who were supposed to be guarding the field. But Bony and his lackeys were busy counting coins. For Bhela, the crowd were a bunch of stupid annoying busybodies who prevented her to train in peace. But for Bony and his lackeys the crowd was simply a bunch of gold mines.</p>\n<p>“Please watch closely how I do it, Young Lady Bhela. See my elbow? If you could do the same way I do it, I’m sure your archery skill would improve significantly.”</p>\n<p>No one really bothered with the ‘humble direction’ the young man spouted. Bhela didn’t spare him a glance. She looked straight to target seventy meters from where she was standing. Repressing his anger, the young man began to shoot three arrows one by one splendidly; the final one landed right in the center of the target that was marked in red dot.</p>\n<p>He was satisfied with the result. Glancing at the young lady, this young man wanted to utter more words to improve his image. However, right before he opened his mouth, he found Bhela already drew her arrow, released it, and it hit one arrow splendidly. Not just hitting the target, but an arrow the young man previously shot. The second was the same. And the final third arrow also hit the arrow on the red dot.</p>\n<p>What was that? She used a skill? The young man wanted to object but his tongue froze and his lips quivered. Did she use <b>Far Sight</b> skill that enhanced eye-sight a hundred of meters away? Did she use <b>Boost Accuracy</b>, the skill that was supposedly forbidden to be used in duel between Archers? To think of beating him, an Archer older than her and 2 Level right above her, in such a devastating manner… she must be cheating, right?</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” the defeated young man said weakly, “I didn’t use my mana between my shots.”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh nodded.</p>\n<p>“Neither was I.”</p>\n<p>With that, Bhela turned around and left the crowd of dumbfounded boys with steps full of grace. She approached the entrance, returned back the bow she used to the three delinquents who just let people mess with her training and said coldly, “If this is how the famous Young Master Elzhier manages his property, then there’s no need for me to come here again. Please excuse me.”</p>\n<p>Bony’s expression didn’t change much as he still crossed his arms and rested his back casually on the wall.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Pilek, the one received the returned bow from Bhela, waved his hand again and shouted, “Take care, princess!”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Because she couldn’t train her archery peacefully in public, Bhela returned back to Malikh Family and trained in her private training place.</p>\n<p>It was originally a backyard turned archery ground, made by Malikh Family Patriarch after knowing his daughter showed interest in archery. It was nothing fancy. It was spacious and good enough when she started with her first bow but now Bhela felt the place was lacking. At most, she had to live with the meager fifty meters range maximum. Therefore, the practice she had made a habit of had to wait.</p>\n<p>Therefore, Bhela Malikh decided to put her mind over something else than her usual practice instead.</p>\n<p>She drew a deep breath. A table was provided with dozens of arrows laid on top of it. Bhela picked four at the same time, nocked them on her bow string. She began to aim.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the air surrounding her changed. Her inexperience as a newly Novice-graduate showed by the obvious mana that leaked from the inside out. With naked eyes, her mana looked calm colorful haze that consisted of four bold colors, tangling and struggling with each other for dominance. Her eyelashes quivered. Channeling mana to cast a skill she yet had mastered felt like trying to stand on the raging sea waves while she herself was being a weak newborn.</p>\n<p><em>Whhhhuuuuushh--</em></p>\n<p><em>Shuuuhsh--</em></p>\n<p><em>Ssshhhuuuush--</em></p>\n<p><em>Wwhuuuussh!!</em></p>\n<p>The fastest arrow, coated with sparking yellow-colored mana, hit one of the targets at around forty meters range. But the others performed pitifully. The one infused with wet blue-colored mana didn’t even reach two-third of the desired range. The green-colored one, an arrow infused with mana that generated unstable wind trajectory flew far far away, as if it was getting swallowed by the sky, never to be seen again. The last one, the red-colored arrow, was horrifying. It hit the training ground fence instead the target. The bamboo fences suddenly set ablaze by raging flames as soon as the said arrow came into contact with them.</p>\n<p><em>Clap clap clap!</em></p>\n<p>Uninvited claps resounded across the training ground. On the wall Good-Natured Spirit clapping after watching a good spectacle. For getting hand claps from a Nalaq like him, naturally the level of talent Bhela showed just now was far beyond ordinary.</p>\n<p>“Thank you…” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>It appeared she knew beforehand the four-arrows skill she shot would make a mess. So she gathered the maidservants and made them extinguish the fences that started to burn into ashes. “Thank you, thank you for your hard work,” she said to a pair of maidservants who briskly went back and forth to kill the fire before its spread.</p>\n<p>“Ah! Young lady, what skill was that just now?” one of the maidservants gawked after the fire was extinguished.</p>\n<p>“That wasn’t just your ordinary Archer skill, was it?” added the other.</p>\n<p>Summoning a blazing fire just with an arrow and pure mana was unheard of. At least, the maidservants knew nobody in the village could do that.</p>\n<p>Bhela drank a glass of murky liquify herbs mixed with mint to cool down her manasphere. “It’s something I learned when I was away,” she said after putting down the glass on the tray her maid servants provided. She continued, “I still can’t master it, though.”</p>\n<p>She cast her eyes at the unharmed targets one by one. Shooting at forty meters range was still too much for her using four arrows at the same time. When the maidservants realized her difficulty, they encouraged her to simplify it and shoot one arrow at a time. However at their suggestion, Bhela shook her head. “It’s the requirement of this skill I’ve got to shoot four arrows,” she explained.</p>\n<p>The maidservants nodded at her words and apologized for their shallow suggestion.</p>\n<p>“Don’t mind that,” Bhela waved her hand. “There’s something I heard from people, by the way. Something about Young Master Yashura.”</p>\n<p>The two maidservants glanced at each other before one of them replied. “The rumor says… he holed up from the public’s view because he’s ashamed he can’t even become a Level 4 Novice.”</p>\n<p>“Are the Yashura Family elders still favoring him as the heir of Yashura Family Patriarch?”</p>\n<p>“We don’t know whether they still favor him or not. But Yashura Family always united in their standing. So unless the current Patriarch of Yashura Family has a son, the Young Master Shira Yashura will undoubtedly become the next patriarch.”</p>\n<p>“No rumors about the Yashura Family elders wavering then?”</p>\n<p>The maidservants shook their heads altogether.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela… apologize for giving you my shallow suggestion once again but…” one of the maidservants came near to Bhela and whispered, “With him as the heir, Yashura Family’s future will be bleak. Everyone in our family said your father’s bad condition is a bad omen for us mingling with those simple Yashuras. I’m very sorry if this sounds impudent--but you should’ve better cut ties with them before too late, young lady. Madam was too grieved by your father’s ill health to make decisions thus the only one who can save our Malikh Family is you.”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at the maidservant. The glint on her eyes changed.</p>\n<p>“There’s already a plan laid to help our Malikh Family,” that was all Bhela said. “You better not say something like that again. You lucky no one here beside me to hear you utter that kind of words.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you for your mercy, young lady! We are sorry for being impudent!”</p>\n<p>They decided to make it history with only the four of them who knew the previous conversation. The four of them; the young lady and two maid servants and one Nalaq spirit who came here uninvited.</p>\n<p>“It seems I just heard something I shouldn’t hear,” Good-Natured Spirit said while he rubbed his chin. He came here peeking. He didn’t have the intention to reveal himself while the girls below had a secret conversation ignorant of his presence.</p>\n<p>After that Bhela continued with light training. Good-Natured Spirit watched her doing simple shooting, she didn’t even use a slightest of her mana from then on. Yawning, Good-Natured Spirit stood up. Then he flew away from Malikh Family and began to look for some other interesting thing to sate his boredom.</p>\n<hr>\n<authors-note id=\"Radhy\">\n<p>Testing, testing.

Yesterday, he won a ghastly old encyclopedia nobody ever heard of. Today, the bet he eyed was silver coins. He didn’t know what he wanted from his opponent for tomorrow’s game. But the spirit in this dashing leather armor, adventurer-style, always wanted one thing for the game’s prize: taking control of the boy’s mortal body.</p>\n<p>More than a hundred games of chess later, the boy still got his healthy body intact, he never lost even once. And that made the spirit grow more dissatisfied as the days passing by.</p>\n<p>“Holy ff--! I clearly remember this damn bishop wasn’t there,” the spirit said. From the look of it, he was two moves away from getting his king owned.</p>\n<p>The boy clicked his tongue. He was hearing that kind of excuse every time the chess game came to its end.</p>\n<p>The spirit stubbornly closed the gap in his defense by sacrificing a rook. But soon, without taking a time to think, the boy casually moved his one horse, eating away the queen, sealing all the chance for the spirit to counter-attack.</p>\n<p>“Fuck this shit!!!”</p>\n<p>Enraged, the spirit flipped the chess board. About a dozen chess pieces hurled all side as they became the victims of the spirit’s frustration. The boy sighed. This was no good. Apparently he needed to be more considerate for the next game. He needed to pretend struggling before he crushed this impatient spirit so he didn’t feel cornered and ended up abandoning all these easy-money making games.</p>\n<p>“Hey,” the boy said. He tapped the flat-surfaced stone they used to lay the chess board before and reminded the spirit, almost as if he was saying “put the money here.”</p>\n<p>As annoyed as he was, the spirit could do nothing but give him a pouch of coins.</p>\n<p>“They are not kobes,” the boy said. “Shops and stalls in the village only accept kobe coins.”</p>\n<p>The spirit scoffed.</p>\n<p>“What do you know about it, brat. If you convert with the last week rate then you’ve got twice the shitty kobe you extort from me. Be glad about it.”</p>\n<p>“This won’t do, Ol’ Nalaq. The peddlers that come around here rarely accept strange currency. Neighbor country’s money is usually fine but I don’t think these coins would do. I don’t even know which country these coins are from.”</p>\n<p>“Then use it to add your savings,” the spirit said. “And don’t call me Nalaq. Don’t push your primitive tribal nonsense to me. Call me ‘Good-Natured Spirit’ as usual. I’m not like your usual Nalaqs, brat.”</p>\n<p>“It’s not tribal.” The boy didn’t show any sign of agreement. He didn’t know why this roguish-grinning spirit didn’t like to be called a Nalaq. The way southern Mossack people, like the boy himself, addressed spirits were usually by two terms: Nalaq and Selaq. As far as he knew Nalaq was a title worth to be proud of.</p>\n<novel-trivia label=”Lore”>\n<p>Nalaq were those of the spirit of fallen heroes and mages, had attained high-level of enlightenment to see ways to preserve souls across death. Whilst no longer to be alive, Nalaqs own their consciousness and retain their memories as well intelligence, though part of their original power diminished, especially those who relied on physical might during their prime.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Selaqs arose from death through unnatural causes, sometimes fueled by resentment and great energy of negativity. Though more powerful, their spirit didn’t dissipate because of strong, usually vile, emotions their harbour when they died, the restless spirits stuck in the limbo and returned back to the mortal world as hostile, mindless haunting spectres.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>Theoretically the spirit that currently playing chess was a Nalaq. He still got his consciousness, true. But, in a way, his intelligence seemed way apart from the Nalaqs southern Mossack tribes often revered in the past--that was what the boy had in mind when looking at this vulgar grinning spirit.</p>\n<p>“You’re not thinking something stupid about me, are you?” the spirit said with a snort as he realized the unexcited eyes the boy had as if he was looking at cow dung.</p>\n<p>“No, I was thinking just the usual--I was wondering about your very existence and your real identity.”</p>\n<p>“That so?” the spirit raised his chin. “Don’t need overthinking it, boy. Hehe. If you know even a piece of my name then you’d be amazed by how amazing I am. Everybody is my bitch when I’m still your age back then, hehe. That’s true.”</p>\n<p>“Hooohhh…” the boy half-heartedly nodded. As expected, every time he brought the topic about the spirit’s identity, all he got was empty talks, disgusting enough for him to regret for bringing up the topic. For now, the only joyous thing he got to do was counting the money he won from the chess game as the bullshit Good-Natured Spirit sang about his past tuning endlessly in the background.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Somewhere in Tiramikal Continent, far in the opposite side of the cold, barbaric northern lands, not too isolated from the bustling early-capitalistic empires of the western lands, and not too far away from the neighbor eastern lands of never-ending warfares between the eastern Kaya feudal lords, a village known as Badril Village was living peaceful for a number of years. The old blood the locals knew as Badril Village’s three big families rooted deeply these past one hundred years in spite of the thinning southern Mossack heritage. Despite slowly developing their rural village worthy of the westerner tourists and easterners refugees, the southern locals still taking pride in their Mossack hunters and gatherers ancestry. Exactly one year ago Good-Natured Spirit appeared in this humble village.󠆞</p>\n<p>On the wall of Yashura Family’s courtyard, which was ridiculously thick and tall for ordinary villages, the spirit took out a rolled paper of dried tobacco. This might not be common knowledge known only to limited people; for converting earthly materials to spiritual goods for Nalaqs to use, it could only be done in an expensive and complicated manner--usually performed in rituals by the royalties and great ancient clans for annual offerings to their ancestors. But the spirit in shabby leather armor did the converting for cigarettes and other trivial goods. Nobody knew how he did it. Even if they did, it’d be very hard to judge whether his quirk was worth to be admired or to be ridiculed at. Nevertheless he got this kind of air around him that telling people he didn’t care much about what they think.</p>\n<p>The street below the wall were children below ages of ten playing with sticks and chasing each other. When a crowd of housewives came, his eyes, sharp as an eagle’s, sweeping through in search of prey. One of his habit that obviously he brought with him since he was alive was to oogle women, especially for young wives and pretty middle-aged aunties interesting big breasts and interesting big butts. Despite his sighing and occasional annoying tongue-clicking, though, those wives and children didn’t turn their heads toward him. They didn’t even know a lecher ghost was there haunting the street. A Nalaq couldn’t be seen by common folks by default. Unless he wanted to, no one would realize there was a suspicious spirit ogling for women that were passing by.</p>\n<p>There was a young woman he knew trotted the street. Good-Natured Spirit knew her. She was neither a wife nor she was an aunty. Her butt and breasts sizes were also not worth being fusing about. The name was Mila Yashura, seventeen years old since last month. She was the older cousin of the boy he lost playing chess to.</p>\n<p>“Aunty,” Mila greeted an aunty by lowering her head, “did you see my cousin Shira around here?”</p>\n<p>The local wife she asked shook her head. Mila Yashura said a polite thanks and continued searching for her cousin.</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit swept the street with his eyes, looking for something. When he saw a certain manservant he stopped. Using his spiritual knife, he dismantled a small pebble from the stone wall he sat on, flicked it using his thumb and knocked the manservant’s head with it.</p>\n<p>“Ouch!” the manservant cried.</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura abruptly turned her head and saw a manservant of her Yashura Family holding his head. She briskly coming to him and asked the same question she threw to the aunty before.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira?” the manservant glanced at the direction of the hill behind Yashura Family’s wall. “I saw him walking there at noon. But whether he has returned or not I don’t know.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you. That’s good enough. Here, treat yourself some coffee beans before the peddlers set for the next village.”</p>\n<p>The hill behind the Yashura Family’s dwelling was originally a place where the family members brought the family’s goats to graze its green grasses. But under the current patriarch’s management, the family’s fortunate mostly put on investing on coconut plantations, thus some grazing places were left unused.</p>\n<p>“Shira! So here’s you holing yourself. I’ve been searching you for nearly an hour,” Mila saw how her cousin who was two years younger than her enjoying himself lying under a shadowy tree, using his arms as pillows. She kicked his foot, yelling him to get up, but Shira merely changed his position and groaned in protest.</p>\n<p>“This buffon…” Mila hissed. “You know how the fact you’re lazing around everyday breeds all those crappy rumors, don’t you?”</p>\n<p>“People can talk whatever they want as long as they don’t bother me,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“But they bother our family!”</p>\n<p>Mila inhaling a deep breath. Now her voice getting higher annoyingly and she continued, “You’re the young master of our family, you lazy pig. The nearest in-line to inherit the patriarch title! You may don’t give a shit about your reputation now but if you are to take the leader's mantle from my father then all the crap they said would certainly bite your ass in the future! You hear?!”</p>\n<p>Shira picked his ear coolly. He might not know anything about the future, but certainly his cousin’s annoying nagging was biting his ass at this moment.</p>\n<p>“What are you doing alone in this kind of place anyway?”</p>\n<p>“You might not believe it, but I’m making a fortune here,” Shira said. Of course, whenever he played a game of chess with a spirit invisible to ordinary humans, he needed a quiet place where nobody was around. This was a perfect place for him.</p>\n<p>But Mila winced her eyes. A few seconds later, she turned her head, catching a canvas filled with rough sketches resting on the tree.</p>\n<p>“By painting?”</p>\n<p>“Sometimes that too.” Shira knew a bit about drawing scenery and people, so even with his limited interpersonal connection as an introvert he could make some money with his painting. However, his casual reply got Mila in a bad mood instead. Suddenly Shira remembered the embarrassing accident two months ago when Mila found an unfinished commision from a certain good-for-nothing spirit that he had carefully hidden in his house. When people commissioned a no-name painter they mostly asked for a portrait or image they deemed interesting. What kind of images Good-Natured Spirit found interesting? Women, of course. Especially those with big butts and big breasts. He liked them in thin, slipping clothings as if those vulnerable ladies were stuck in a very dangerous situation. In other words, erotic paintings.</p>\n<p>Then, sighing at the explosive nagging coming his way, Shira took a stick he slipped on his right ear and presented it as a bribe. Ancient southern Mossacks used berries and some used squid inks as pigments, but after waves of outside influence they started using quills and brushes, depending on the regions. Pencils, although practical, were introduced by a certain Nalaq spirit and Shira hadn’t heard anyone using it beside himself. The stick he used as a bribe was exactly a pencil. It sharpened many times and half-way on its way before he needed another one. Shira thought, maybe he should extort some more pencils for the next match from Good-Natured Spirit.</p>\n<p>Mila furrowed. She knew about the pencil and its value not too long ago thus, as expected, she grabbed it shamelessly. “What? Do you think you can escape only with this?”</p>\n<p>“I planned to give you something else but I think you’d rather like this simple bribe anyway.”</p>\n<p>Shira wanted to simply give her money to make her shut up. But the coins he had on him now only in form of foreign currency--the coins he extorted from Good-Natured Spirit from the last chess game. The boy frowned. Beside nagging him at full force, what did Mila coming here for?</p>\n<p>“Yeah, that reminds me, the news I wanted to tell you!” Mila finally snapped out of her nagging mode. “That Malikh girl! Your fiancée! After two years abroad! She’s finally coming home!”</p>\n<p>“Ohh…” the reply was anticlimactic.</p>\n<p>“Ohh? What the fuck with that reply?”</p>\n<p>“You don’t mind me. I just already burn out when people compare me with her,” Shira said. Although their age were the same, this young lady of Malikh Family was famous even in the nearby villages and town as a talent, with a promising look that might make her a beauty worth dying for. The old generations called her treasure and the boys loved her as the village princess. She went abroad two years ago for a series of seminars after an official from the capital scouted her talent. Now that she returned, everybody was fervently talking about her. But for Shira Yashura, the boy who was supposed to be the fiancé, even that kind of news wasn’t enough to make him get up from his comfortable napping.</p>\n<p>“My father wants to talk with you,” Mila said, “get up now.”</p>\n<p>“What about?”</p>\n<p>“You still asking?”</p>\n<p>The boy had a premonition that a troublesome matter would be waiting for him. Mila gave him an ultimatum before she wandered off to do her own things.</p>\n<p>“Hehe, what’s this fiancée I heard just now?” Good-Natured Spirit popped out his head from a tree beside Shira.</p>\n<p>“It’s not what you think,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“Oh yeah?” Good-Natured Spirit nudged the boy with his elbow. “I heard that chick is a hella beauty. Hehe, I bet her luggages is in good-quality, you know what I mean?”</p>\n<p>“From whom did you hear that?”</p>\n<p>“Doesn’t matter who. When it comes to chick my radar is very sensitive, eh. I’m curious. Did you benefit from this engagement thingy? Benefit, know what I mean?”</p>\n<p>Shira clicked his tongue. “Like I said, it’s not what you think it is. Our parents set us up and it’s been a mess since the talks about engagement got out.”</p>\n<p>Talking some sense to this good-for-nothing Nalaq was futile. Good-Natured Spirit kept teasing him. “You haven’t seen her for two years, have you? The talks I’ve been hearing down there real hairy, brat. I mean… especially those luggages of hers, know what I mean? Know what I mean? Nudge nudge. Nudge nudge,” he winked. “Wanna check on her?”</p>\n<p>“I need to go back. My uncle wants to talk with me.”</p>\n<p>“Alright then,” Good-Natured Spirit nodded as he rubbed his chin. “I’ll check the chick myself.”</p>\n<p>Carrying the canvas and the chess with him, Shira warned the Nalaq, “You better not do anything funny to her, hear me?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho. Jealous?”</p>\n<p>“I just don’t want their entire family coming right after me with pitchforks just because yo do something stupid.”</p>\n<p>After he said that Shira Yashura turned around. He started to walk down the hill. Good-Natured Spirit saw the boy walk without caring for the world, then he set off to check the girl by himself with a chuckle that escaped from his mouth.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A few hours later the said fiancée showed herself in a public training field. The field, owned by the most influential family in Badril Village--the Elzhier Family--was neatly arranged with archery targets and provided with dulled swords for the teenagers trained themselves or doing mock battles. The Elzhiers sent some menservants occasionally to act as security in case conflicts would occur. Today, the young master of the said family himself, nicknamed Bony, guarded the entrance along with two of his lackeys.</p>\n<p>“I’ve got to pay you to enter?!” a young man gawked at the sudden irregularity regarding the training field’s rules. “What’s this? The field is supposed to be free for everyone!”</p>\n<p>“Well, man, gotta pay for maintenance cost,” one of the lackeys, called Pilek, said as he rubbed his nose.</p>\n<p>“One silver kobe! Heh, maintenance cost my ass! Nobody would pay for this bullshit.”</p>\n<p>“Nobody? You wrong, man,” another lackey called Polio pointed at the crowd inside the training field with a gesture of his head. The girl from the Malikh Family causing a big ruckus from her arrival alone. She attracted boys like a bright lamp attracted fireflies. Because of that, the three deliquents in the entrance for nearly half an hour had been amassing quite a fortune till now.</p>\n<p>“I’ll definitely send complaints to Elzhier Family now. Just because your father is the village head you think you can do whatever you want, eh?” the young man snorted, sending a glare to them.</p>\n<p>The Elzhier Family’s young master, who had been watching with his back resting on the wall and his arms crossed, decided to open his mouth, he said, “Pay or get lost.”</p>\n<p>“Hear that? Boss Bony has spoken,” Pilek glared back at the young man with his head tilted. “Better get lost now or else…”</p>\n<p>“Or else!” Polio emphasized with a higher voice.</p>\n<p>The three of them had been infamous in the village despite being heirs to their respective families. Naturally, though they were the same age, only an idiot would butting head directly with the heir of Elzhier Family. Thus the young man snorted, unwillingly turned and walked away.</p>\n<p>“What the heck is that?” Pilek didn’t like the way that young man snorted at them. “We should teach bastards like him a few good lessons one of these days.”</p>\n<p>“You’re right,” Polio added.</p>\n<p>“Just ignore that bum,” Bony said.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, the next onlookers came. Not boys, but two girls to be exact. They carried bags of dirty clothes with them as they were on their way to wash the clothes at the river.</p>\n<p>“Well, I’d be damned,” one of the girls, a young lady named Romana, said, “I’ve been hearing about the rumors but looking at that Malikh girl, damn…. Look at how she did with her hair, Mila.”</p>\n<p>They could see what was happening in the field even from the entrance. The two girls looked at a certain girl who was surrounded by boys. The other girl, Mila Yashura, furrowed her brows at the current appearance of her cousin’s fiancée. She kept her mouth shut despite the anger on her eyes.</p>\n<p>“She cut her hair short despite being engaged to your cousin,” Romana said to Mila. “What’s that supposed to mean?”</p>\n<p>It was a custom of southern Mossack people for women to cut their hair short to tell the opposite sex they currently unavailable. Mostly widows who weren’t ready to be courted again chose to cut their hair that way. However, since the young lady of Malikh Family was currently engaged, the act of cutting her hair short was confusing to people.</p>\n<p>From the three delinquents who had been hearing their conversations, Pilek butted in, “Yo, ladies, don’t think too much about it. We southern people been foreigners with this fiancé-and-fiancée business. We practical people, y’know? Southerners the kind of people who would do it first then talking ‘bout marriage later. A chance she might not know what she was doing.”</p>\n<p>Romana rolled her eyes. Knowing Mila Yashura was here, she wished this stupid cheerful delinquent wouldn’t say what he had said. In fact, better for him to not open his mouth. She hated him whenever he opened his mouth and said pointless things.</p>\n<p>Her and Mila’s goal was to check about the rumor regarding the fiancée’s short hair. They didn’t have the intention to enter the training field and mingle with those crowdy horny boys, lest talking with these shameless thugs who clearly act as bandits.</p>\n<p>“Let’s go, Mila,” Romana whispered as she realized Mila had been glaring at the three delinquents. Moving her eyes from Mila, she looked at Bony who was in between his two lackeys. She whispered again, “you can’t fight him like you used to. He got a Knight class now. People said he can even fight another Knight with four level above him. Let’s just forget about it.”</p>\n<p>Last time Mila and Bony fought was three years ago. Her punch made his nose bleed but that was the end of it. It was a hot topic for a while and most didn’t know what happened but the long enmity between the two of them suddenly dropped cold and they had been avoiding each other. Seeing how the other party was quite well, Mila Yashura grimaced. They were Novices back then but now, after both of them ascended the first level barrier and got themselves class titles, there was no way a support-class Specialist like her could deliver that kind of punch again to his face.</p>\n<p>“Mm. Let’s go,” Mila said to Romana. No matter how brave and reckless she was, as a non-combatant talent, she knew better than to sow another discord with the village’s young generation’s strongest.</p>\n<p>Pilek, the most cheerful in Bony’s group, who was actually the most friendly, waved his hand to the girls as they walked away. Neither of them bothered with him.</p>\n<p>“Ahhh, my sister’s been avoiding me lately,” Pilek grumbled. Romana, Mila’s friend, was actually his half-sister from different mother. He was a proud big brother when they were young, until their mothers had a fight and his half-sister moved into a separate house.</p>\n<p>“Pilek,” Bony called.</p>\n<p>“Yes boss?”</p>\n<p>“You should’ve kept your mouth shut.”</p>\n<p>Pilek wryly smiled and nodded. Polio also thought his friend Pilek couldn’t read between the line. Although Pilek’s remark was well-intentioned, it’d just make things worse for Bony. The bad mood from back three years ago still left after taste that made him and her uncomfortable dealing with each other.</p>\n<p>After that, more people were coming to see the young lady of Malikh Family.</p>\n<p>The talks and speculations about her hair made the boys think she was dissatisfied with her engagement with Shira Yashura. Thus giving them hopes to snatch her away. It was no exaggeration to say that most of the boys fell for her, especially after they saw how the young lady grew beautifully. They surrounded this girl who had this icy expression on her face, though she herself greatly concentrated on holding a bow and an arrow, eyes straight to the archery target dozens of meters from her. She shot. And when the arrow hit splendidly, the boys would cheer and fawn all over her. The girl kept her face cold despite the flooding flattery coming at her way.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” a young man in his early twenty stepped forward from the bunch of admirers and confidently said, “I see you have this different aura about you. Something special that I can’t quite get my fingers on it, and I can’t help but feel curious about you.”</p>\n<p>That was supposed to be a pick-up line, but Bhela Malikh replied straightforwardly, “I changed. Now I’m Level 10 and not a Novice anymore.”</p>\n<p>“Oooohhhh!!” the crowd was surprised. Reaching the first barrier and got a class title at fifteen years old was the second time in these two decades. The first one was Bony. However, considering the girl was quite a talent enough for people in the capital to notice her, there was a high chance for her to snatch the crown as Badril Village’s young generation’s strongest from Bony sooner than everyone expected.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” the young man called for her attention again, despite his first attempt at hitting on her was an utter failure. “I see your beautiful sharp eyes and beautiful nimble hands and your beautiful pretty face. The class you’ve got must be… a beautiful <b>Archer</b>, right?”</p>\n<p>“I am an archer,” Bhela replied tight-lipped. Well, it was obvious when she picked a bow the first thing she arrived here.</p>\n<p>“Ah, a beautiful and talented Archer then! It’s a pity, though for such a fine beautiful flower like yourself to be thrown into a heap of cow dung…”</p>\n<p>The remark made Bhela Malikh raise her brows. She somehow could predict where the topic was going to be directed.</p>\n<p>“That stupid engagement is what I say! How could a diamond such as yourself be forced to marry a trash from Yashura Family?”</p>\n<p>He sighed like he pitied the harsh fate of the beauty. And though unlikeable as he was, the murmurs of the crowd seemingly agreed with him. At that point, someone said, “That’s true. Even my ten years old nephew is one Level above him. Such trash to become…”</p>\n<p>The words stopped, Bhela looked at the person who said that. “The one from Yashura Family--he’s still a Level 3 Novice?”</p>\n<p>It was someone else who replied to her question. “Ah, yes, he’s stuck and made no progress even since Young Lady Bhela went outside the village. Everyone calls him The Eternal Novice.”</p>\n<p>And this made her raised brows turned into a frown. Going by the crowd, for a Level 5 Novice by fifteen years old was already considered slow progress even by the standard of rural places like Badril Village. Mostly at that age the youngsters already reached Level 7, the diligent ones could reach Level 8 with hard work. Faster than that, not counting usage of an unreasonable amount of growth-hack potions--which most children from rich noble families did, could be considered a talent amongst the younger generation. However, to think of a boy one year before his own coming-of-age ceremony coming still stuck at such low-level talent, even though if he was the heir of Badril Village’s major families, people would still call him trash, even in public.</p>\n<p>“Ah, Young Lady Bhela! You don’t have to bother yourself with such eyesore trash. I know you’re troubled with the careless arrangement your father made, but if we put our mind to it, we can--”</p>\n<p>All was well until the young man put bad words about her father. Never did he expect that the girl would mercilessly retract her hand just before the tips of their fingers touched.</p>\n<p>“Please don’t pretend you were familiar with me,” that was what she said.</p>\n<p>The rain of snickers rang all around him. Despite him glaring left and right in an intimidating manner, there was no way for him to suppress the crowd from humiliating him further. At the time he realized the chance for him to court the Young Lady of Malikh Family, the sole daughter of the Malikh Family Patriarch, was pitifully close to nothing. Thus, in a moment of spontaneity, he thought of a scheme to save his face and sounded it with a flash of desperate smirk plastered on his face. He grabbed a bow and said, “I see Young Lady Bhela rather reserved toward us long friends after two years abroad. Hmm, yeah, this is a perfect chance, by the way. I’m an Archer too, see. So why not this senior teach you a thing or two? Seventy meters--perhaps a good learning experience for young lady, no?”</p>\n<p>The surrounding began chattering lively. It was obvious it was a challenge as Archers. And the young man’s smirk turned more and more confident at the girl’s unresponsiveness. No matter how much potential talent one had, time and experience playing a vital role in assessing one’s current performance whether she was Archer or Priest or Knight or other classes. Skills, abilities one acquired after reaching the first barrier and getting a new class title could only progress with constant tempering in battle and improved alongside one’s level. The young man was a Level 12 Archer. So theoretically, a Level 10 new Archer like Bhela Malikh would need a few more years before she could beat the opponent in a fair competition.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh was annoyed. She glared at the ones who were supposed to be guarding the field. But Bony and his lackeys were busy counting coins. For Bhela, the crowd were a bunch of stupid annoying busybodies who prevented her to train in peace. But for Bony and his lackeys the crowd was simply a bunch of gold mines.</p>\n<p>“Please watch closely how I do it, Young Lady Bhela. See my elbow? If you could do the same way I do it, I’m sure your archery skill would improve significantly.”</p>\n<p>No one really bothered with the ‘humble direction’ the young man spouted. Bhela didn’t spare him a glance. She looked straight to target seventy meters from where she was standing. Repressing his anger, the young man began to shoot three arrows one by one splendidly; the final one landed right in the center of the target that was marked in red dot.</p>\n<p>He was satisfied with the result. Glancing at the young lady, this young man wanted to utter more words to improve his image. However, right before he opened his mouth, he found Bhela already drew her arrow, released it, and it hit one arrow splendidly. Not just hitting the target, but an arrow the young man previously shot. The second was the same. And the final third arrow also hit the arrow on the red dot.</p>\n<p>What was that? She used a skill? The young man wanted to object but his tongue froze and his lips quivered. Did she use <b>Far Sight</b> skill that enhanced eye-sight a hundred of meters away? Did she use <b>Boost Accuracy</b>, the skill that was supposedly forbidden to be used in duel between Archers? To think of beating him, an Archer older than her and 2 Level right above her, in such a devastating manner… she must be cheating, right?</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” the defeated young man said weakly, “I didn’t use my mana between my shots.”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh nodded.</p>\n<p>“Neither was I.”</p>\n<p>With that, Bhela turned around and left the crowd of dumbfounded boys with steps full of grace. She approached the entrance, returned back the bow she used to the three delinquents who just let people mess with her training and said coldly, “If this is how the famous Young Master Elzhier manages his property, then there’s no need for me to come here again. Please excuse me.”</p>\n<p>Bony’s expression didn’t change much as he still crossed his arms and rested his back casually on the wall.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Pilek, the one received the returned bow from Bhela, waved his hand again and shouted, “Take care, princess!”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Because she couldn’t train her archery peacefully in public, Bhela returned back to Malikh Family and trained in her private training place.</p>\n<p>It was originally a backyard turned archery ground, made by Malikh Family Patriarch after knowing his daughter showed interest in archery. It was nothing fancy. It was spacious and good enough when she started with her first bow but now Bhela felt the place was lacking. At most, she had to live with the meager fifty meters range maximum. Therefore, the practice she had made a habit of had to wait.</p>\n<p>Therefore, Bhela Malikh decided to put her mind over something else than her usual practice instead.</p>\n<p>She drew a deep breath. A table was provided with dozens of arrows laid on top of it. Bhela picked four at the same time, nocked them on her bow string. She began to aim.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the air surrounding her changed. Her inexperience as a newly Novice-graduate showed by the obvious mana that leaked from the inside out. With naked eyes, her mana looked calm colorful haze that consisted of four bold colors, tangling and struggling with each other for dominance. Her eyelashes quivered. Channeling mana to cast a skill she yet had mastered felt like trying to stand on the raging sea waves while she herself was being a weak newborn.</p>\n<p><em>Whhhhuuuuushh--</em></p>\n<p><em>Shuuuhsh--</em></p>\n<p><em>Ssshhhuuuush--</em></p>\n<p><em>Wwhuuuussh!!</em></p>\n<p>The fastest arrow, coated with sparking yellow-colored mana, hit one of the targets at around forty meters range. But the others performed pitifully. The one infused with wet blue-colored mana didn’t even reach two-third of the desired range. The green-colored one, an arrow infused with mana that generated unstable wind trajectory flew far far away, as if it was getting swallowed by the sky, never to be seen again. The last one, the red-colored arrow, was horrifying. It hit the training ground fence instead the target. The bamboo fences suddenly set ablaze by raging flames as soon as the said arrow came into contact with them.</p>\n<p><em>Clap clap clap!</em></p>\n<p>Uninvited claps resounded across the training ground. On the wall Good-Natured Spirit clapping after watching a good spectacle. For getting hand claps from a Nalaq like him, naturally the level of talent Bhela showed just now was far beyond ordinary.</p>\n<p>“Thank you…” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>It appeared she knew beforehand the four-arrows skill she shot would make a mess. So she gathered the maidservants and made them extinguish the fences that started to burn into ashes. “Thank you, thank you for your hard work,” she said to a pair of maidservants who briskly went back and forth to kill the fire before its spread.</p>\n<p>“Ah! Young lady, what skill was that just now?” one of the maidservants gawked after the fire was extinguished.</p>\n<p>“That wasn’t just your ordinary Archer skill, was it?” added the other.</p>\n<p>Summoning a blazing fire just with an arrow and pure mana was unheard of. At least, the maidservants knew nobody in the village could do that.</p>\n<p>Bhela drank a glass of murky liquify herbs mixed with mint to cool down her manasphere. “It’s something I learned when I was away,” she said after putting down the glass on the tray her maid servants provided. She continued, “I still can’t master it, though.”</p>\n<p>She cast her eyes at the unharmed targets one by one. Shooting at forty meters range was still too much for her using four arrows at the same time. When the maidservants realized her difficulty, they encouraged her to simplify it and shoot one arrow at a time. However at their suggestion, Bhela shook her head. “It’s the requirement of this skill I’ve got to shoot four arrows,” she explained.</p>\n<p>The maidservants nodded at her words and apologized for their shallow suggestion.</p>\n<p>“Don’t mind that,” Bhela waved her hand. “There’s something I heard from people, by the way. Something about Young Master Yashura.”</p>\n<p>The two maidservants glanced at each other before one of them replied. “The rumor says… he holed up from the public’s view because he’s ashamed he can’t even become a Level 4 Novice.”</p>\n<p>“Are the Yashura Family elders still favoring him as the heir of Yashura Family Patriarch?”</p>\n<p>“We don’t know whether they still favor him or not. But Yashura Family always united in their standing. So unless the current Patriarch of Yashura Family has a son, the Young Master Shira Yashura will undoubtedly become the next patriarch.”</p>\n<p>“No rumors about the Yashura Family elders wavering then?”</p>\n<p>The maidservants shook their heads altogether.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela… apologize for giving you my shallow suggestion once again but…” one of the maidservants came near to Bhela and whispered, “With him as the heir, Yashura Family’s future will be bleak. Everyone in our family said your father’s bad condition is a bad omen for us mingling with those simple Yashuras. I’m very sorry if this sounds impudent--but you should’ve better cut ties with them before too late, young lady. Madam was too grieved by your father’s ill health to make decisions thus the only one who can save our Malikh Family is you.”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at the maidservant. The glint on her eyes changed.</p>\n<p>“There’s already a plan laid to help our Malikh Family,” that was all Bhela said. “You better not say something like that again. You lucky no one here beside me to hear you utter that kind of words.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you for your mercy, young lady! We are sorry for being impudent!”</p>\n<p>They decided to make it history with only the four of them who knew the previous conversation. The four of them; the young lady and two maid servants and one Nalaq spirit who came here uninvited.</p>\n<p>“It seems I just heard something I shouldn’t hear,” Good-Natured Spirit said while he rubbed his chin. He came here peeking. He didn’t have the intention to reveal himself while the girls below had a secret conversation ignorant of his presence.</p>\n<p>After that Bhela continued with light training. Good-Natured Spirit watched her doing simple shooting, she didn’t even use a slightest of her mana from then on. Yawning, Good-Natured Spirit stood up. Then he flew away from Malikh Family and began to look for some other interesting thing to sate his boredom.</p>\n<hr>\n<authors-note id=\"Radhy\">\n<p>Testing, testing.

Please, anything but there!” she promptly cling on the head maid’s legs. “Don’t send me to Young Lady’s place, please so something for me to get my old post back, we’re sisters for years, head maid!

Do you think I could get it back that easily?”</p>\n<p>“H-head maid…” Jane knew, although Butler Tim didn’t have enough influence to be a tyrant in Blackwood Family’s manor, still not someone Jane could afford to offend. Biting her bottom lip, she whispered, “Please, head maid… if I perished due to bad luck, how could my family pay their debts?”</p>\n<p>“Get up now. Didn’t you say you have a way to pay it without working here for a dozen years more?”</p>\n<p>“That was before,” Jane’s voice was hoarse, “I never would’ve thought that bastard only spout empty promises of taking care of my family and other bullshit.

Everybody’s ended up dead after they were sent to Young Lady’s place!”</p>\n<p>“Nonsense.

She immediately came to head maid as soon as she knew her old post being taken and didn’t have time to gossip with other maidservants. “Really, head maid, you know I just came back. Don’t talk in a roundabout way…”</p>\n<p>“Sir Arden is going to hire an expert to clear plague in our Young Lady’s mansion, he’s planning to do it in a month's time,” the head maid said. “You know Sir Arden’s reputation, and you know how reliable his words are. Go serve Young Lady there--by the time Sir Arden comes with the hired expert, he’ll be grateful for loyal servants who willing to accompany his niece in her difficult time!”</p>\n<p>Hearing the urge behind head maid’s tone, Jane choked by her own cry from earlier. Even Madam Blackwood had to be polite to this younger brother of hers--as the man’s reputation was the sole reason Madam could be so tyrannical on ruling the house. But even then Sir Arden was too lazy to pay attention to his sister and her be. Jane, a mere maidservant--could she really gain Sir Arden Blackwood’s favor?</p>\n<p>The head maid continued, “What are you hesitating for? Even Floria that girl who even prettier than you couldn’t even get Sir Arden to glance at her--do you think any girl can have the same chance as yours right now?” she paused, learning the contour of Jane’s expression before she said again, “even if you can’t be his mistress, Jane, I assure you that even Butler Tim won’t be able to touch your position if Sir Arden Blackwood has a good impression on you.”</p>\n<p>Jane lowered her head. Head maid was right. A chance to get on Sir Arden Blackwood’s good side wouldn’t come as easily as this.</p>\n<p>She calculated the weight and found that, since two of her friends were sent to serve Young Lady Blackwood six month ago and still survive, a good odd that Sir Arden Blackwood would rescue her before the disease from Young Lady’s cursed bad luck would take her life for good.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>There was no need for her to prepare anything.

This steward talked as if he was sincerely giving advice, yet for those in the main manor who didn’t know the rumors about their young lady?

Both were somehow familiar. A moment later, Jane was stupefied when she found out that the two white doll-like girls with black eyebags on them were actually Emeralda and Jenny she had known back since her first year being a maidservant. No longer Jane could see two noise sisters of hers who always skipped work to gossip, only two sets of dead eyes left, seeing her but not with greeting eyes, almost like strangers.</p>\n<p>“Welcome,” Emeralda greeted with a flat tone.</p>\n<p>“Welcome,” the other girl repeated. No enthusiasm could be hear within their voices, as if they were greeting a stranger before them.</p>\n<p>Jane didn’t expect this.

Even though the expensive Ngajen Ceremony drew near a good number of ducks and a goat were butchered along with their spice reserves taken out. There were laughters, there lots of people wanted to get on the good side of the only Young Lady of Malikh Family.</p>\n<p>But Bhela’s face was straight the whole time. Given choices, she’d rather have a small dinner with her mother and sick father right now.</p>\n<p>“I heard you went to Elzhier’s training facility as soon as you arrived, young lady,” a bald elder said with big smile. “That is no good. You just return home after four days of traveling. You must have a good rest first.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you for your concern, Elder Jhamil.”</p>\n<p>Bhela had experience with people during her two years abroad to know the meaning of smiles like Elder Jhamil’s--the kind of smile that didn’t reach eyes, the fake kind of smile. She always found it was uncomfortable whenever she met with one. Yet what was more uncomfortable was the fact she was the star of the party. Flatteries and congratulations flowing in. Bhela kept nodding her head and had a smiling expression on her face. No one really had a good time beside the ignorant families who came to find abundant foods to eat.</p>\n<p>Finally toward the end of the big dinner Elder Jhamil gave a few speeches and led everyone for their patriarch's health. Bhela hadn’t come home for two years, but she was alert enough to know the popular opinion going around inside the Malikh Family. She knew her father was disliked by many because the engagement he set up more than a dozen years ago, back when she wasn’t even able to speak yet, back when the Malikhs didn’t think much of it and didn’t know the girl back then would grow splendidly into a fair Young Lady. What she didn’t expect was that, Elder Jhamil, would point it out in front of other family members.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady, I’m sure you’re aware about it by now, but the one from Yashura Family is still stuck on the same level from back when you were leaving for your seminars.”</p>\n<p>“I’m aware, yes,” she said. “And?”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil smiled dryly at the question, he said, “With a partner that lazy he’d drag you sooner or later, wouldn’t he? Especially with special talent as yours, many would have second thoughts. But then how about you? Are you fine with that, Young Lady?”</p>\n<p>Bhela didn’t immediately say what was on her mind. She quietly picked the warm ginger drink they served her, drank it, while her eyes glanced at a certain direction where two maidservants who immediately glanced down the moment her eyes came into contact with theirs.</p>\n<p>Seeing that Bhela wasn’t that responsive with the idea, Elder Jhamil spoke further, “Young Lady, don’t worry, we as Malikhs only worried about your future. If you feel injustice in your heart, you must be brave, you must voice it out to your parents, Young Lady Bhela--all of us Malikhs support you for whichever path you choose! Isn’t that right, everyone?”</p>\n<p>“That’s right!” someone shouted. Then came more rougher voice--</p>\n<p>“We don’t fear those Yashura’s retaliation, Young Lady. You don’t have to be afraid they’ll come here to bully us because of that trash from Yashura Family!”</p>\n<p>“We support you, Young Lady!”</p>\n<p>“Don’t be afraid!”</p>\n<p>The dry smile on Elder Jhamil turned elated when people were chanting along with his cue. It was only when Bhela slowly put down the warm glass of ginger drink in her hand did they stop making ruckus, everyone was waiting for what Bhela was going to say next.</p>\n<p>“I think,” Bhela said with the remarkable cold expression of hers, “any engagement in the main family should be the main family’s business only.”</p>\n<p>She stopped. Not a single more soul dared to send her further flatteries until dinner was over. Even the bald Elder Jhamil, the most enthusiastic of all them, quietly sat back where he belonged.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>“Ah, young lady, please wait, Young Lady Bhela!” the bald Elder Jhamil chased her, trotting, with a box in his hands.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh frowned upon hearing the voice. But she hid her expression well as turned around and asked, “Is something the matter, Elder Jhamil?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, in fact, there’s one matter a bit inappropriate to deal in the family hall,” as soon as Elder Jhamil said that, he opened the box he carried. It was a dress. “It’s something that I get from a merchant who has a lot of dealing with people in the west. He told me this is apparently the current popular fashion for western nobles. I think it’s good for Young Lady.”</p>\n<p>Bhela studied Elder Jhamil’s expression. If the dress truly was a fashionable goods then the elder ought to have paid a quite of coins to get this. As far as Bhela Malikh remembered, Elder Jhamil she knew wasn’t this kind even when her father the patriarch married. Naturally with such an expensive homecoming gift, Bhela was alerted.</p>\n<p>“Thank you for your kindness, Elder Jhamil. Bhela will treasure this well.”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, you don’t have to mention it, Young Lady Bhela,” Elder Jhamil said with a laugh. Then, while rubbing his palms unconsciously, the bald elder began to smile--not a fake one like he usually did have, a genuine smile, one that reflected his current emotion--the smile of greed. “By the way, young lady,” he continued, “I heard you getting along well with the Young Master from the noble Blackwood Family during your time away…”</p>\n<p>“Young Lady of Blackwood Family is my friend,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“Yeah but… I also heard in the next ngajen ceremony, Young Master Blackwood would grace us with his presence… is that true?”</p>\n<p>“I wouldn’t know.”</p>\n<p>“Hehe,” Elder Jhamil chuckled knowingly. “I think things would go well if you wear that dress during ngajen ceremony, young lady.”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh said a short and ambiguous reply and tried to get away from the bald elder. After she escaped in the lone corridor, she took out the dress from the box. The said dress was glimmering under the torchlight, yet, in spite of that, Bhela wasn’t happy the slightest bit.</p>\n<p>“This kind of thing…”</p>\n<p>A proper dress for ladies of southern people was hiding everything below the collarbone. Showing more, akin to invite men to do something indecent. Bhela wasn’t a conservative to follow Mossack customes down rigidly as shown from her cutting her hair short despite the gesture usually reserved for unavailable widows. But still, something like decency of girlhood, was something even someone duller than Bhela should have. Even daring courtesans would think twice to wear this kind of provocative dress to attend a festivity made by the Mossack majority.</p>\n<p>It was distasteful. Bhela didn’t want to think too much about it. After putting back the dress, Bhela walked again to the east wing of Malikh Family where her father was resting.</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim Malikh’s sick room once used as the family’s <b>Alchemist</b> workplace. It had long been vacant, thus usually used to care sick and injured people, as it had the most complete medicinal facility in the entire Malikh Family. Upon entering the room, Bhela found the thick pungent of herbs made her head light. And still she was amazed by how loyal her mother was to taking care of her father closely when servants would need to take a breather of fresh air ten minutes inside the sick room.</p>\n<p>“Father, mother, I’m back…. Did they send some food here?”</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh, the mother, was the one who replied to Bhela. “They did. Some people might forget about the patriarch’s little family but there are still good aunties working in the kitchen,” a middle-aged woman said with a hint of sadness, helplessness, and resentment.</p>\n<p>“Does mother want some hot tea? I’ll go fetch and say my thanks for those good aunties,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“You girl, sit down. You just returned today, now you want to run around doing errands?” Madam Malikh smiled weakly. “How’s the village, dear? Does it change from the way you remembered?”</p>\n<p>“Somes changed, others stay the same, mother,” Bhela said. She got to the table and put the box Elder Jhamil gifted, then took it off her mind. She then picked a random book from the shelves. “Can I stay here for a while?” she asked while showing the book to her mother, telling her the intention that she was going to read it there.</p>\n<p>The mother’s smile turned strained. At noon, she purposely told this daughter of hers to see around the village because she was afraid, if Bhela spent too much time in this room, she would feel uncomfortable by the thick medicinal smell and grow to hate the idea of staying. Even some maidservants a few years older than her were fidgeting and eyeing for the door every time they had duty to bring a meal here. Yet, looking from her daughter’s unflinching eyes, Madam Malikh was relented in the end.</p>\n<p>“Sit here,” the mother offered her chair for her daughter, while she sat down on the edge of her husband’s bed.</p>\n<p>Bhela’s moved with small, noiseless steps, trying not to wake up her father. But it was unfortunate that her father woke up nonetheless.</p>\n<p>“Le… letter…”</p>\n<p>The quivering voice escaped his cracking dry lips.</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh wanted to retort. Not the letter again. No matter how many times she read it aloud he still thirst for the letter as if it was the only salvation left for his life. Nonetheless, she surrendered and she picked a smooth, white paper made from wood--the kind which was expensive and usually used overseas--and began to read its content.</p>\n<p>“I understand your situation. But sending help from where I am takes a while. Ask Yulong’s help for now.”</p>\n<p>As if the letter was his assurance, Patriarch Ghalim Malikh closed his eyes again.</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at her mother who folded the recently opened letter, she asked. “Whose letter is that?”</p>\n<p>“Your great-grandmother who lived overseas,” her mother said.</p>\n<p>“I see.” Bhela wasn’t sure which relative her mother mentioned, but she decided to ask something else seeing her mother’s bad mood. “Why Great-grandmother mentioned something about Yulong? Isn’t Yulong the Yashura Family’s butler, mother?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know, I reckon she told us to rely on Yashura Family instead.”</p>\n<p>The strained smile on her mother’s face made Bhela realize that even her mother was reluctant when Yashura Family was mentioned. As a mother, she loved Bhela dearly, and was the one to believe in her daughter before everyone else. She believed in her daughter’s future. That was why she was first to oppose Bhela’s engagement when the sour rumors about the heir of the Yashura Family started. Never would she expect that her Malikh Family would be in dire straits so suddenly they needed Yashura Family’s help to get them out of this mess.</p>\n<p>“Have you sent someone to inform Yulong, mother?” Bhela asked.</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh shook her head. Bhela reckoned with Elder Jhamil gaining influence so fast, her mother wouldn’t know anyone to trust in this kind of situation.</p>\n<p>The girl then gave her mother a glass of water to ease her down. “I’ll let him know then,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Dear,” Madam Malikh brushed her daughter’s hair as she smiled helplessly, “showing your face in Yashura Family might complicate things…”</p>\n<p>Bhela patted her mother’s hands and assured her, “Don’t worry, mother,” she said, “I’ll ask favors from people I know from Elzhier Family.”</p>\n<p>Bhela thought her parents would go along with her arrangement. Madam Malikh hung open her lips as if she wanted to say something, but then she tightened her smile in the end. Unexpectedly, it was a weak voice that disagreed instead.</p>\n<p>“Bhela… don’t...” her father whispered weakly.</p>\n<p>“Dear?” mother leaned on toward his mouth.</p>\n<p>“What is it, father?” Bhela, too, leaned closer.</p>\n<p>“Don’t… ask… don’t… favor… purple...” the sickly patriarch’s voice turned hoarse and defragmented before he completed his sentences. Bhela and her mother quickly shushed him, they couldn’t afford to see the sick father forcing himself with this condition. Even after two minutes, he still struggled to tell his words to his daughter. Though eventually he fell to slumber by himself after his wife tried to put him to sleep with her eyes wet with tears.</p>\n<p>Beside her mother, Bhela picked a bamboo fan and used it to make a breeze for her father’s sleep to be more comfortable. Her expression was flat and straight the entire time, but inside, she was disturbed by the words her father failed to tell her.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>For as long as the Yashuras knew him, their Young Master Shira Yashura lived alone in his house. The only other person who should’ve been living here, his father, didn’t come home for months already. So ever since his uncle let him live in his house a few years back, Shira enjoyed an independent lifestyle he’d take for granted one of these days.</p>\n<p>At night, his schedule often filled with working on painting commissions Good-Natured Spirit gave him. Which, unfortunately, not something he wished for people to know. This part of his schedule was one of his secrets, if known by a certain meddlesome cousin, hell would surely be waiting for him.</p>\n<p>“I told you again and again,” a voice from behind him blurted, “you should’ve shown the boobs a little more.”</p>\n<p>Shira turned his head and groaned when he found the Nalaq’s annoying face a little bit too close. “Can you knock the door first?”</p>\n<p>“No way. I came through the wall. Door? What is door? Never use the thing since ages ago.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t creep up from behind, then. At least preserve your dignity as a Nalaq.”</p>\n<p>“I told you, don’t call me Nalaq,” Good-Natured Spirit hissed. “Anyway, boobs! The bweebs!! Make it more sexy! More bold and open!”</p>\n<p>“That’s not what we agreed on,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“Just a little, man. A little dot--tiny nipply dot--that’s all I’m asking for.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t push it, old man.”</p>\n<p>“Ah! You’re not fun anymore,” Good-Natured Spirit moaned in disatisfaction. In addition of Nalaq, Good-Natured Spirit was never fond of being called old. He died in his early thirty. So he retained the look, and he--according to himself--was still as handsome as ever. “Ah, forget it,” he waved his hand lazily. “Your drawings are second-rate porns anyway.”</p>\n<p>“You’re not paying for this one again?” Shira asked.</p>\n<p>“Not this one. Too safe. Don’t want it. At least make her boobs and butt bigger for the next time.”</p>\n<p>Shira sighed and wrapped it up for tonight. Everytime Good-Natured Spirit cancelled the commission's Shira wouldn’t have any choice but selling the paintings half-baked to a peddler he knew. Not even a half price, he’d be lucky if the rejected paintings would sell even one-fifth from Good-Natured Spirit’s usual payment.</p>\n<p>While Shira was tidying up his room, Good-Natured Spirit looked at the lady in the painting. The Nalaq said, “Hmm. I gotta say, man, despite your second-rate skill you’re natural when it comes to drawing faces. Especially the eyes. How should I say this… those aren’t the eyes of cheap bitches usually have, I tell you.”</p>\n<p>Shira didn’t know whether he should feel flattered or not. After he tidied the room and hid the naughty painting carefully, he prepared to go to sleep.</p>\n<p>“Oh, by the way,” Good-Natured Spirit said as Shira changed his shirt, “I’ve checked on your girl, brat. She’s a real good beauty, alright. Her talent too is not to be scoffed at. And also--boobs.”</p>\n<p>Shira glanced at him with tightened brows. “I’ll be troubled if they somehow trace it back to me in case the Young Lady of Malikh Family was assaulted.”</p>\n<p>“Hehe, relax man, I’ll never touch my buddy’s chick. We’re buddies, aren’t we?”</p>\n<p>Shira wanted to say no but he felt it’d be better for him not to comment on that. He then hurriedly kicked out the Nalaq so he could get some sleep in peace.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In almost all of Mossack race traditions, ngajen ceremony held monthly in villages near a mountain. It was one of those legacy of ancient Mossack that still around simply because of its practice brought safety to the people. Originally was a session of prayers and offerings to calm down Selaqs which dwelling on the mountains--they had to, because many stories being passed down in every families that even ancient tribe chieftains and heroes couldn’t do nothing if waves of Selaqs rampaged over the southern lands. Though, as the cost of ceremony getting more expensive as the time went on and getting more political, nowadays it became a time of feasts for big families to assert their surrounding influence. And a time of feasts where small and independent families gained side incomes from providing food and good for the big families’ feats. Ngajen ceremony was also the main reason why there was a weird rule for every Mossack-rooted families, tribes, and clans, that saying the leaders must be someone of a great cook--the majority of them were simply foodies.</p>\n<p>“And thus, Shira my boy--” the patriarch said as he played with his thick moustache, “--us southern people are naturally different from those imperialist western Haldeens and those warmongers feudalists of eastern Kaya. We don’t simply become leaders because of our noble bloodlines or merits and achievements in battle but simply because of food. This is an important lesson, my boy: no matter one hails from a noble blood or being a simple commoner, no matter one’s an enemy or ally, in the end, everyone’s going to eat happily and peacefully when we southern cooks shove foods up in their mouths. Remember that.”</p>\n<p>Shira Yashura quietly nodded. He didn’t plan to learn cooking from the start but, as the heir of Yashura Family, spending effort on foods probably one of the most important lessons before he became the next Patriarch of Yashura Family.</p>\n<p>“So you understand. Good. Sooner or later you’ll understand being strong is not everything, having talent is not everything,” the patriarch said. “Look at your father, for instance. He’s the only one in Badril Village who has an Unique class since… I don’t know, many many years. He’s pretty badass, eh? But why is that the one who ended up being the patriarch was me?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, Uncle Shuro, please do tell me.”</p>\n<p>Shuro Yashura, the patriarch uncle, smiled as he looked at his obedient nephew. He then half-bragging said, “Because he can only boil water, that’s why. Cooking is a great heritage of our ancestors thus those who have no talent on it as to be satisfied with being a second-rate Mossack. The only reason why people like me always ended up becoming the leader of clans because we Mossack appreciate food to a very high degree. Justice is food. Food is justice. With great cooking comes great responsibility.”</p>\n<p>But from the side a sour voice butted in, “Ohh. You’ll never know how much bullshit my father made up just now.”</p>\n<p>Uncle and nephew turned their heads to see a daughter pop her head from the window. Apparently, Mila Yashura had just returned from doing morning errands.</p>\n<p>“What are you guys doing anyway?” she asked. Apparently, in the kitchen, she saw her father and cousin shredding a ridiculous amount of coconuts. No one else was here in the kitchen, so Mila asked, “Did you two really do these by all yourselves?”</p>\n<p>“Of course,” her father, the revered patriarch, said as his hand vigorously shredded coconut. He couldn’t hide the annoying proud smile on his mustache filled face.</p>\n<p>“Since dawn?” Mila asked again suspiciously.</p>\n<p>“Food is justice. Justice is food. With great cooking comes great responsibility. Shredding coconut is one of the fundamental lessons for Shira to become a great patriarch in the future.”</p>\n<p>“Well,” Mila commented, “that’s dumb.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, girl! What do you know? You know nothing about the important philosophy behind every essence of coconuts,” Shuro Yashura exploded. “Since you a girl who don’t have to lead the family then probably you’ll never understand. You’ll never have to understand the hidden substance of every food you’ve eaten! Almost every Mossack delicacies made with coconuts. That Bulayak Satay sauce you like so much is made with coconut milk as a base! And don’t forget goat stew! And baked shredded coconuts cookies! And rendang! You name it. Coconuts have been granted us with delicious foods ever since ancestors were hunters-gatherers! Our very roots of being the descendants of ancient Mossack race can be traced as long as one ponder the mystery behind every shred of coconuts! Look at ancient empires! The ancient Aratararadararam Empire, for an instance, five thousands years ago, formed their empire solely by cultivating lots of coconut trees! They’re building civilizations relying only on the blessing of coconuts! That’s how great coconuts are! Only us who were born to lead our very empire can understand how miraculous are to be feeling joyous in pondering the great essence of shredded coconuts. You don’t know this much then you’re a dumb girl, eh. What a waste of a daughter you are!!” After taking a deep breath, Patriarch Shuro snorted at his impudent daughter, then glanced at Shira, smiling. “Isn’t that right, Shira my boy?”</p>\n<p>That was dumb. Even Shira knew that much. Because of that he kept his head hung low and focused on his task of shredding coconuts, pretending not to hear the question coming at him.</p>\n<p>“See?” the patriarch smirked. “He’s too absorbed by the grace of shredding coconuts he doesn’t notice my words.”</p>\n<p>Mila rolled her eyes, began to ignore her father. “Anyway, Shira! Have you heard the story about that girl Malikh beating up the best Archer kid single-handedly?”</p>\n<p>Shira of course knew about the archery duel that happened yesterday. Because Yashura Family and Malikh Family were entangled in a planned marriage, almost everyone in Yashura Family--including servants and clueless children--were talking about it. Yet he couldn’t raise his head and answer. Do that, and his uncle Shuro would know he only pretended to be interested in shredding coconuts. He’d only hurt his uncle’s feelings that way. Thus, in spite of Mila being overly loud today, all Shira needed to do was shredding and shredding and sometimes stopped to feel the shredded coconuts with his fingers, releasing a solemn sigh, as if he found something profound in every fiber of shredded coconuts.</p>\n<p>“That’s my boy, you understand all too well after all,” Shuro Yashura nodded in satisfaction. He was relieved his successor could be that enlightened by the grace of shredded coconuts. He then glared at his own blood daughter, who supposed to be the princess of the family, nagging so loudly that she stood in borderline of being a tomboy girl and a fussy aunty.</p>\n<p>“Oh, man, just leave him alone, would ya? Just think how many years for him to catch up with his girl--the more you hold him back the more people talk shit about him, father!”</p>\n<p>“Please dear! Is that how you talk with your father? I’m not holding him back, okay?” Patriarch Shuro Yashura then asked Shira, “do I hold you back, Shira my boy?”</p>\n<p>Shira further lowered his head and pretended not to hear that as if he was a turtle.</p>\n<p>“Better be careful. He’s too deep in coconuts he doesn’t even hear me,” the patriarch gave his daughter a glare.</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura rolled her eyes. She crouched and disappeared from the window view, then stood up again a moment later. Her hand clutching a pebble.</p>\n<p>The patriarch gawked, “Oi, what are you--”</p>\n<p>Mila aimed the pebble at Shira and it hit his head with an audible knock.</p>\n<p>“Thousands of gods!” Shira swore.</p>\n<p>“Too deep my ass,” Mila sneered. Unlike her father, she knew too well whenever Shira playing dumb.</p>\n<p>“What do you want?” Shira asked as he rubbed his head.</p>\n<p>“Let’s train your sword skill. You don’t want to face your fiancée with that crappy skill of yours, do you?”</p>\n<p>Shira glanced at his uncle unwillingly. “Do I have to meet with Bhela in her Family?”</p>\n<p>“That’s right, Shira my boy. You rarely visit other houses during ngajen ceremony but old folks from the Elder Council think this is a good time to show Malikh Family our good will,” Shuro Yashura said. “Remember to pray for their patriarch’s health too. He’s your father best friend, after all.”</p>\n<p>As if waiting for Patriarch Shuro’s completed his words, the door of the kitchen knocked at the very moment. A tall gray-haired old man entered. He had a posture that was straight and sharp, classy western-style butler uniform that hadn’t had looked worn out in spite no tailors around to know how to sew the said uniform, and his hand was balanced to hold a tray with a dozen elixirs on top of it with his left hand fingers, while his right hand rested on his back as if he followed an etiquette stranger to most of the villagers. He was the sole butler in Yashura Family--and perhaps, the only butler that ever employed in Badril VIllage.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira, this month’s elixirs your father sent for you have arrived,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Thank you, Yulong.”</p>\n<p>As usual, Shira drank elixirs his father sent abroad without a rest. The content was painfully bitter, thank goodness Yulong provided brown sugars for the boy to nibble after he drank those. His father Jhuro Yashura said--in a letter from abroad--that the elixirs were some kind of nutrient custom-made only for Shira, were expensive, so they could only afford them every one or two months.</p>\n<p>“How do you feel, Shira my boy?”</p>\n<p>Shira said as he munched a brown sugar to dismiss the bitter after taste. “Uh-hm. Better?”</p>\n<p>The family always thought they were a level-boost potion, Jhuro once sent a potion that could increase Shira’s level up to Level 3 in a single gulp after all. But the elixirs seemed to do nothing other than let Shira sleep comfortably at night. Still, his relatives, especially Mila, put their hopes on the resourceful Jhuro Yashura to nurture his own son--the heir of Yashura Family.</p>\n<p>Seeing the lack of enthusiasm in his nephew’s eyes, Patriarch Shuro laughed and said, “Haha. If those don’t work on your progress problems, don’t let it bother you! Your father worked very hard as an instructor in second-rank school and he’d definitely send a better elixir, like that one from three years ago!”</p>\n<p>“Oh,” Shira nodded. The elixir from three years ago was special. He knew it the moment he drank the potion. The warm feeling surrounding his manasphere was special, as with only drinking from one bottle, he leveled up 2 levels overnight.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>After that his uncle let him go out of the kitchen, since it was promised that Shira would do errands for his aunt every morning.</p>\n<p>When he was heading off for his duty, Shira Yashura got pranked by Good-Natured Spirit in the hallway, popped out his head from a wall and cried, “Boo!”--which Shira ignored because Yulong the butler was walking behind him.</p>\n<p>Yulong said with a polite baritone voice of his, “Young Master Shira, do you perhaps would visit the peddler today?”</p>\n<p>Shira looked at the butler. The matter about him doing business with a peddler wasn’t known to the family; but since Yulong wasn’t a Yashura and had been taking care of him since little, he eventually knew about the few investment deals that Shira never talked about. After collecting his thoughts, the boy replied to Yulong’s question, “Depends on the errand I receive, really. My aunt still hasn’t given my errands this morning,” the boy said.</p>\n<p>“I see, Patriarch Shuro took your time since early morning, so if madam doesn’t take pity for you then young master would finish today’s morning errands a little too late.”</p>\n<p>“The market would be too crowded if that happened,” Shira lamented. It couldn’t be helped. Boys and girls around ages of nine and sixteen--before they received coming-of-age ceremony--had to finish several trivial tasks each morning from both parents. It was a custom mainly to educate filial piety, though some smart parents and big family policies would give errands for the young’uns to make them do things that were beneficial for their futures, like street smarts and forming their own social circles outside the playmates they met everyday. Because his mother wasn’t here since he was a baby, and his father never came home for months, it was his aunt who always gave him errands.</p>\n<p>“Young Master,” Yulong stopped him again, “I’m glad for Young Master taking initiatives to improve your life. You grow too fast for this old butler to look after you. But as a child stepping into the adult world, please let me give you a small advice.”</p>\n<p>“I’m all ears, Yulong.”</p>\n<p>Yulong said, “You cannot guarantee everyone’s nature all around you, Young Master. Especially those who come approaching you with impure motives. I hope Young Master understands this, and to not make friends with nasty people.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit, who was around, snorted.</p>\n<p>Shira pretended he didn’t hear the Nalaq and nodded at the butler’s words. “You don’t have to worry about the peddler. Even though he’s been peddling for two years now, I found the fella got a pretty good sense.”</p>\n<p>“Hearing your words relieves me greatly. Thank you.”</p>\n<p>Afterward, Yulong excused himself as he needed to check the servants’ works for the arrangement of Ngajen Ceremony. The butler unassumingly walked on the side of the corridor, avoiding Good-Natured Spirit who was floating in the way, as if he knew there was something unpleasant floating in the way.</p>\n<p>“So long, fucker,” Good-Natured Spirit flashed his middle finger to Yulong’s back who just passed him by. Of course, the old butler didn’t show any reaction to his insult.</p>\n<p>“Why did you always do that to him?” Shira said to him with a frown.</p>\n<p>“This middle finger?” Good-Natured Spirit asked back.</p>\n<p>“No, the insult.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit grinned.</p>\n<p>“You know nothing about this middle finger, eh? Hehehh heh....”</p>\n<p>Yulong was someone Shira heartily respected. He always used polite language when talking to the butler. Because of that he was irked by the way Good-Natured Spirit sneered.</p>\n<p>“I need to sell the painting you rejected before the market becomes too crowdy. Let’s go,” he said. Bantering with Good-Natured Spirit would only make him more cocky, so Shira held the urge to humor his annoying behavior and headed off to the village’s market.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Back in the kitchen, Mila stayed with his father--who still shredding coconuts--while she read from a see-through board in front of her.</p>\n<p>“Ugh… his experience didn’t even change a single point,” Mila groaned.</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro too engrossed himself in coconut to realize what his daughter was doing just now. “You did a <b>Status Window</b> on him?”</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura nodded. Her face was sour though. “Look at this, old man. See what’s wrong with the number?”</p>\n<p>“Hah, his <b>Dodge Rating</b> getting crazier than before,” Shuro Yashura said with his fingers rubbing his moustache.</p>\n<p>“No! Look, father--his combat attributes, look closely! <b>Strength</b>, <b>Agility</b>, <b>Dexterity</b>! All of them pitifully underdeveloped. And look at the <b>Wisdom</b> attribute now!”</p>\n<p>“Ooh, his Wisdom’s pretty high. I knew his head’s pretty good. No wonder he could ponder the real meaning of shredded coconuts… he’s really a wise kid, after all.”</p>\n<p>“Please be serious, father. This is a serious matter.”</p>\n<p>“I’m serious,” Shuro the patriarch frowned. “And shredded coconut is a serious matter too!”</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura took a deep breath. Getting emotional over her father’s stupidity would only complicate the conversation.</p>\n<p>“Did you really hear the nickname they gave you...?” Mila asked him as she massaged her forehead. “It’s toothless Yashura. Toothless!”</p>\n<p>“Who said that?”</p>\n<p>“People.”</p>\n<p>“Fuck them people,” Shuro said. He never heard those old fogies calling him “toothless”, so he reckoned young'uns were the ones who came up with that. He sighed. For them to call this patriarch who always held the title of the best cook in Badril Village, those young people really didn’t have a good sense in them.</p>\n<p>“Because there’s Uncle Jhuro’s watching us from behind as a patriarch you can be toothless incompetent all you want, father, but--”</p>\n<p>“Oi, mind your words!”</p>\n<p>“--But!” Mila asserted despite her father started to pout after being called an incompetent, “but my generation is going to be harsh. No one as skilled and as strong as Uncle Jhuro appeared in the young’uns to be the guardian lion as our emblem is supposed to be.”</p>\n<p>“That is maybe but what are you trying to say here?”</p>\n<p>“What I’m saying is Shira can’t afford to be another toothless patriarch. You’re a support class, father, a <b>Specialist</b> like me. In our Badril Village history no matter how great your cooking is and no matter how wide our connections are if a conflict to arise a support class as a patriarch, nobody’d take us seriously--that is, unless another Unique Class who can afford to stay here in the village appears to scare them annoying people.”</p>\n<p>“Hoo, it seems you’ve been using your head a lot recently. That’s quite surprising.”</p>\n<p>Mila pursed her lips.</p>\n<p>“Unlike a certain carefree toothless patriarch, me and most family members concerned about Shira’s progress stuck as a Level 3 Novice. And what’s more, that girl Bhela Malikh--I don’t like what she did with her hair.”</p>\n<p>“Her hair?”</p>\n<p>“She cut her hair short. I confirmed it myself.”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro shook his head. He knew what his daughter was worrying about. “Girl, nephew Bhela has been away from the village and our dull way of thinking. She had been living with people in different cultures and customs these past two years. Maybe she cut her hair because she wants to follow fashion. Like that Aunty Yarly’s girl who suddenly has her lips red with lip balms, see? The young'uns are always doing it whenever foreigners come bringing their latest fads with them. You’re thinking too much.”</p>\n<p>“Why does everyone think Bhela Malikh is just some brainless girl who doesn’t know what she’s doing?” Mila Yashura frowned. “She’s smart, father. Even Shira knows she’s smart. You know what Shira said when I told him her fiancée has short hair now?--”</p>\n<p>She smirked.</p>\n<p>“--He said, ‘the engagement’s not going to work’.”</p>\n<p>“Bah! He’s been saying that shit for years!”</p>\n<p>“I know, I know!” Mila said. “But this time he’s serious. He said that with a punchable face as if he was saying ‘see, I told you’. His face looked punchable, I tell ya!”</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura was genuinely angry. This time, Patriarch Shuro Yashura didn’t immediately reply. He looked at his daughter, scratched his head, said, “So, in short, you worried about we can’t do nothing if Bhela is serious about cutting her hair to state her stance on her own engagement?”</p>\n<p>“Well, yeah! Of course I am. Only widows who cut hairs like that!”</p>\n<p>“You think it’s because she doesn’t like being paired with our Shira who is much weaker than her?”</p>\n<p>“Well, duh, old man, you’re still asking the obvious?”</p>\n<p>“Then don’t worry, look again at his status,” Shuro Yashura tossed back the status window back to his daughter. Its lifespan hasn't yet expired, so it was still showing Shira’s attributes and status as Level 3 Novice. “See what’s wrong in there?”</p>\n<p>Mila opened her mouth, “His combat attributes--”</p>\n<p>“No, look again!” Shuro cut off.</p>\n<p>Despite knitting her eyebrows, Mila still didn’t catch his father’s drift.</p>\n<p>Seeing his daughter had a hard time figuring it out, Shuro Yashura revealed, “His elemental affinity. See?”</p>\n<p>“It’s <b>Water</b> elemental affinity. It’s not that rare. What’s wrong with it?”</p>\n<p>“Well, he’s still a Novice. Getting a class still far away from him.”</p>\n<p>When a person reached the first barrier at Level 10 and got his class, there was a chance for him to aversed in one or more elementals and largely transformed, or perhaps even enhanced, the skills he would get from the class he acquired. Not everyone, but the chance was more than fifty-fifty. Aside from the rare ones, four base elementals that commonly appeared were <b>Fire</b>, <b>Wind</b>, <b>Lightning</b>, and <b>Water</b>--Mila wasn’t sure what so special for her cousin acquired an affinity over one of those base elementals.</p>\n<p>“Have you seen anyone with an elemental affinity in his Novice years?” her father asked.</p>\n<p>“It’s rare…” Mila was unsure, “can’t say I have.”</p>\n<p>“You haven’t. I have,” Shuro Yashura said. “Twenty seven years ago. Your Uncle Jhuro had a huge fight with grandfather and he ran away into the Mossy Forest behind the mountain--for nearly three weeks. He ate wild fruits. He ate monster meat also. But in the last three days he got unlucky and got poisoned by a snake monster ten levels above him. He struggled with death. Alone in that forest. But he lived. The fool then decided the forest was too dangerous for him and he returned back home.”--and got to experience a near-death situation again after their furious father almost pummeled him to pulp, Patriarch Shuro’s memories drifted.</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura listened. She knew the story of how his uncle survived alone in Mossy Forest--it was crazy, a kind of legend for the young’uns today. That was the first story amongst stories about the Badril Village’s last Unique Class warrior--Jhuro Yashura the Blackfang Swordsman--the story that first made him famous in the village for his unordinary bravery and recklessness.</p>\n<p>Shuro Yashura asked her daughter, “You know what happened after that, right?”</p>\n<p>She nodded.</p>\n<p>“Uncle awakened his rare <b>Poison</b> elemental affinity.”</p>\n<p>And Jhuro Yashura wasn’t even reached Level 10 back then.</p>\n<p>There was an unspoken law of the system most people didn’t know. A premonition, or sign, more appropriately, that if a Novice got an elemental before acquiring a class, chance was, an Unique class would be waiting for him.</p>\n<p>“See what I’m getting at?” Shuro Yashura said with a smile. “Time will reveal it, you don’t have to worry. Sooner or later, there’ll be another Unique class in our Yashura Family.”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>That morning the family getting busy preparing for ngajen ceremony; family officials, the servants, even brats too, were busy with their own errands. Usually with a few of copper kobe coins older kids could secretly pass their morning errands to the little ones--as lazier and richer kids like Shira wasn’t foreign to the practice, but unfortunately he couldn’t find some kids to bribe even on days like this. Not that he wasn’t happy about it. The errand his aunt gave him accidentally had something to do in the market, the destination he’d go to sell his painting today anyway.</p>\n<p>“Is it me or someone’s been staring at me since I stepped out of my family’s gate?”</p>\n<p>“It’s not you,” Good-Natured Spirit replied to Shira's question. “It seems the stalker Big-Boobed Sect sent today was particularly sloopy, kinda annoying.”</p>\n<p>“Oh yeah? How many of them are following me?” Shira asked half-heartedly.</p>\n<p>“What? You don’t believe them Big-Boobed Sect always spying on us?”</p>\n<p>Shira shrugged. Good-Natured Spirit was right--the boy didn’t believe his ramblings about all-girl sect always hiding in Badril Village’s shadows, especially with those padded words about them being beautiful and having bountiful bodies. He didn’t believe it because he still got some common sense. Not to mention hidden sects, even some decent clans and schools wouldn’t bother with ordinary places like Badril Village.</p>\n<p>And thus as he had feared, the market was already crowded by then. The moment Shira realized it, Good-Natured Spirit already drifted away by the sight of excitement in gambling dens and beautiful young wives from Elzhier Family sold street foods. As it turned out, it was stamped on the Nalaq’s mind to get off Shira as soon as they came to the market lest the boy’d use him for errands one way or another. The peddler Shira acquainted with was getting a good crowd as he laid his wares behind his wagon.</p>\n<p>“Monkey!”</p>\n<p>The peddler behind the wares turned his head. He had a funny face, a rare trait that made him resemble a monkey. And there was no coincidence everyone called him Monkey. When Monkey slightly wandered his eyes through the crowd and saw Shira, he waved his hands to the grunting customers and told them he’d close his shop for a while.</p>\n<p>“Well, well, isn’t this our Young Master Shira blessing us with his presence?” the smiling Monkey briskly approached as he rubbed his palms excitedly. “Can I help you young master?”</p>\n<p>Shira stepped back when Monkey got too close. “Monkey, you better stop being creepy whenever I come visit you.”</p>\n<p>“You hurt me, young master. There’s nothing creepy about our business relationship.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, it’s your face. Don’t make me regret selling my painting to you.”</p>\n<p>“Haha, surely you jest, Young Master Shira--I’m trying my best to maintain a professional face from now on!” Monkey said that then immediately took a small peek at the content. “Your skill is just getting better and better, master. I’m sure this will sell well, Master!”</p>\n<p>“What’s with the master thing?”</p>\n<p>“How dare for me to call you ‘Young Master’ while you yourself are already an expert at this stage?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t want our relationship getting creepier than it already is,” Shira said, then he took out a pouch of coins. “Anyways, I got an errand from my aunt, so give me the thirteen dried spices worth all this money.”</p>\n<p>“What kind of spice?”</p>\n<p>“All kinds of spices.”</p>\n<p>“Of course, of course, I’ll give you a discount, just to celebrate your improvement in the path of drawing, Master.”</p>\n<p>By the time Shira got himself a basketful of spices, Monkey’s grin getting more annoying. The stereotypical fat and slimy merchants looked innocent compared to him. After Shira threw a frowning glance at him, he <em>reluctantly</em> admitted, “Young master may not know this, but recently I’ve got an Alchemist partner with me who was trying to be independent from his family,” he said. “And I must tell you, young master, this family is a many-hundreds of years Alchemists family, and you also must know he’s not kicked out of incompetente--”</p>\n<p>Shira cut his roundabout pitching. “You want me to back the Alchemist?”</p>\n<p>“Mmm...yes….” Monkey nodded with a wry smile.</p>\n<p>The boy’s eyes wandered through the peddler’s wares before looked at him in the eyes. “Even I must tread through the game of cat and dog with the elders because of the rules,” he explained to Monkey, who in turn, could only smile helplessly.</p>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>Mossack’s custom dictates children who haven’t gone through their coming of age ceremony--usually at the age of sixteen--to not being involved in politics and commerce. This is the reason why Shira--as he mostly acquired money winning through streaks of chess games with Good-Natured Spirit--couldn’t recklessly flaunt his personal wealth in public.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>The risk of having a relationship gone sour with this young master, Monkey knew that. It was unlikely for an upstart peddler to be relied on by a future patriarch of a big family, and he wholeheartedly believed it was unwise to create a trivial misunderstanding with Young Master Shira Yashura. After all, it was only one year until Shira would have his own coming of age ceremony. Therefore, Monkey didn’t want to impose on the Young Master’s kindness too much and quickly changed the topic with something he’d prepared beforehand.</p>\n<p>“This is a <b>Boost Elixir</b> concocted by my partner. He might not a 2nd-Tier Alchemist yet but I assure you, Young Master Shira, the elixir’s potent power won’t lose against any experts you’ll find anywhere!” Monkey said with his over-excited sales pitch, which made him look more funny than usual, “This humble bottle was scientifically proven to increase a person’s level as long as he is below the age of twenty! To date, this Boost Elixir has 100% effectiveness in increasing the user’s level! Young master, you are very lucky--you can have this miraculous elixir just for half of the original price today!”</p>\n<p>Though it was clear Monkey meant no harm, Shira narrowed his eyes at the pedder.</p>\n<p>“Did someone pay you to make me drink it?” he asked suspiciously.</p>\n<p>“You jest again, Young Master… ha ha… haaa….” Monkey awkwardly laughed as he tried to hide his dampened enthusiasm. “Why don’t you try it first, Young Master Shira. You don’t have to pay if you didn’t get to graduate from Level 3 Novice.”</p>\n<p>Eventually, Shira drank the Boost Elixir within a gulp, not because he believed its miraculous effect, but because he was weak for free and discounted goods.</p>\n<p>“Your EXP bar didn’t even budge a little,” Monkey muttered with a meek voice.</p>\n<p>“The liquid is surprisingly well made though. Is this really made by someone you know?”</p>\n<p>“I said before, Young Master. The one who made this hailed from an old Alchemist family that even outside South Tiramikal Kingdom their last name still can be a pretty big deal. I’m pretty confident that--normally--this elixir will have a 100% success rate for leveling up whoever drinks it!”</p>\n<p>“Such a confident boast. Are you perhaps implying that my case is not <em>normally</em>?”</p>\n<p>“He hehe, you surely joke. You know that I don’t mean any harm, young master.”</p>\n<p>Shira of course knew it. And the other thing he also knew, that if it was a really impressive elixir he just drank by now, the usual Monkey wouldn’t utter a single phrase of the word “free”, regardless how many times the elixir failed to deliver its promise.</p>\n<p>Shira looked at Monkey suspiciously, “You’re Monkey, aren’t you? Not someone brainwashed by my family’s enemy or something like that? You know, by vampires.”</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira… now your joke is not even funny--something like a poor peddler to be brainwashed only appears in stories. Vampires are some unfounded folklore.”</p>\n<p>“Monkey I know is stupid. If not brainwashed, then he definitely manipulated to sell a fake elixir to someone from big families.”</p>\n<p>Before Monkey was able to retort that, a cold voice came from the wagon. “Young Master Yashura, I don’t mind if you pinpoint Monkey’s stupidity and make assumptions about him muchever you want. But to call my elixir is fake, I can’t stand and watch around anymore.”</p>\n<p>A man appeared from the wagon Monkey had, had an appearance of the stereotypical scholar Shira had in mind--though, by the way he crossed his arms pompously, he seemed to have a pride worthy of someone hailed from big families.</p>\n<p>“You’re the Alchemist?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, you call me Snake--don’t ask for my real name,” the Alchemist said.</p>\n<p>One would hide his name if he didn’t want to be associated with his family anymore. So Shira didn’t ask. He looked at the scholarly Alchemist, then at the peddler. One was the Snake and the other one was the Monkey.</p>\n<p>Shira found some sort of strange camradice between them. “I see, so both of you decided to be a partner for life.”</p>\n<p>“Not for life, no. Spare me. It’s better for me to ditch this stupid ape as soon as he outlives his usefulness.”</p>\n<p>“Heey! Don’t say ditching in front of me!” Monkey protested. Snake ignored him without pretense, making the impression that this scene was ordinary for them.</p>\n<p>Shira then asked Snake straightforwardly.</p>\n<p>“What kind of elixir is this?”</p>\n<p>“Didn’t Monkey tell you? A Boost Elixir. My latest masterpiece,” Snake replied.</p>\n<p>“You’re aware that your partner tried to sell your masterpiece at a half price, right? I don’t even have to pay, it was what he said before.”</p>\n<p>“It was my idea,” Snake said. “This is a simple business hack. I’m confident about my concoctions. After all, I experimented heavily on human anatomy--too heavy, even, to the point folks in my family want me gone for good. I’ve got nothing to lose here. That bottle is a prototype; it cost a lot so I planned to price it a lot.”</p>\n<p>“You want to use my bad reputation as a stepping stone, don’t you?” Shira asked with a sour smile.</p>\n<p>“Yes. Do you mind?”</p>\n<p>“No, I’d gladly make profit out of those trash talking they did behind my back--though, it seems you picked the wrong guinea pig to be your mascot for your ‘business hack’,” Shira said with a wry smile.</p>\n<p>Monkey nodded weakly. As a peddler from outside the village, he was always bothered by how nasty rumors could be, especially with some acquaintance he depended on sometimes as an important business partner.</p>\n<p>Seeing that they no longer had things to chat about, Shira said to them he’d consider putting some resources if he managed to gain some nod from the family elders after he went through the coming-of-age ceremony next year. And now that he finished selling Good-Natured Spirit’s rejected commision and completed the errand his aunt gave him, Shira then bid farewell to the two animal-nicknamed gentlemen.</p>\n<p>“Please wait, Young Master Shira.”</p>\n<p>Shira turned back his head again and found Snake, the one who called him, ran back to Monkey’s wagon to grab something.</p>\n<p>“Try to drink this one,” Snake said after trotting back hurriedly. “It’s alright, you don’t have to pay for this time too.”</p>\n<p>The current elixir Snake took out was the exact opposite from the previous one. Its container was beautiful and high-class, but the content was muddy and very low in quality. Hearing that this one was also free, Shira didn’t hesitate to drink it.</p>\n<p>The after taste was incredibly sour. Unlike any other bitter concocted elixirs or potions he ever drank. Although not much, Shira could feel his body warming up. He was surprised at the unexpected reaction.</p>\n<p>“Oohhhh!!!” Monkey cried as his eyes glued at Shira’s Status Window. “The EXP bar moved!”</p>\n<p>“What?” the surprised Shira glanced at Snake and asked slowly, “This one’s free, right?”</p>\n<p>It was in a single flash Shira did catch a strange dumbfoundedness in Snake eyes, like the result even came more shocking than him than either of Shira and Monkey. Yet the moment after he promptly regained his stoic exposure, then said to Shira, “Don’t worry, I don’t plan to take back my words,”</p>\n<p>The odd Alchemist put his hands at his back and walked back to his wagon. Before he climbed the wagon, he once again glanced at Shira, looking in a state of half-disbelief like expression</p>\n<p>As Snake disappeared into the wagon, Shira and Monkey exchanged glances.</p>\n<p>“He still has that kind of face even though he promises it to be free? You sure do have an odd friend.” Shira said.</p>\n<p>Monkey grinned. “Though an oddball, I never seen anyone with more talent in alchemy than him, like, ever.”</p>\n<p>After leaving Monkey to continue his stall, Shira saw Good-Natured Spirit again when he visited a food stall not far from Monkey’s wagon. He asked what he was doing, and the Nalaq told him there was a fool who bet a lot and won a lot in the gambling games. To lose against in gambling against someone with Good-Natured Spirit’s caliber, really--Shira sighed--he couldn’t wait for his coming-of-age ceremony next year so he too could farm on these gullible people in some friendly matches--just like what he did with Good-Natured Spirit for this past one year.</p>\n<p>“You know,” munching on some satays he bought from the market, Shira muttered when he headed home along with Good-Natured Spirit, “just then I drank this elixir that really could boost my EXP a little. I don’t know how the guy concocts it, but I have the feeling that I just drink some very expensive elixir for free.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, yeah?”</p>\n<p>On the way back to Yashura Family Shira told the Nalaq spirit about the Alchemist and his elixirs. He also told him that his status that usually wouldn’t react to normal elixirs this time moved a bit after he drank a strange low-quality elixir.</p>\n<p>“That Alchemist must be a nerd to be that sharp,” Good-Natured Spirit said as he floated lazily beside the boy.</p>\n<p>“He looks like that too. The peddler he partnered with also has some good sense in him. So I thought it’s not a loss for me to use all those foreign coins I got from you to invest on them for the next year.”</p>\n<p>“Hmm,” Good-Natured Spirit crossed his arms. “I think you should be worried.”</p>\n<p>“Worried? Why?”</p>\n<p>“You said that nerd Alchemist was the one who pushed that low-quality elixir to you, right?”</p>\n<p>“I got to drink that for free,” Shira emphasized.</p>\n<p>“He realized one little secret about you then,” Good-Natured Spirit said.</p>\n<p>Shira stopped walking. He looked at him with his head tilted.</p>\n<p>“What secret?”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit who floated before, spoke again.</p>\n<p>“You shouldn’t worry about it too much for now, brat. But, I advise you, if you are still holding dear for your lazy, peaceful village life, you should turn back and kill him right now.”</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-1/chapter-2":"<p>Dinner at Malikh Family; the family hall bustling with relatives who wanted to celebrate Bhela Malikh’s return. Even though the expensive Ngajen Ceremony drew near a good number of ducks and a goat were butchered along with their spice reserves taken out. There were laughters, there lots of people wanted to get on the good side of the only Young Lady of Malikh Family.</p>\n<p>But Bhela’s face was straight the whole time. Given choices, she’d rather have a small dinner with her mother and sick father right now.</p>\n<p>“I heard you went to Elzhier’s training facility as soon as you arrived, young lady,” a bald elder said with big smile. “That is no good. You just return home after four days of traveling. You must have a good rest first.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you for your concern, Elder Jhamil.”</p>\n<p>Bhela had experience with people during her two years abroad to know the meaning of smiles like Elder Jhamil’s--the kind of smile that didn’t reach eyes, the fake kind of smile. She always found it was uncomfortable whenever she met with one. Yet what was more uncomfortable was the fact she was the star of the party. Flatteries and congratulations flowing in. Bhela kept nodding her head and had a smiling expression on her face. No one really had a good time beside the ignorant families who came to find abundant foods to eat.</p>\n<p>Finally toward the end of the big dinner Elder Jhamil gave a few speeches and led everyone for their patriarch's health. Bhela hadn’t come home for two years, but she was alert enough to know the popular opinion going around inside the Malikh Family. She knew her father was disliked by many because the engagement he set up more than a dozen years ago, back when she wasn’t even able to speak yet, back when the Malikhs didn’t think much of it and didn’t know the girl back then would grow splendidly into a fair Young Lady. What she didn’t expect was that, Elder Jhamil, would point it out in front of other family members.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady, I’m sure you’re aware about it by now, but the one from Yashura Family is still stuck on the same level from back when you were leaving for your seminars.”</p>\n<p>“I’m aware, yes,” she said. “And?”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil smiled dryly at the question, he said, “With a partner that lazy he’d drag you sooner or later, wouldn’t he? Especially with special talent as yours, many would have second thoughts. But then how about you? Are you fine with that, Young Lady?”</p>\n<p>Bhela didn’t immediately say what was on her mind. She quietly picked the warm ginger drink they served her, drank it, while her eyes glanced at a certain direction where two maidservants who immediately glanced down the moment her eyes came into contact with theirs.</p>\n<p>Seeing that Bhela wasn’t that responsive with the idea, Elder Jhamil spoke further, “Young Lady, don’t worry, we as Malikhs only worried about your future. If you feel injustice in your heart, you must be brave, you must voice it out to your parents, Young Lady Bhela--all of us Malikhs support you for whichever path you choose! Isn’t that right, everyone?”</p>\n<p>“That’s right!” someone shouted. Then came more rougher voice--</p>\n<p>“We don’t fear those Yashura’s retaliation, Young Lady. You don’t have to be afraid they’ll come here to bully us because of that trash from Yashura Family!”</p>\n<p>“We support you, Young Lady!”</p>\n<p>“Don’t be afraid!”</p>\n<p>The dry smile on Elder Jhamil turned elated when people were chanting along with his cue. It was only when Bhela slowly put down the warm glass of ginger drink in her hand did they stop making ruckus, everyone was waiting for what Bhela was going to say next.</p>\n<p>“I think,” Bhela said with the remarkable cold expression of hers, “any engagement in the main family should be the main family’s business only.”</p>\n<p>She stopped. Not a single more soul dared to send her further flatteries until dinner was over. Even the bald Elder Jhamil, the most enthusiastic of all them, quietly sat back where he belonged.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>“Ah, young lady, please wait, Young Lady Bhela!” the bald Elder Jhamil chased her, trotting, with a box in his hands.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh frowned upon hearing the voice. But she hid her expression well as turned around and asked, “Is something the matter, Elder Jhamil?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, in fact, there’s one matter a bit inappropriate to deal in the family hall,” as soon as Elder Jhamil said that, he opened the box he carried. It was a dress. “It’s something that I get from a merchant who has a lot of dealing with people in the west. He told me this is apparently the current popular fashion for western nobles. I think it’s good for Young Lady.”</p>\n<p>Bhela studied Elder Jhamil’s expression. If the dress truly was a fashionable goods then the elder ought to have paid a quite of coins to get this. As far as Bhela Malikh remembered, Elder Jhamil she knew wasn’t this kind even when her father the patriarch married. Naturally with such an expensive homecoming gift, Bhela was alerted.</p>\n<p>“Thank you for your kindness, Elder Jhamil. Bhela will treasure this well.”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, you don’t have to mention it, Young Lady Bhela,” Elder Jhamil said with a laugh. Then, while rubbing his palms unconsciously, the bald elder began to smile--not a fake one like he usually did have, a genuine smile, one that reflected his current emotion--the smile of greed. “By the way, young lady,” he continued, “I heard you getting along well with the Young Master from the noble Blackwood Family during your time away…”</p>\n<p>“Young Lady of Blackwood Family is my friend,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“Yeah but… I also heard in the next ngajen ceremony, Young Master Blackwood would grace us with his presence… is that true?”</p>\n<p>“I wouldn’t know.”</p>\n<p>“Hehe,” Elder Jhamil chuckled knowingly. “I think things would go well if you wear that dress during ngajen ceremony, young lady.”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh said a short and ambiguous reply and tried to get away from the bald elder. After she escaped in the lone corridor, she took out the dress from the box. The said dress was glimmering under the torchlight, yet, in spite of that, Bhela wasn’t happy the slightest bit.</p>\n<p>“This kind of thing…”</p>\n<p>A proper dress for ladies of southern people was hiding everything below the collarbone. Showing more, akin to invite men to do something indecent. Bhela wasn’t a conservative to follow Mossack customes down rigidly as shown from her cutting her hair short despite the gesture usually reserved for unavailable widows. But still, something like decency of girlhood, was something even someone duller than Bhela should have. Even daring courtesans would think twice to wear this kind of provocative dress to attend a festivity made by the Mossack majority.</p>\n<p>It was distasteful. Bhela didn’t want to think too much about it. After putting back the dress, Bhela walked again to the east wing of Malikh Family where her father was resting.</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim Malikh’s sick room once used as the family’s <b>Alchemist</b> workplace. It had long been vacant, thus usually used to care sick and injured people, as it had the most complete medicinal facility in the entire Malikh Family. Upon entering the room, Bhela found the thick pungent of herbs made her head light. And still she was amazed by how loyal her mother was to taking care of her father closely when servants would need to take a breather of fresh air ten minutes inside the sick room.</p>\n<p>“Father, mother, I’m back…. Did they send some food here?”</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh, the mother, was the one who replied to Bhela. “They did. Some people might forget about the patriarch’s little family but there are still good aunties working in the kitchen,” a middle-aged woman said with a hint of sadness, helplessness, and resentment.</p>\n<p>“Does mother want some hot tea? I’ll go fetch and say my thanks for those good aunties,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“You girl, sit down. You just returned today, now you want to run around doing errands?” Madam Malikh smiled weakly. “How’s the village, dear? Does it change from the way you remembered?”</p>\n<p>“Somes changed, others stay the same, mother,” Bhela said. She got to the table and put the box Elder Jhamil gifted, then took it off her mind. She then picked a random book from the shelves. “Can I stay here for a while?” she asked while showing the book to her mother, telling her the intention that she was going to read it there.</p>\n<p>The mother’s smile turned strained. At noon, she purposely told this daughter of hers to see around the village because she was afraid, if Bhela spent too much time in this room, she would feel uncomfortable by the thick medicinal smell and grow to hate the idea of staying. Even some maidservants a few years older than her were fidgeting and eyeing for the door every time they had duty to bring a meal here. Yet, looking from her daughter’s unflinching eyes, Madam Malikh was relented in the end.</p>\n<p>“Sit here,” the mother offered her chair for her daughter, while she sat down on the edge of her husband’s bed.</p>\n<p>Bhela’s moved with small, noiseless steps, trying not to wake up her father. But it was unfortunate that her father woke up nonetheless.</p>\n<p>“Le… letter…”</p>\n<p>The quivering voice escaped his cracking dry lips.</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh wanted to retort. Not the letter again. No matter how many times she read it aloud he still thirst for the letter as if it was the only salvation left for his life. Nonetheless, she surrendered and she picked a smooth, white paper made from wood--the kind which was expensive and usually used overseas--and began to read its content.</p>\n<p>“I understand your situation. But sending help from where I am takes a while. Ask Yulong’s help for now.”</p>\n<p>As if the letter was his assurance, Patriarch Ghalim Malikh closed his eyes again.</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at her mother who folded the recently opened letter, she asked. “Whose letter is that?”</p>\n<p>“Your great-grandmother who lived overseas,” her mother said.</p>\n<p>“I see.” Bhela wasn’t sure which relative her mother mentioned, but she decided to ask something else seeing her mother’s bad mood. “Why Great-grandmother mentioned something about Yulong? Isn’t Yulong the Yashura Family’s butler, mother?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know, I reckon she told us to rely on Yashura Family instead.”</p>\n<p>The strained smile on her mother’s face made Bhela realize that even her mother was reluctant when Yashura Family was mentioned. As a mother, she loved Bhela dearly, and was the one to believe in her daughter before everyone else. She believed in her daughter’s future. That was why she was first to oppose Bhela’s engagement when the sour rumors about the heir of the Yashura Family started. Never would she expect that her Malikh Family would be in dire straits so suddenly they needed Yashura Family’s help to get them out of this mess.</p>\n<p>“Have you sent someone to inform Yulong, mother?” Bhela asked.</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh shook her head. Bhela reckoned with Elder Jhamil gaining influence so fast, her mother wouldn’t know anyone to trust in this kind of situation.</p>\n<p>The girl then gave her mother a glass of water to ease her down. “I’ll let him know then,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Dear,” Madam Malikh brushed her daughter’s hair as she smiled helplessly, “showing your face in Yashura Family might complicate things…”</p>\n<p>Bhela patted her mother’s hands and assured her, “Don’t worry, mother,” she said, “I’ll ask favors from people I know from Elzhier Family.”</p>\n<p>Bhela thought her parents would go along with her arrangement. Madam Malikh hung open her lips as if she wanted to say something, but then she tightened her smile in the end. Unexpectedly, it was a weak voice that disagreed instead.</p>\n<p>“Bhela… don’t...” her father whispered weakly.</p>\n<p>“Dear?” mother leaned on toward his mouth.</p>\n<p>“What is it, father?” Bhela, too, leaned closer.</p>\n<p>“Don’t… ask… don’t… favor… purple...” the sickly patriarch’s voice turned hoarse and defragmented before he completed his sentences. Bhela and her mother quickly shushed him, they couldn’t afford to see the sick father forcing himself with this condition. Even after two minutes, he still struggled to tell his words to his daughter. Though eventually he fell to slumber by himself after his wife tried to put him to sleep with her eyes wet with tears.</p>\n<p>Beside her mother, Bhela picked a bamboo fan and used it to make a breeze for her father’s sleep to be more comfortable. Her expression was flat and straight the entire time, but inside, she was disturbed by the words her father failed to tell her.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>For as long as the Yashuras knew him, their Young Master Shira Yashura lived alone in his house. The only other person who should’ve been living here, his father, didn’t come home for months already. So ever since his uncle let him live in his house a few years back, Shira enjoyed an independent lifestyle he’d take for granted one of these days.</p>\n<p>At night, his schedule often filled with working on painting commissions Good-Natured Spirit gave him. Which, unfortunately, not something he wished for people to know. This part of his schedule was one of his secrets, if known by a certain meddlesome cousin, hell would surely be waiting for him.</p>\n<p>“I told you again and again,” a voice from behind him blurted, “you should’ve shown the boobs a little more.”</p>\n<p>Shira turned his head and groaned when he found the Nalaq’s annoying face a little bit too close. “Can you knock the door first?”</p>\n<p>“No way. I came through the wall. Door? What is door? Never use the thing since ages ago.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t creep up from behind, then. At least preserve your dignity as a Nalaq.”</p>\n<p>“I told you, don’t call me Nalaq,” Good-Natured Spirit hissed. “Anyway, boobs! The bweebs!! Make it more sexy! More bold and open!”</p>\n<p>“That’s not what we agreed on,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“Just a little, man. A little dot--tiny nipply dot--that’s all I’m asking for.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t push it, old man.”</p>\n<p>“Ah! You’re not fun anymore,” Good-Natured Spirit moaned in disatisfaction. In addition of Nalaq, Good-Natured Spirit was never fond of being called old. He died in his early thirty. So he retained the look, and he--according to himself--was still as handsome as ever. “Ah, forget it,” he waved his hand lazily. “Your drawings are second-rate porns anyway.”</p>\n<p>“You’re not paying for this one again?” Shira asked.</p>\n<p>“Not this one. Too safe. Don’t want it. At least make her boobs and butt bigger for the next time.”</p>\n<p>Shira sighed and wrapped it up for tonight. Everytime Good-Natured Spirit cancelled the commission's Shira wouldn’t have any choice but selling the paintings half-baked to a peddler he knew. Not even a half price, he’d be lucky if the rejected paintings would sell even one-fifth from Good-Natured Spirit’s usual payment.</p>\n<p>While Shira was tidying up his room, Good-Natured Spirit looked at the lady in the painting. The Nalaq said, “Hmm. I gotta say, man, despite your second-rate skill you’re natural when it comes to drawing faces. Especially the eyes. How should I say this… those aren’t the eyes of cheap bitches usually have, I tell you.”</p>\n<p>Shira didn’t know whether he should feel flattered or not. After he tidied the room and hid the naughty painting carefully, he prepared to go to sleep.</p>\n<p>“Oh, by the way,” Good-Natured Spirit said as Shira changed his shirt, “I’ve checked on your girl, brat. She’s a real good beauty, alright. Her talent too is not to be scoffed at. And also--boobs.”</p>\n<p>Shira glanced at him with tightened brows. “I’ll be troubled if they somehow trace it back to me in case the Young Lady of Malikh Family was assaulted.”</p>\n<p>“Hehe, relax man, I’ll never touch my buddy’s chick. We’re buddies, aren’t we?”</p>\n<p>Shira wanted to say no but he felt it’d be better for him not to comment on that. He then hurriedly kicked out the Nalaq so he could get some sleep in peace.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In almost all of Mossack race traditions, ngajen ceremony held monthly in villages near a mountain. It was one of those legacy of ancient Mossack that still around simply because of its practice brought safety to the people. Originally was a session of prayers and offerings to calm down Selaqs which dwelling on the mountains--they had to, because many stories being passed down in every families that even ancient tribe chieftains and heroes couldn’t do nothing if waves of Selaqs rampaged over the southern lands. Though, as the cost of ceremony getting more expensive as the time went on and getting more political, nowadays it became a time of feasts for big families to assert their surrounding influence. And a time of feasts where small and independent families gained side incomes from providing food and good for the big families’ feats. Ngajen ceremony was also the main reason why there was a weird rule for every Mossack-rooted families, tribes, and clans, that saying the leaders must be someone of a great cook--the majority of them were simply foodies.</p>\n<p>“And thus, Shira my boy--” the patriarch said as he played with his thick moustache, “--us southern people are naturally different from those imperialist western Haldeens and those warmongers feudalists of eastern Kaya. We don’t simply become leaders because of our noble bloodlines or merits and achievements in battle but simply because of food. This is an important lesson, my boy: no matter one hails from a noble blood or being a simple commoner, no matter one’s an enemy or ally, in the end, everyone’s going to eat happily and peacefully when we southern cooks shove foods up in their mouths. Remember that.”</p>\n<p>Shira Yashura quietly nodded. He didn’t plan to learn cooking from the start but, as the heir of Yashura Family, spending effort on foods probably one of the most important lessons before he became the next Patriarch of Yashura Family.</p>\n<p>“So you understand. Good. Sooner or later you’ll understand being strong is not everything, having talent is not everything,” the patriarch said. “Look at your father, for instance. He’s the only one in Badril Village who has an Unique class since… I don’t know, many many years. He’s pretty badass, eh? But why is that the one who ended up being the patriarch was me?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, Uncle Shuro, please do tell me.”</p>\n<p>Shuro Yashura, the patriarch uncle, smiled as he looked at his obedient nephew. He then half-bragging said, “Because he can only boil water, that’s why. Cooking is a great heritage of our ancestors thus those who have no talent on it as to be satisfied with being a second-rate Mossack. The only reason why people like me always ended up becoming the leader of clans because we Mossack appreciate food to a very high degree. Justice is food. Food is justice. With great cooking comes great responsibility.”</p>\n<p>But from the side a sour voice butted in, “Ohh. You’ll never know how much bullshit my father made up just now.”</p>\n<p>Uncle and nephew turned their heads to see a daughter pop her head from the window. Apparently, Mila Yashura had just returned from doing morning errands.</p>\n<p>“What are you guys doing anyway?” she asked. Apparently, in the kitchen, she saw her father and cousin shredding a ridiculous amount of coconuts. No one else was here in the kitchen, so Mila asked, “Did you two really do these by all yourselves?”</p>\n<p>“Of course,” her father, the revered patriarch, said as his hand vigorously shredded coconut. He couldn’t hide the annoying proud smile on his mustache filled face.</p>\n<p>“Since dawn?” Mila asked again suspiciously.</p>\n<p>“Food is justice. Justice is food. With great cooking comes great responsibility. Shredding coconut is one of the fundamental lessons for Shira to become a great patriarch in the future.”</p>\n<p>“Well,” Mila commented, “that’s dumb.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, girl! What do you know? You know nothing about the important philosophy behind every essence of coconuts,” Shuro Yashura exploded. “Since you a girl who don’t have to lead the family then probably you’ll never understand. You’ll never have to understand the hidden substance of every food you’ve eaten! Almost every Mossack delicacies made with coconuts. That Bulayak Satay sauce you like so much is made with coconut milk as a base! And don’t forget goat stew! And baked shredded coconuts cookies! And rendang! You name it. Coconuts have been granted us with delicious foods ever since ancestors were hunters-gatherers! Our very roots of being the descendants of ancient Mossack race can be traced as long as one ponder the mystery behind every shred of coconuts! Look at ancient empires! The ancient Aratararadararam Empire, for an instance, five thousands years ago, formed their empire solely by cultivating lots of coconut trees! They’re building civilizations relying only on the blessing of coconuts! That’s how great coconuts are! Only us who were born to lead our very empire can understand how miraculous are to be feeling joyous in pondering the great essence of shredded coconuts. You don’t know this much then you’re a dumb girl, eh. What a waste of a daughter you are!!” After taking a deep breath, Patriarch Shuro snorted at his impudent daughter, then glanced at Shira, smiling. “Isn’t that right, Shira my boy?”</p>\n<p>That was dumb. Even Shira knew that much. Because of that he kept his head hung low and focused on his task of shredding coconuts, pretending not to hear the question coming at him.</p>\n<p>“See?” the patriarch smirked. “He’s too absorbed by the grace of shredding coconuts he doesn’t notice my words.”</p>\n<p>Mila rolled her eyes, began to ignore her father. “Anyway, Shira! Have you heard the story about that girl Malikh beating up the best Archer kid single-handedly?”</p>\n<p>Shira of course knew about the archery duel that happened yesterday. Because Yashura Family and Malikh Family were entangled in a planned marriage, almost everyone in Yashura Family--including servants and clueless children--were talking about it. Yet he couldn’t raise his head and answer. Do that, and his uncle Shuro would know he only pretended to be interested in shredding coconuts. He’d only hurt his uncle’s feelings that way. Thus, in spite of Mila being overly loud today, all Shira needed to do was shredding and shredding and sometimes stopped to feel the shredded coconuts with his fingers, releasing a solemn sigh, as if he found something profound in every fiber of shredded coconuts.</p>\n<p>“That’s my boy, you understand all too well after all,” Shuro Yashura nodded in satisfaction. He was relieved his successor could be that enlightened by the grace of shredded coconuts. He then glared at his own blood daughter, who supposed to be the princess of the family, nagging so loudly that she stood in borderline of being a tomboy girl and a fussy aunty.</p>\n<p>“Oh, man, just leave him alone, would ya? Just think how many years for him to catch up with his girl--the more you hold him back the more people talk shit about him, father!”</p>\n<p>“Please dear! Is that how you talk with your father? I’m not holding him back, okay?” Patriarch Shuro Yashura then asked Shira, “do I hold you back, Shira my boy?”</p>\n<p>Shira further lowered his head and pretended not to hear that as if he was a turtle.</p>\n<p>“Better be careful. He’s too deep in coconuts he doesn’t even hear me,” the patriarch gave his daughter a glare.</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura rolled her eyes. She crouched and disappeared from the window view, then stood up again a moment later. Her hand clutching a pebble.</p>\n<p>The patriarch gawked, “Oi, what are you--”</p>\n<p>Mila aimed the pebble at Shira and it hit his head with an audible knock.</p>\n<p>“Thousands of gods!” Shira swore.</p>\n<p>“Too deep my ass,” Mila sneered. Unlike her father, she knew too well whenever Shira playing dumb.</p>\n<p>“What do you want?” Shira asked as he rubbed his head.</p>\n<p>“Let’s train your sword skill. You don’t want to face your fiancée with that crappy skill of yours, do you?”</p>\n<p>Shira glanced at his uncle unwillingly. “Do I have to meet with Bhela in her Family?”</p>\n<p>“That’s right, Shira my boy. You rarely visit other houses during ngajen ceremony but old folks from the Elder Council think this is a good time to show Malikh Family our good will,” Shuro Yashura said. “Remember to pray for their patriarch’s health too. He’s your father best friend, after all.”</p>\n<p>As if waiting for Patriarch Shuro’s completed his words, the door of the kitchen knocked at the very moment. A tall gray-haired old man entered. He had a posture that was straight and sharp, classy western-style butler uniform that hadn’t had looked worn out in spite no tailors around to know how to sew the said uniform, and his hand was balanced to hold a tray with a dozen elixirs on top of it with his left hand fingers, while his right hand rested on his back as if he followed an etiquette stranger to most of the villagers. He was the sole butler in Yashura Family--and perhaps, the only butler that ever employed in Badril VIllage.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira, this month’s elixirs your father sent for you have arrived,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Thank you, Yulong.”</p>\n<p>As usual, Shira drank elixirs his father sent abroad without a rest. The content was painfully bitter, thank goodness Yulong provided brown sugars for the boy to nibble after he drank those. His father Jhuro Yashura said--in a letter from abroad--that the elixirs were some kind of nutrient custom-made only for Shira, were expensive, so they could only afford them every one or two months.</p>\n<p>“How do you feel, Shira my boy?”</p>\n<p>Shira said as he munched a brown sugar to dismiss the bitter after taste. “Uh-hm. Better?”</p>\n<p>The family always thought they were a level-boost potion, Jhuro once sent a potion that could increase Shira’s level up to Level 3 in a single gulp after all. But the elixirs seemed to do nothing other than let Shira sleep comfortably at night. Still, his relatives, especially Mila, put their hopes on the resourceful Jhuro Yashura to nurture his own son--the heir of Yashura Family.</p>\n<p>Seeing the lack of enthusiasm in his nephew’s eyes, Patriarch Shuro laughed and said, “Haha. If those don’t work on your progress problems, don’t let it bother you! Your father worked very hard as an instructor in second-rank school and he’d definitely send a better elixir, like that one from three years ago!”</p>\n<p>“Oh,” Shira nodded. The elixir from three years ago was special. He knew it the moment he drank the potion. The warm feeling surrounding his manasphere was special, as with only drinking from one bottle, he leveled up 2 levels overnight.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>After that his uncle let him go out of the kitchen, since it was promised that Shira would do errands for his aunt every morning.</p>\n<p>When he was heading off for his duty, Shira Yashura got pranked by Good-Natured Spirit in the hallway, popped out his head from a wall and cried, “Boo!”--which Shira ignored because Yulong the butler was walking behind him.</p>\n<p>Yulong said with a polite baritone voice of his, “Young Master Shira, do you perhaps would visit the peddler today?”</p>\n<p>Shira looked at the butler. The matter about him doing business with a peddler wasn’t known to the family; but since Yulong wasn’t a Yashura and had been taking care of him since little, he eventually knew about the few investment deals that Shira never talked about. After collecting his thoughts, the boy replied to Yulong’s question, “Depends on the errand I receive, really. My aunt still hasn’t given my errands this morning,” the boy said.</p>\n<p>“I see, Patriarch Shuro took your time since early morning, so if madam doesn’t take pity for you then young master would finish today’s morning errands a little too late.”</p>\n<p>“The market would be too crowded if that happened,” Shira lamented. It couldn’t be helped. Boys and girls around ages of nine and sixteen--before they received coming-of-age ceremony--had to finish several trivial tasks each morning from both parents. It was a custom mainly to educate filial piety, though some smart parents and big family policies would give errands for the young’uns to make them do things that were beneficial for their futures, like street smarts and forming their own social circles outside the playmates they met everyday. Because his mother wasn’t here since he was a baby, and his father never came home for months, it was his aunt who always gave him errands.</p>\n<p>“Young Master,” Yulong stopped him again, “I’m glad for Young Master taking initiatives to improve your life. You grow too fast for this old butler to look after you. But as a child stepping into the adult world, please let me give you a small advice.”</p>\n<p>“I’m all ears, Yulong.”</p>\n<p>Yulong said, “You cannot guarantee everyone’s nature all around you, Young Master. Especially those who come approaching you with impure motives. I hope Young Master understands this, and to not make friends with nasty people.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit, who was around, snorted.</p>\n<p>Shira pretended he didn’t hear the Nalaq and nodded at the butler’s words. “You don’t have to worry about the peddler. Even though he’s been peddling for two years now, I found the fella got a pretty good sense.”</p>\n<p>“Hearing your words relieves me greatly. Thank you.”</p>\n<p>Afterward, Yulong excused himself as he needed to check the servants’ works for the arrangement of Ngajen Ceremony. The butler unassumingly walked on the side of the corridor, avoiding Good-Natured Spirit who was floating in the way, as if he knew there was something unpleasant floating in the way.</p>\n<p>“So long, fucker,” Good-Natured Spirit flashed his middle finger to Yulong’s back who just passed him by. Of course, the old butler didn’t show any reaction to his insult.</p>\n<p>“Why did you always do that to him?” Shira said to him with a frown.</p>\n<p>“This middle finger?” Good-Natured Spirit asked back.</p>\n<p>“No, the insult.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit grinned.</p>\n<p>“You know nothing about this middle finger, eh? Hehehh heh....”</p>\n<p>Yulong was someone Shira heartily respected. He always used polite language when talking to the butler. Because of that he was irked by the way Good-Natured Spirit sneered.</p>\n<p>“I need to sell the painting you rejected before the market becomes too crowdy. Let’s go,” he said. Bantering with Good-Natured Spirit would only make him more cocky, so Shira held the urge to humor his annoying behavior and headed off to the village’s market.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Back in the kitchen, Mila stayed with his father--who still shredding coconuts--while she read from a see-through board in front of her.</p>\n<p>“Ugh… his experience didn’t even change a single point,” Mila groaned.</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro too engrossed himself in coconut to realize what his daughter was doing just now. “You did a <b>Status Window</b> on him?”</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura nodded. Her face was sour though. “Look at this, old man. See what’s wrong with the number?”</p>\n<p>“Hah, his <b>Dodge Rating</b> getting crazier than before,” Shuro Yashura said with his fingers rubbing his moustache.</p>\n<p>“No! Look, father--his combat attributes, look closely! <b>Strength</b>, <b>Agility</b>, <b>Dexterity</b>! All of them pitifully underdeveloped. And look at the <b>Wisdom</b> attribute now!”</p>\n<p>“Ooh, his Wisdom’s pretty high. I knew his head’s pretty good. No wonder he could ponder the real meaning of shredded coconuts… he’s really a wise kid, after all.”</p>\n<p>“Please be serious, father. This is a serious matter.”</p>\n<p>“I’m serious,” Shuro the patriarch frowned. “And shredded coconut is a serious matter too!”</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura took a deep breath. Getting emotional over her father’s stupidity would only complicate the conversation.</p>\n<p>“Did you really hear the nickname they gave you...?” Mila asked him as she massaged her forehead. “It’s toothless Yashura. Toothless!”</p>\n<p>“Who said that?”</p>\n<p>“People.”</p>\n<p>“Fuck them people,” Shuro said. He never heard those old fogies calling him “toothless”, so he reckoned young'uns were the ones who came up with that. He sighed. For them to call this patriarch who always held the title of the best cook in Badril Village, those young people really didn’t have a good sense in them.</p>\n<p>“Because there’s Uncle Jhuro’s watching us from behind as a patriarch you can be toothless incompetent all you want, father, but--”</p>\n<p>“Oi, mind your words!”</p>\n<p>“--But!” Mila asserted despite her father started to pout after being called an incompetent, “but my generation is going to be harsh. No one as skilled and as strong as Uncle Jhuro appeared in the young’uns to be the guardian lion as our emblem is supposed to be.”</p>\n<p>“That is maybe but what are you trying to say here?”</p>\n<p>“What I’m saying is Shira can’t afford to be another toothless patriarch. You’re a support class, father, a <b>Specialist</b> like me. In our Badril Village history no matter how great your cooking is and no matter how wide our connections are if a conflict to arise a support class as a patriarch, nobody’d take us seriously--that is, unless another Unique Class who can afford to stay here in the village appears to scare them annoying people.”</p>\n<p>“Hoo, it seems you’ve been using your head a lot recently. That’s quite surprising.”</p>\n<p>Mila pursed her lips.</p>\n<p>“Unlike a certain carefree toothless patriarch, me and most family members concerned about Shira’s progress stuck as a Level 3 Novice. And what’s more, that girl Bhela Malikh--I don’t like what she did with her hair.”</p>\n<p>“Her hair?”</p>\n<p>“She cut her hair short. I confirmed it myself.”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro shook his head. He knew what his daughter was worrying about. “Girl, nephew Bhela has been away from the village and our dull way of thinking. She had been living with people in different cultures and customs these past two years. Maybe she cut her hair because she wants to follow fashion. Like that Aunty Yarly’s girl who suddenly has her lips red with lip balms, see? The young'uns are always doing it whenever foreigners come bringing their latest fads with them. You’re thinking too much.”</p>\n<p>“Why does everyone think Bhela Malikh is just some brainless girl who doesn’t know what she’s doing?” Mila Yashura frowned. “She’s smart, father. Even Shira knows she’s smart. You know what Shira said when I told him her fiancée has short hair now?--”</p>\n<p>She smirked.</p>\n<p>“--He said, ‘the engagement’s not going to work’.”</p>\n<p>“Bah! He’s been saying that shit for years!”</p>\n<p>“I know, I know!” Mila said. “But this time he’s serious. He said that with a punchable face as if he was saying ‘see, I told you’. His face looked punchable, I tell ya!”</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura was genuinely angry. This time, Patriarch Shuro Yashura didn’t immediately reply. He looked at his daughter, scratched his head, said, “So, in short, you worried about we can’t do nothing if Bhela is serious about cutting her hair to state her stance on her own engagement?”</p>\n<p>“Well, yeah! Of course I am. Only widows who cut hairs like that!”</p>\n<p>“You think it’s because she doesn’t like being paired with our Shira who is much weaker than her?”</p>\n<p>“Well, duh, old man, you’re still asking the obvious?”</p>\n<p>“Then don’t worry, look again at his status,” Shuro Yashura tossed back the status window back to his daughter. Its lifespan hasn't yet expired, so it was still showing Shira’s attributes and status as Level 3 Novice. “See what’s wrong in there?”</p>\n<p>Mila opened her mouth, “His combat attributes--”</p>\n<p>“No, look again!” Shuro cut off.</p>\n<p>Despite knitting her eyebrows, Mila still didn’t catch his father’s drift.</p>\n<p>Seeing his daughter had a hard time figuring it out, Shuro Yashura revealed, “His elemental affinity. See?”</p>\n<p>“It’s <b>Water</b> elemental affinity. It’s not that rare. What’s wrong with it?”</p>\n<p>“Well, he’s still a Novice. Getting a class still far away from him.”</p>\n<p>When a person reached the first barrier at Level 10 and got his class, there was a chance for him to aversed in one or more elementals and largely transformed, or perhaps even enhanced, the skills he would get from the class he acquired. Not everyone, but the chance was more than fifty-fifty. Aside from the rare ones, four base elementals that commonly appeared were <b>Fire</b>, <b>Wind</b>, <b>Lightning</b>, and <b>Water</b>--Mila wasn’t sure what so special for her cousin acquired an affinity over one of those base elementals.</p>\n<p>“Have you seen anyone with an elemental affinity in his Novice years?” her father asked.</p>\n<p>“It’s rare…” Mila was unsure, “can’t say I have.”</p>\n<p>“You haven’t. I have,” Shuro Yashura said. “Twenty seven years ago. Your Uncle Jhuro had a huge fight with grandfather and he ran away into the Mossy Forest behind the mountain--for nearly three weeks. He ate wild fruits. He ate monster meat also. But in the last three days he got unlucky and got poisoned by a snake monster ten levels above him. He struggled with death. Alone in that forest. But he lived. The fool then decided the forest was too dangerous for him and he returned back home.”--and got to experience a near-death situation again after their furious father almost pummeled him to pulp, Patriarch Shuro’s memories drifted.</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura listened. She knew the story of how his uncle survived alone in Mossy Forest--it was crazy, a kind of legend for the young’uns today. That was the first story amongst stories about the Badril Village’s last Unique Class warrior--Jhuro Yashura the Blackfang Swordsman--the story that first made him famous in the village for his unordinary bravery and recklessness.</p>\n<p>Shuro Yashura asked her daughter, “You know what happened after that, right?”</p>\n<p>She nodded.</p>\n<p>“Uncle awakened his rare <b>Poison</b> elemental affinity.”</p>\n<p>And Jhuro Yashura wasn’t even reached Level 10 back then.</p>\n<p>There was an unspoken law of the system most people didn’t know. A premonition, or sign, more appropriately, that if a Novice got an elemental before acquiring a class, chance was, an Unique class would be waiting for him.</p>\n<p>“See what I’m getting at?” Shuro Yashura said with a smile. “Time will reveal it, you don’t have to worry. Sooner or later, there’ll be another Unique class in our Yashura Family.”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>That morning the family getting busy preparing for ngajen ceremony; family officials, the servants, even brats too, were busy with their own errands. Usually with a few of copper kobe coins older kids could secretly pass their morning errands to the little ones--as lazier and richer kids like Shira wasn’t foreign to the practice, but unfortunately he couldn’t find some kids to bribe even on days like this. Not that he wasn’t happy about it. The errand his aunt gave him accidentally had something to do in the market, the destination he’d go to sell his painting today anyway.</p>\n<p>“Is it me or someone’s been staring at me since I stepped out of my family’s gate?”</p>\n<p>“It’s not you,” Good-Natured Spirit replied to Shira's question. “It seems the stalker Big-Boobed Sect sent today was particularly sloopy, kinda annoying.”</p>\n<p>“Oh yeah? How many of them are following me?” Shira asked half-heartedly.</p>\n<p>“What? You don’t believe them Big-Boobed Sect always spying on us?”</p>\n<p>Shira shrugged. Good-Natured Spirit was right--the boy didn’t believe his ramblings about all-girl sect always hiding in Badril Village’s shadows, especially with those padded words about them being beautiful and having bountiful bodies. He didn’t believe it because he still got some common sense. Not to mention hidden sects, even some decent clans and schools wouldn’t bother with ordinary places like Badril Village.</p>\n<p>And thus as he had feared, the market was already crowded by then. The moment Shira realized it, Good-Natured Spirit already drifted away by the sight of excitement in gambling dens and beautiful young wives from Elzhier Family sold street foods. As it turned out, it was stamped on the Nalaq’s mind to get off Shira as soon as they came to the market lest the boy’d use him for errands one way or another. The peddler Shira acquainted with was getting a good crowd as he laid his wares behind his wagon.</p>\n<p>“Monkey!”</p>\n<p>The peddler behind the wares turned his head. He had a funny face, a rare trait that made him resemble a monkey. And there was no coincidence everyone called him Monkey. When Monkey slightly wandered his eyes through the crowd and saw Shira, he waved his hands to the grunting customers and told them he’d close his shop for a while.</p>\n<p>“Well, well, isn’t this our Young Master Shira blessing us with his presence?” the smiling Monkey briskly approached as he rubbed his palms excitedly. “Can I help you young master?”</p>\n<p>Shira stepped back when Monkey got too close. “Monkey, you better stop being creepy whenever I come visit you.”</p>\n<p>“You hurt me, young master. There’s nothing creepy about our business relationship.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, it’s your face. Don’t make me regret selling my painting to you.”</p>\n<p>“Haha, surely you jest, Young Master Shira--I’m trying my best to maintain a professional face from now on!” Monkey said that then immediately took a small peek at the content. “Your skill is just getting better and better, master. I’m sure this will sell well, Master!”</p>\n<p>“What’s with the master thing?”</p>\n<p>“How dare for me to call you ‘Young Master’ while you yourself are already an expert at this stage?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t want our relationship getting creepier than it already is,” Shira said, then he took out a pouch of coins. “Anyways, I got an errand from my aunt, so give me the thirteen dried spices worth all this money.”</p>\n<p>“What kind of spice?”</p>\n<p>“All kinds of spices.”</p>\n<p>“Of course, of course, I’ll give you a discount, just to celebrate your improvement in the path of drawing, Master.”</p>\n<p>By the time Shira got himself a basketful of spices, Monkey’s grin getting more annoying. The stereotypical fat and slimy merchants looked innocent compared to him. After Shira threw a frowning glance at him, he <em>reluctantly</em> admitted, “Young master may not know this, but recently I’ve got an Alchemist partner with me who was trying to be independent from his family,” he said. “And I must tell you, young master, this family is a many-hundreds of years Alchemists family, and you also must know he’s not kicked out of incompetente--”</p>\n<p>Shira cut his roundabout pitching. “You want me to back the Alchemist?”</p>\n<p>“Mmm...yes….” Monkey nodded with a wry smile.</p>\n<p>The boy’s eyes wandered through the peddler’s wares before looked at him in the eyes. “Even I must tread through the game of cat and dog with the elders because of the rules,” he explained to Monkey, who in turn, could only smile helplessly.</p>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>Mossack’s custom dictates children who haven’t gone through their coming of age ceremony--usually at the age of sixteen--to not being involved in politics and commerce. This is the reason why Shira--as he mostly acquired money winning through streaks of chess games with Good-Natured Spirit--couldn’t recklessly flaunt his personal wealth in public.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>The risk of having a relationship gone sour with this young master, Monkey knew that. It was unlikely for an upstart peddler to be relied on by a future patriarch of a big family, and he wholeheartedly believed it was unwise to create a trivial misunderstanding with Young Master Shira Yashura. After all, it was only one year until Shira would have his own coming of age ceremony. Therefore, Monkey didn’t want to impose on the Young Master’s kindness too much and quickly changed the topic with something he’d prepared beforehand.</p>\n<p>“This is a <b>Boost Elixir</b> concocted by my partner. He might not a 2nd-Tier Alchemist yet but I assure you, Young Master Shira, the elixir’s potent power won’t lose against any experts you’ll find anywhere!” Monkey said with his over-excited sales pitch, which made him look more funny than usual, “This humble bottle was scientifically proven to increase a person’s level as long as he is below the age of twenty! To date, this Boost Elixir has 100% effectiveness in increasing the user’s level! Young master, you are very lucky--you can have this miraculous elixir just for half of the original price today!”</p>\n<p>Though it was clear Monkey meant no harm, Shira narrowed his eyes at the pedder.</p>\n<p>“Did someone pay you to make me drink it?” he asked suspiciously.</p>\n<p>“You jest again, Young Master… ha ha… haaa….” Monkey awkwardly laughed as he tried to hide his dampened enthusiasm. “Why don’t you try it first, Young Master Shira. You don’t have to pay if you didn’t get to graduate from Level 3 Novice.”</p>\n<p>Eventually, Shira drank the Boost Elixir within a gulp, not because he believed its miraculous effect, but because he was weak for free and discounted goods.</p>\n<p>“Your EXP bar didn’t even budge a little,” Monkey muttered with a meek voice.</p>\n<p>“The liquid is surprisingly well made though. Is this really made by someone you know?”</p>\n<p>“I said before, Young Master. The one who made this hailed from an old Alchemist family that even outside South Tiramikal Kingdom their last name still can be a pretty big deal. I’m pretty confident that--normally--this elixir will have a 100% success rate for leveling up whoever drinks it!”</p>\n<p>“Such a confident boast. Are you perhaps implying that my case is not <em>normally</em>?”</p>\n<p>“He hehe, you surely joke. You know that I don’t mean any harm, young master.”</p>\n<p>Shira of course knew it. And the other thing he also knew, that if it was a really impressive elixir he just drank by now, the usual Monkey wouldn’t utter a single phrase of the word “free”, regardless how many times the elixir failed to deliver its promise.</p>\n<p>Shira looked at Monkey suspiciously, “You’re Monkey, aren’t you? Not someone brainwashed by my family’s enemy or something like that? You know, by vampires.”</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira… now your joke is not even funny--something like a poor peddler to be brainwashed only appears in stories. Vampires are some unfounded folklore.”</p>\n<p>“Monkey I know is stupid. If not brainwashed, then he definitely manipulated to sell a fake elixir to someone from big families.”</p>\n<p>Before Monkey was able to retort that, a cold voice came from the wagon. “Young Master Yashura, I don’t mind if you pinpoint Monkey’s stupidity and make assumptions about him muchever you want. But to call my elixir is fake, I can’t stand and watch around anymore.”</p>\n<p>A man appeared from the wagon Monkey had, had an appearance of the stereotypical scholar Shira had in mind--though, by the way he crossed his arms pompously, he seemed to have a pride worthy of someone hailed from big families.</p>\n<p>“You’re the Alchemist?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, you call me Snake--don’t ask for my real name,” the Alchemist said.</p>\n<p>One would hide his name if he didn’t want to be associated with his family anymore. So Shira didn’t ask. He looked at the scholarly Alchemist, then at the peddler. One was the Snake and the other one was the Monkey.</p>\n<p>Shira found some sort of strange camradice between them. “I see, so both of you decided to be a partner for life.”</p>\n<p>“Not for life, no. Spare me. It’s better for me to ditch this stupid ape as soon as he outlives his usefulness.”</p>\n<p>“Heey! Don’t say ditching in front of me!” Monkey protested. Snake ignored him without pretense, making the impression that this scene was ordinary for them.</p>\n<p>Shira then asked Snake straightforwardly.</p>\n<p>“What kind of elixir is this?”</p>\n<p>“Didn’t Monkey tell you? A Boost Elixir. My latest masterpiece,” Snake replied.</p>\n<p>“You’re aware that your partner tried to sell your masterpiece at a half price, right? I don’t even have to pay, it was what he said before.”</p>\n<p>“It was my idea,” Snake said. “This is a simple business hack. I’m confident about my concoctions. After all, I experimented heavily on human anatomy--too heavy, even, to the point folks in my family want me gone for good. I’ve got nothing to lose here. That bottle is a prototype; it cost a lot so I planned to price it a lot.”</p>\n<p>“You want to use my bad reputation as a stepping stone, don’t you?” Shira asked with a sour smile.</p>\n<p>“Yes. Do you mind?”</p>\n<p>“No, I’d gladly make profit out of those trash talking they did behind my back--though, it seems you picked the wrong guinea pig to be your mascot for your ‘business hack’,” Shira said with a wry smile.</p>\n<p>Monkey nodded weakly. As a peddler from outside the village, he was always bothered by how nasty rumors could be, especially with some acquaintance he depended on sometimes as an important business partner.</p>\n<p>Seeing that they no longer had things to chat about, Shira said to them he’d consider putting some resources if he managed to gain some nod from the family elders after he went through the coming-of-age ceremony next year. And now that he finished selling Good-Natured Spirit’s rejected commision and completed the errand his aunt gave him, Shira then bid farewell to the two animal-nicknamed gentlemen.</p>\n<p>“Please wait, Young Master Shira.”</p>\n<p>Shira turned back his head again and found Snake, the one who called him, ran back to Monkey’s wagon to grab something.</p>\n<p>“Try to drink this one,” Snake said after trotting back hurriedly. “It’s alright, you don’t have to pay for this time too.”</p>\n<p>The current elixir Snake took out was the exact opposite from the previous one. Its container was beautiful and high-class, but the content was muddy and very low in quality. Hearing that this one was also free, Shira didn’t hesitate to drink it.</p>\n<p>The after taste was incredibly sour. Unlike any other bitter concocted elixirs or potions he ever drank. Although not much, Shira could feel his body warming up. He was surprised at the unexpected reaction.</p>\n<p>“Oohhhh!!!” Monkey cried as his eyes glued at Shira’s Status Window. “The EXP bar moved!”</p>\n<p>“What?” the surprised Shira glanced at Snake and asked slowly, “This one’s free, right?”</p>\n<p>It was in a single flash Shira did catch a strange dumbfoundedness in Snake eyes, like the result even came more shocking than him than either of Shira and Monkey. Yet the moment after he promptly regained his stoic exposure, then said to Shira, “Don’t worry, I don’t plan to take back my words,”</p>\n<p>The odd Alchemist put his hands at his back and walked back to his wagon. Before he climbed the wagon, he once again glanced at Shira, looking in a state of half-disbelief like expression</p>\n<p>As Snake disappeared into the wagon, Shira and Monkey exchanged glances.</p>\n<p>“He still has that kind of face even though he promises it to be free? You sure do have an odd friend.” Shira said.</p>\n<p>Monkey grinned. “Though an oddball, I never seen anyone with more talent in alchemy than him, like, ever.”</p>\n<p>After leaving Monkey to continue his stall, Shira saw Good-Natured Spirit again when he visited a food stall not far from Monkey’s wagon. He asked what he was doing, and the Nalaq told him there was a fool who bet a lot and won a lot in the gambling games. To lose against in gambling against someone with Good-Natured Spirit’s caliber, really--Shira sighed--he couldn’t wait for his coming-of-age ceremony next year so he too could farm on these gullible people in some friendly matches--just like what he did with Good-Natured Spirit for this past one year.</p>\n<p>“You know,” munching on some satays he bought from the market, Shira muttered when he headed home along with Good-Natured Spirit, “just then I drank this elixir that really could boost my EXP a little. I don’t know how the guy concocts it, but I have the feeling that I just drink some very expensive elixir for free.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, yeah?”</p>\n<p>On the way back to Yashura Family Shira told the Nalaq spirit about the Alchemist and his elixirs. He also told him that his status that usually wouldn’t react to normal elixirs this time moved a bit after he drank a strange low-quality elixir.</p>\n<p>“That Alchemist must be a nerd to be that sharp,” Good-Natured Spirit said as he floated lazily beside the boy.</p>\n<p>“He looks like that too. The peddler he partnered with also has some good sense in him. So I thought it’s not a loss for me to use all those foreign coins I got from you to invest on them for the next year.”</p>\n<p>“Hmm,” Good-Natured Spirit crossed his arms. “I think you should be worried.”</p>\n<p>“Worried? Why?”</p>\n<p>“You said that nerd Alchemist was the one who pushed that low-quality elixir to you, right?”</p>\n<p>“I got to drink that for free,” Shira emphasized.</p>\n<p>“He realized one little secret about you then,” Good-Natured Spirit said.</p>\n<p>Shira stopped walking. He looked at him with his head tilted.</p>\n<p>“What secret?”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit who floated before, spoke again.</p>\n<p>“You shouldn’t worry about it too much for now, brat. But, I advise you, if you are still holding dear for your lazy, peaceful village life, you should turn back and kill him right now.”</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-1/chapter-3-5":"<p>What the Nalaq told Shira lingered in his mind. Good-Natured Spirit blurted something about killing someone as if it was something trivial that could popped out easily in normal conversation. To kill someone after finding out his secret--what kind of secret he needed to protect anyway? A secret he never wanted people to know the fact he was drawing semi-porns for money. But he wasn’t that insecure to kill someone over a petty secret like that? That would be him being not right in the head. The more he thought about Good-Natured Spirit’s remark, the more it disturbed him. Especially right now, when his hands painted in red, bathed in blood. When he just did an act of actual killing.</p>\n<p>“Something on your mind, Young Master Shira?” a rough voice disturbed his train of thought.</p>\n<p>“Ah,” Shira looked at a burly man, an experienced hunter, who called him.</p>\n<p>The man’s body even drenched in thicker blood than him. One would get easily nauseated by the sight of it. Yet it didn’t make the boy flinched, as he was expecting the experience for a few months already.</p>\n<p>“Here. Look at his gut. Spilling out his innards with your own hands might be a good experience for you, young master.”</p>\n<p>The hunter spun a sharp dagger, holding it by the tip of its blade, having a gesture of offering it to his young master.</p>\n<p>“Is that okay? I even had trouble when skinning the hide,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>He’d rather not, to be honest, since splitting a goat’s gut could be messy if he did it crudely. Even if he was the young master of the family, when messing with the raw meat, not even his uncle could save him from the aunties’ nagging. Shira Yashura was nearly sixteen, almost reaching adulthood, so he had to participate in butchering goats; it was a quite tasking task, but was easy enough compared to butchering cows he had to do in a few years. But for the fifteen years old young master, getting the hang of the butchering knife’s handle was plenty of experience already for him.</p>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>As the custom dictates, every month in ngajen ceremony preparation, the boys will have to deal with cows and goats while the girls help aunties plucking chickens’ and ducks’ feathers. Whether the gatekeepers' children or the family’s next heirs, all of them are required to do it every time a major ceremony approaches.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>After doing his part in butchering a goat Shira immediately took a bath to remove the bloody pungent. On a whim he then strolled to the kitchen to grab some snacks. There he witnessed how all the coconuts he and his uncle shred already transformed into delicious foods; rendang, Bulayak satay, coconut satay, spicy curry, many other mouth drolling coconut cuisines. The coconut loving uncle was all smiles and gave him a big portion of the famous beef cuisine the locals called rendang--which, normally, even for a young master like Shira would get to eat rendang once every few months. But with enough wit and experience in currying favor with his uncle, he got to taste those delicious food handed down by his uncle, the Chief Chef, personally.</p>\n<p>“Shira my boy,” Patriarch Shuro said to his nephew who was squatting below the shadow of a thick pillar, happily munching on his rendang, “you’re going to visit Malikh Family tonight. Keep a good check on your cousin. Don’t embarrass Yashura Family and present our rendang_ _for their main family.”</p>\n<p>“Sure.”</p>\n<hr>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>Domesticated cows were less in numbers than goats in Badril Village, so meals from cows, not including the innards which could be made into popular but cheap cuisines, like only served for village big shots or important visitors during the ngajen ceremony.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>Laughters and chatters made the night more merry than any other thay of the month. It was brighter than usual, as villagers came out of their house to set up big braziers to light the road between the families that were holding festives. From one hundred meters away, through the thick wall of the big families, the mouth-watering aroma of prepared food wafted through the air as if they informally invited people to come and to taste the delicacy these big families had. The change in scenery upon the arrival of the night signaled the nigh of Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>Yashura Family, the oldest family around, was known to have the best food amongst all families in Badril Village, while Elzhier Family known as the family that always threw the biggest party post-ceremony--Elzhier Family’s maidservants were beautiful and they’d show off their voluptuous bodies every single ngajen ceremony. Particularly this month however, everyone was anticipating the ceremony thrown by Malikh Family; for two years since the young lady’s absence they threw nothing more than mediocre festivities, her return was to be seen as their revival on the village’s political stage. And from how big their arrangement looked like, it seemed Malikh Family didn’t plan to fail everyone’s expectations.</p>\n<p>Shira Yashura wore the same suit he got from his uncle on his fifteenth birthday. It was the usual suit he’d wear whenever a ceremony was held. His uncle bought it from a merchant who had connections outside the kingdom, which was pretty good since the fabric wasn’t stiff, but could get unbearably itchy in places he didn’t want to scratch whenever there were people around. The obvious part missing from the wears his peers were wearing was beast pelts.</p>\n<p>Pelts from ferocious beasts were known for irrefutable proof for boys’ courage and manliness. As many young gentlemen of Badril Village wore on their necks, always looking for the opportunity to show off the trophy of their preys to girls--which translated as fashionable fads for boys who wanted to get laids.</p>\n<p>Of course, Shira, as part of the dull and no-nonsense camp of the boys in Badril Village, never had participated in that kind of indecent business. He was so dull that the only girl who would accompany him to attend ceremonies was his cousin Mila--who, even though her face was quite pretty, also happened to be in terrible luck for romance.</p>\n<p>“No matter how many times I see it, it’s always impressive to see how fast you wrap all these banana leaves,” Shira commented as he watched how Mila wrapped rendang with banana leaves. She was very good at it, comparable to the aunties’ skills that had been forged day and night in the family’s kitchen.</p>\n<p>“You talking? You’ve done your training with the family's sword technique, I assume?” Mila said with her lips pouted. Shira thought it was unusual for Mila didn’t nag her mouth off immediately when she saw him. He saw a sword wrapped in cloth near Mila. His face immediately twisted in a troubled look.</p>\n<p>“I won’t bring that thing,” he protested.</p>\n<p>“You--” Mila hissed.</p>\n<p>“What should I do with a sword inside another family’s ceremony?” Shira said. The sword was his father’s, and that was his reason he didn’t want to use it. “Look, I can only draw the blade from the sheath at most. Without a proper amount of Strength attribute I can’t swing this properly. It rejects my mana. I’d make a fool out of myself if that happened.”</p>\n<p>“That’s because you were stupidly increasing your Wisdom instead of, that’s why you--arghh! Just forget about it! I know you’re trying to make excuses! Since you’re so weak all we can do is flaunting around your father’s reputation. We’ve got to remind people that our Yashura Family’s not to mess with. Here, just slip this fucking sword in your belt.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, this is embarrassing. Those rumors are about to get worse tonight,” Shira said with a sigh. His reputation as a trash talent was annoying enough, added this shameless act of throwing his weight around, he’d become more reluctant to show his face in the public later on. But still he unwillingly slipped the sword in his belt.</p>\n<p>Mila snorted. She ignored the complaint. Right now she could care less about the rumors about her cousin. What she had to prioritize tonight was the bad premonition she had about Bhela Malikh’s short hair--nobody believed her when she said that Bhela was being a slut for cutting her hair short in spite of her being in an engagement. While her hands craftly knotted the rendang wrapped in banana leaves with a rope made with dried coconut leaves, she suddenly had a cold smile; the image of those impudent Malikhs shuddering under the famous sword of Yashura Family’s Unique Class, Jhuro Yashura the Blackfang Swordsman, entertained her she began to chuckle coldly.</p>\n<p>“Huhuhu… just you wait you bitch…”</p>\n<p>Shira stepped back. He had the hunch he should keep a distance away from his current cousin right now.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Every month, for every family in Badril Village, cooking during the Ngajen Ceremony was always a time rushing hectic. Even more in Malikh Family this time. Since the amount of food they had to deliver before the ceremony started more than twice the amount they made last month, most of the aunties in duty were cooking outdoors. The smoke from the half-dried firewood would be too unbearable for the eyes if all of them cooked in one cramped place. Fortunately, most of the dishes were already cooked and sent to the courtyard, so the only people who were still on duty preparing food were a small number of aunties and maidservants.</p>\n<p>The young maidservants were pale from tiredness but they couldn’t afford to slack in this one Ngajen Ceremony. The usual noisy aunties, they didn’t even show a sign of wanting to rest. Nobody could beat the resilience of the kitchen-duty armies when it came to preparing for a loadful of party’s foods.</p>\n<p>Usually, the one who would supervise these spartan cooking aunties would be the patriarch’s wife, Bhela’s mother. It was already a long-held tradition in the village for the patriarch to cook for the family’s important guests as the Chief Chef, while the wife supported him by supervising the aunties and maidservants. In Ngajen Ceremony this month, however, Bhela’s mother holed herself to accompany the husband on his ill-bed.</p>\n<p>She was not in the mood to meet with people. So Bhela stepped in to fill her position.</p>\n<p>Back when she was little Bhela often followed her mother working during the ngajen ceremony, she knew what she had to do by the back of her hand. In usage of salt, for example, she knew down to the tiniest detail of how much salt should be applied to different kinds of cuisines. She also instructed the inexperienced maidservants who were in charge of cooking side dishes so the overall quality of the feast would be balanced. Bhela Malikh didn’t betray everyone’s expectations about her. She did her work splendidly.</p>\n<p>However, there was a matter she saw that didn’t make her happy. The largest furnace that was usually reserved for the Chief Chef, today was used by an old man from the outer family. A great cook, the old man was. Known for his vast experience in handling the family’s food stalls for years. The problem was his common status. Without at least an elder status made it awkward for him to cook as the Chief Chef in this kitchen, even if he was a mere proxy. Bhela wondered whether the one who took the charge when her parents were unavailable knew the risk of being laughed at and criticized by the other two big families--especially now that the relationship between Yashura and Malikh wasn’t that good like before.</p>\n<p>“Young lady, the day’s getting dark, you should take a bath now and prepare yourself for the ceremony,” an aunty said to Bhela.</p>\n<p>“Yes, young lady is no longer a little girl, so making you pretty will take a while,” an early twenty maidservant added from the side. She continued, “The new girls should be able to complete the foods since you directed them a lot. Please don’t worry about us.”</p>\n<p>“I’m relieved to hear that,” Bhela said. Not yet three seconds later her eyes wandered to the old cook again. She couldn’t hide her frown.</p>\n<p>“Something the matter, Young Lady Bhela?”</p>\n<p>“Yes. Maybe it’s a misunderstanding on my part but… I can’t see the elder who would substitute my father as the Chief Chef.”</p>\n<p>Hearing Bhela said her concern, the aunties and the maidservants averted eyes with their young lady with troubled faces. Bhela then understood there was something shady going on.</p>\n<p>Her suspicion turned worse when she saw a young man in his twenties leading four manservants with him. When the aunties were working in the kitchen, it was an unspoken rule for unrelated adult men not to approach, but the battle-hardened aunties that normally were ferocious in defending their territories were all silent in welcoming the cocky visitors. It wasn’t surprising to Bhela that all of them came from Elder Jhamil’s faction.</p>\n<p>“Why aren’t you ready yet, old worm?!”</p>\n<p>“I am sorry, young elder… some dish cannot be rushed so I prepared some to--”</p>\n<p><em>Slap!!</em></p>\n<p>The slapping sound echoed in the kitchen. The room descended into a dead silent. The old cook was trembling; he lowered his head and covered the cheek that just got slapped but everyone could see the blood on the corner of his mouth. Bhela recollected her memory, and finally remembered the arrogant young man was actually Elder Jhamil’s own son.</p>\n<p>“Shit!” Elder Jhamil’s son swore, “those councils from Village Hall came. We must complete the set before too long! Those people are the ones who usually have the heaviest voice when valuing Ngajen Ceremony dishes!”</p>\n<p>One follower quipped, “Young elder is right. This old worm can’t cook shit! If this goes on, the only things the Village Hall council will remember about Elder Jhamil’s cooking is that we Malikhs cook as slow as snail!”</p>\n<p>The frown on Bhela’s face became deeper. Young elder? Before she went out for the seminars that lasted two years, this man, son of Elder Jhamil, merely a family member with a post within the family’s business. And something else that disturbed her was how she couldn’t see how the blurted about Elder Jhamil’s cooking, the one who worked in the kitchen all day, didn’t see the said elder even once today.</p>\n<p>Bhela still held her silent. But her eyes were cold and sharp judging people and the situation. The aunties and the maidservants, though they looked sympathetic with the old man, were afraid to go against Elder Jhamil’s son. Maybe because the lack of resistance Elder Jhamil’s son dared to do a taboo known in the kitchen--swapping food that wrapped in banana leaves with ceramic plates, garnished a bit, and called it the Chief Chef’s cuisine.</p>\n<p>“No, young elder!” a brave middle-aged aunty stepped forward, “you can’t do that!”</p>\n<p>“Why not?” one follower sneered in Elder Jhamil’s son’s place. “This one also got beef, isn’t it? We need to quickly serve the Chief Chef cuisine to the people from Village Hall councils.”</p>\n<p>“Exactly because they are from the Village Hall council--just from inferior cuts of the beef they’d know the dishes have been swapped! You’ll tarnish Malikh Family’s honor if people knew you were fooling--”</p>\n<p>“Fooling?!” Elder Jhamil roared.</p>\n<p>The young elder raised his hand, though the aunty who complained quickly hid back behind the maidservants. Elder Jhamil’s son then rampaged into a series of barking, yelling and threatening the aunties to cut their salary just because his mood was spoiled.</p>\n<p>His words scared all the girls and the women inside the kitchen. All except Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>After they were done swapping the foods, the young elder led his men out of the kitchen with great swagger. The young elder stopped at the door, turned around, and gave the old cook one last ultimatum: “There’ll be a noble in the ceremony so we need rendang for the main course. So go make it, old worm. You know what’s gonna happen if you couldn’t deliver, don’t you?”</p>\n<p>The old man trembled. Even the eyes on the aunties couldn’t help but shake at the threat. There was now way they could prepare rendang with only two hours remaining until the Ngajen Ceremony started.</p>\n<p>After that situation calmed down. The aunties and the maidservants went back to work. Some of them still exchanged whispered and gossiped amongst themselves. But when Bhela approached, immediately they stopped and pretended nothing happened.</p>\n<p>“Young lady…” a pudgy aunty came to her, the one who stood up against the young elder from before.</p>\n<p>“Aunty?”</p>\n<p>“We are sorry… we’ve had no meaning to show you that embarrassing scene.”</p>\n<p>Bhela shook her head. “No, I’m one from the main family bloodline; I should've been the one who stood up to him instead of hiding behind everyone.”</p>\n<p>The aunty knew the young lady didn’t say a word before because the girl wanted to know the situation. Some other middle-aged aunties who were close with Madam Malikh also knew more or less Bhela’s detached wait-and-see attitude, so no one really would blame her even if she didn’t say a word before--especially since she had just returned from overseas. The pudgy aunty tugged on Bhela’s sleeve, whispered to her ear, “Young Lady Bhela, we know you’re concerned. But we’ve already gotten used to it. You’re still young. Your future is brighter than everyone else in the family, Young Lady Bhela. It’s better to endure than pointlessly making enemies.”</p>\n<p>“This isn’t pointless,” Bhela said. She then grabbed the nearest apron and wore it. Her father was the patriarch. And she wasn’t a poster girl to draw everyone’s attention to the family.</p>\n<p>The pudgy aunty wanted to say something again. But words stuck on her throat, she closed her mouth as soon as she opened it.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the old man began to pick some mature coconut and shredded it listlessly. He got more than four decades of handling food stalls for Malikh Family, he wasn’t a stranger at cooking rendang. But he already gave up on finishing one for tonight’s Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>“Uncle, I’ll take it from here,” Bhela said as she approached the weary old man.</p>\n<p>“Ahh, yes?” the old man was started. The girl came with an apron and common garment, had fair and beautiful skin, as well clear and articulate voice; a maidservant from the inner family was the first one that came to his mind. But only when he noticed even the aunties were respectful to her and her striking bob-cut short hair that the old man began drenched in cold sweat.</p>\n<p>“I said, uncle,” Bhela repeated, “I’ll take it from here. You can rest now.”</p>\n<p>The old man vigorously shook his head.</p>\n<p>“Please Young Lady Bhela… please spare this old bone….”</p>\n<p>“This is originally my father’s post, uncle. You’ll have to be at least an elder and write your name in council’s ledger to be a substitute for my father.”</p>\n<p>The old man wanted to break into a tearless cry. This is worse than when he faced Elder Jhamil’s son's harassment before. The most thing he was afraid of was the news of Elder Jhamil using him as Chief Chef behind the scene to reach the ears of the main family. And now that Bhela Malikh was here, there was nothing he could do but to resign his life to fate.</p>\n<p>“Y-young lady!” a maidservant yelled, “you can’t!”</p>\n<p>“Who says I can’t?” Bhela asked sharply.</p>\n<p>An aunty, who had a stern-looking face, said, “You can’t cook for the main course, young lady. In case of a patriarch's absence, usually one of the elders who’s going to take his place. There’s no rule saying it’s okay for women to do it.”</p>\n<p>“Then, I’m going to ask,” from the aunty, Bhela threw her glance toward the old man, “are you an elder cooking here to substitute my father as a cook, uncle?”</p>\n<p>The old man’s face turned pale. Whichever the answer of that question would lead him to the road of punishment. All of the sudden, he became a mute.</p>\n<p>Because she had the most standing, nobody made a sound when Young Lady Bhela Malikh asked them to fetch chickens and spices for her.</p>\n<p>Not long after, the story about how the Young Lady of Malikh Family wanted to substitute her father spread like a wildfire. Never in Badril Village’s history would a young lady do that. A crowd of curious males, mostly the youngsters from main and outer of Malikh Family, surrounded the kitchen as they wanted to catch a glimpse of how their beautiful young lady recklessly challenged the custom by her own. The boys sighed in admiration. Bhela Malikh was essentially an Archer at heart. But the way she handled a blade, even if it was a kitchen knife, was skillful and graceful, as every time her slim wrist stopped moving from cutting down a vegetable, a wave of gulping could be heard. The boys couldn’t take their eyes from her. The reckless and brave young lady was simply too charming.</p>\n<p>“Did you know that foreigners often confuse rendang as dried curry?” Bhela said to one maidservant who stared at the way she cooked. “Curry leaves originated from an area close to western Haldeen lands, so many local Mossacks sailed the sea to try their luck making it big working for western empires.”</p>\n<p>The usual aloof Bhela unusually was talkative when she was cooking, which was quite a big surprise for people who were watching. She explained to the clueless maidservants how, during her two years travelling in seminars from countries to countries, found many noble owned restaurants claimed to serve rendang but turned out to be dried curry. All the while sharply focused on doing her cooking duty.</p>\n<p>“Young lady!” from the crowd came out an angry bald man. He was Elder Jhamil. “W-what are you doing there?”</p>\n<p>“I’m cooking,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“But you can’t work there!” Elder Jhamil yelled. “No woman can substitute for patriarch! That’s against the rule!”</p>\n<p>“I don’t recall we have a rule like that.”</p>\n<p>“If you know why you still stand there?”</p>\n<p>“Neither do I recall a rule for an elder to use a stand-in for the Chief Chef position.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s face turned weird as if he suddenly got constipated. Many of the youngsters didn’t catch Bhela’s remarks nor they cared too much about it, but some in the crowd were nodding knowingly, as many of them were familiar with how shady Elder Jhamil was doing things.</p>\n<p>As the bald elder’s head was racing fast looking for an answer to defuse the young lady’s claim, suddenly, a loud roar exploded behind him.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela, who do you think you are? Just because your father is the family’s patriarch you think you can do whatever you want?!”</p>\n<p>The faces of aunties and the maidservants twitched. They witnessed how the young elder harassed the old man before, so they were itching to throw back the same question at him instead, though no more brave aunties dared to cause more troubles.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s son continued, “The ingredient for making Chief dishes takes money, young lady. Not even the patriarch himself has the daring to use coins from the treasury for himself. Do you want to embarrass your parents that much?”</p>\n<p>“I’m not making this food for myself nor I cook for my father. It’s for the guests. And I provided the spices and the foreign curry leaves by myself,” Bhela said. Some maidservants behind her nodded nervously as Bhela indeed ordered them to fetch spices from the personal kitchen in the main family’s residential area.</p>\n<p>In spite of that, the young elder kept pushing on with nasty smile on his face.</p>\n<p>“What about the chicken, young lady? They cost money! What do you say about that, huh?”</p>\n<p>Behind Bhela, the aunties, even the maidservants, were whispering at each other on how ridiculous it was to question the sole young generation of Malikh Family main bloodline over some chickens. Even Bhela, the young lady in question, would only glanced at the troubled expression of Elder Jhamil.</p>\n<p>“I will pay for the chicken,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Ha? Pay? With what? Your father’s money? Can’t a sick person even pay the cost of the foods for ngajen ceremony all by himself?”</p>\n<p>“No need to bring my father’s name here.” Bhela said with a dangerously cold tone.</p>\n<p>The chillness in her eyes was telling that she really did hate people bringing her parents’ name in bad faith. After hearing gasps of surprise from people that didn’t expect the usually silent young lady could utter something with such a biting tone, she sighed, said with an explanation, “I got a dress as a gift from a certain person who has too much money in his pocket. He said the dress is so valuable even the princesses wear them in parties. It should cover the cost of these chickens I’m going to cook if I sell the dress right here right now.”</p>\n<p>Bhela then tilted her head and glanced at the bald elder.</p>\n<p>“Am I right, Elder Jhamil?”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil wanted to maintain his smile, but his face went stiff as stone. He was trembling inside for knowing that the dress he acquired with a large sum of money and with his best connection, valued the same as some mere village chickens in Bhela’s eyes.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, his son, who was taken aback for a bit from the cold remark Bhela had said earlier, recovered, began to yell again, “Ha! Did you not train your brain when you were overseas, my young lady? The same dress princesses wear in parties? Only someone dumb believe that! Hah! Obviously you’ve been lied to! You’ve been crooked, young lady, crooked--”</p>\n<p><em>Paak!</em></p>\n<p>From behind, the already red-faced Elder Jhamil smacked his son’s head. “You’ve been rude to Young Lady Bhela, you dumbskull! You have to apologize! Young lady can’t bear to hear it anymore!”</p>\n<p>While in fact it was him who couldn’t bear to hear being called a crook.</p>\n<p>“Apologize!” Elder Jhamil roared.</p>\n<p><em>Splash!</em></p>\n<p>The pair father and son’s performance didn’t amuse Bhela, however. With the lid in her hand, Bhela scooped boiling curry broth and splashed it to their direction. Surprised, the stupid young elder swore with nasty words while his father cried in high-pitched voice.</p>\n<p>“Please get out,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil laughed wryly.</p>\n<p>“Please don’t be like that, young lady. I know my son doesn't have the best education but--”</p>\n<p><em>Splash!!</em></p>\n<p>Bhela waved the cooking lid once again as soon as Elder Jhamil stepped forward. The hot water splashed on his expensive boots. This time, while he didn’t expect for Bhela splashing hot water at him again, he wasn’t freaking out. It seemed his plan to make the young lady behave a little backfiring instead. His face turned solemn.</p>\n<p>“Young lady…”</p>\n<p>“I’m not going to say it thrice--everyone who has nothing to do in the kitchen, please get out,” Bhela said. “Or else--”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The major families’ lands were astonishingly spacious and complex, their walls were thick and tall, therefore each of them employed a few stationary guards for the main gate as gatekeepers. These gatekeepers, though usually filled by members of the outer part of the families, their duty were significantly more important than others since they represented the face of the family they served. So they always maintain polite gestures to everyone who came through their gate, either commoners or rich people from big families. Yet when Shira and Mila arrived the Malikh Family’s gatekeepers didn’t even hide their scoffs.</p>\n<p>“Ridiculous!” she hissed with a face boiled in anger, “even lowly gatekeepers are looking down on us!”</p>\n<p>“Don’t bother with them,” Shira said. Unlike his cousin’s furious temper, his flair seemed like he shrugged the blatant disrespect, as the holder of “Eternal Novice” title he was already numb by how people were talking behind his back.</p>\n<p>“If your father was here they’d bow their asses as soon as they saw us Yashura coming.”</p>\n<p>Shira shrugged his shoulders again.</p>\n<p>Still seething in anger, Mila cast her eyes on the banana leaves wrapped food in Shira’s hands. “Who should we give the rendang to?” she asked.</p>\n<p>“Let’s just give it to a random servant.” Then Shira called a maidservant who was carrying a tray full of food. “Excuse me!”</p>\n<p>“Yes? What can I help y--” The moment this maidservant turned her head and saw Shira’s face, she immediately threw back her eyes and escaped with hurried trot, pretending she saw nothing.</p>\n<p>“The fuck?!” Mila was flastergabbed, didn’t know what to say.</p>\n<p>Later on Shira and Mila realized how unpopular Yashura Family was to the current Malikhs, even the servants who usually held no voice in the family were avoiding the pair of cousins like plague. Their attitude especially worsened when it came to Shira Yashura.</p>\n<p>“Look there,” someone whispered amongst the guests, “Yashura Family send their eldest young miss and the young master! Out of all the Ngajen Ceremony, they choose tonight to show their faces--pretty obvious, eh? Bet they’re drooling to get another Unique Class after knowing our Young Lady Bhela’s real talent tonight!”</p>\n<p>Someone else agreed and replied, “With that kind of trash as their young master, they’d be dreamin’ to get even a touch of our Young Lady Bhela. Pueh!”</p>\n<p>Hearing the muffled disdain, Mila Yashura whirled her body, glaring people with eagle eyes. “Who said that?!” she growled.</p>\n<p>“Mila…” Shira held her shoulder.</p>\n<p>“The fuckers don’t even put our Yashura Family in their eyes. Just because shitty rumors about Unique Class they started to feel high and mighty, eh?”</p>\n<p>“Just let go, Uncle Shuro didn’t send us here to start troubles,” Shira said. “All we need to do is to show our faces here and give them our rendang. It’s not our problem whether they welcome our good intention with grace or not.”</p>\n<p>Though Shira said that, he secretly hoped Malikh Family would grow too proud to receive it--all so he had an excuse to keep his uncle’s rendang for himself.</p>\n<p>A commotion arose. People hussing here and there with excitement. When Shira and Mila wanted to know what was going on, a parade of beautiful young women glittering and stealing the whole show came from inside of Malikh Family’s hall. Leading them was a short-haired young beauty, face as icy as an ice sculpture, the recent name that everyone had been talking about these days, Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>It was clear from the way Bhela positioned herself she represented the family as the ceremony’s Chief Chef.</p>\n<p>“Whoa, so Malikh Family let her do that,” Shira murmured.</p>\n<p>Not to mention being the Chief Chef--the most Shira did in his family’s kitchen was helping his uncle, helping him shred coconuts. They were at the same age, but the same old Shira still practiced butchering goats while the supposed fiancée of his was climbing the social ladder. Even Mila was angry by the special treatment Malikh Family gave to their young lady.</p>\n<p>“Sup, young master!” from behind a voice called him.</p>\n<p>Shira turned around, found the one who greeted him was Monkey.</p>\n<p>“Who?” Mila asked Shira as the stranger with a monkey-like face approaching.</p>\n<p>“This one is called by the name of Monkey, young lady,” Monkey, with his self-trained Mossack’s style bowing gesture, introduced himself smoothly.</p>\n<p>Mila hummed in ackwnoledgement. It was harder to forget than remembering someone with such combination of face and awkward name.</p>\n<p>“Mister Monkey, I thought you’ll spend the ceremony to show Mister Snake around since he’s an outsider. What are you doing in Malikh Family?” Shira asked.</p>\n<p>“Now, now, please drop the ‘Mister’, young master. I’m not that old yet to be called as such,” Monkey said, then he continued explaining his story this evening. “We were planning to go to your family’s ceremony, young master. But who would have thought Snake to meet with his relatives here? His relatives are actually Malikh Family’s guests for tonight’s Ngajen Ceremony. Bet he got to eat expensive cuisines right now.”</p>\n<p>“Well, it’ll be easier with Mister Snake here. I’ve got some coins I want to show you, I wonder if it works to use them for--” Shira sneakily glanced at his cousin, then turned back to Monkey like it was nothing, “--for the thing we talked about yesterday.”</p>\n<p>Mila sneered, “You have some business to attend, no?”</p>\n<p>“Not really, no,” Shira shrugged off her question.</p>\n<p>“Really, though?” Mila crossed her arms, sneered again. “I think I saw Romana just now. I’mma chat with her a little bit.”</p>\n<p>It seemed to Shira that his cousin meeting with Romana here, in Malikh Family’s Ngajen Ceremony, wasn’t simply to have fun. He didn’t like his cousin would make trouble but he didn’t want to spend the whole night with her either. “Don’t go home without me,” he said eventually.</p>\n<p>“Hmph! You’re not a kid anymore but still need me to accompany you home?”</p>\n<p>No, Shira actually was more worried about her than himself.</p>\n<p>He then glanced beside and said, “Mister Monkey.”</p>\n<p>“Just Monkey,” Monkey corrected.</p>\n<p>“Mister Just Monkey, you said Mister Snake with relative? And his relatives are Malikh Family’s guests?”</p>\n<p>“Not Just Mon--ah, forget about it,” Monkey already gave up guessing whether Young Master Shira Yashura was purposely pulling his leg or not. “They really were Malikh Family’s guests, they even got the front row for the prayer and all.”</p>\n<p>“Is hard for us to be friendly if Mister Snake is involved with Malikh Family.”</p>\n<p>“You mean, that, huh? Well, I’ve been here for a while and they talked about you a lot, so I guess even someone as chill as you can get angry sometimes. But you don’t have to worry about those Malikhs, Young Master Shira. As long as their patriarch is Ghalim Malikh they won’t sever ties with Yashura so easily.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, is this your opinion?”</p>\n<p>“It’s Snake’s. It’s what he said before he met his relatives.”</p>\n<p>Shira thought the Alchemist he met once before was a total stranger of Badril Village, but it appeared he was wrong. “He really does know about Malikh Family that much, doesn’t he?”</p>\n<p>“Well, yeah, but I think he’s more familiar with Yashura than Malikh Family, though,” Monkey said, crossing his arms and nodded to himself as he recalled things that Snake told him to get his wares supported by Yashura Family; for example, obtaining Butler Yulong’s permission the same as Patriarch Shuro Yashura’s, Snake once said.</p>\n<p>“What? Why do you make that kind of face, Young Master Shira?” Monkey was snapped from his train of thought.</p>\n<p>“Ah, no, I just don’t expect you’re going to say some like that.”</p>\n<p>“What are you saying, young master. In the first place, Snake became my crew because he heard I’ve some dealing with Yashura Family.”</p>\n<p>Shira did recall the first time Monkey contacted Yashura Family--through him. To be more exact, the first item Monkey dealt from Malikh Family was Shira’s smuggled erotic painting that Good-Natured Spirit rejected.</p>\n<p>“--Speaking of Snake,” with his thumb Monkey did point in a certain direction. The place was separated from the common guest as they indeed were Malikh Family’s special guests. Shira’s eyes followed and he saw the familiar Alchemist he knew not long ago, Snake, was talking with two men, young and old, most likely brother and his grandfather.</p>\n<p>“Don’t be fooled by their appearances, young master. They’re renowned experts,” Monkey said.</p>\n<p>The pair of brother and grandfather wore worn out pale robes as their clothes, unlike the image of revered experts in Shira’s mind. Monkey told him both likely to travel incognito for various reasons. The old man had an old white hair and long beard, his back crooked and had to bring a walking staff to support himself, and gave people the impression of a sleepy grandpa from the dim light on his eyes. The young one though, had an always angry-looking face with fierce brows, crossing his muscle-thick arms, locked in a debate with Snake. Snake’s face was notably paler than when Shira met him in the market.</p>\n<p>“We can’t greet Mister Snake now, can we?” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think we can,” Monkey said. Even though he long considered Snake as his partner, the two guests appearing incognito were still the main members of the revered Alchemist family. This was no time for commoners like him acting friendly on them all of the sudden.</p>\n<p>The sleepy-looking old man, noticing two pairs of eyes looking at him, he raised his head. He caught the sight of Shira. Their eyes met.</p>\n<p>“Oh ho,” the old man smiled when he found the boy. He dragged his old body to approach the flastergabbed Shira and Monkey.</p>\n<p>Even Monkey who knew more about them wouldn’t expect Snake’s relatives to introduce themselves first.</p>\n<p>“He’s heading this way…”</p>\n<p>“Ah, yes, apparently.”</p>\n<p>Monkey gulped. “It’s different with Snake. Although he looked like that, whatever you do, please, young master, you can’t afford to be rude in front of this elder…”</p>\n<p>From the nervousness in Monkey’s voice Shira found the approaching old man seemed to hail from a more prestigious family than he originally thought.</p>\n<p>“Greeting, elder,” Shira said with his head humbly lowered as soon as he approached.</p>\n<p>The old man chuckled, patted Shira’s head, said, “Ah, Young Master, look how much you’ve grown. It feels like only yesterday how happy you were running around like a little kid you are.”</p>\n<p>Shira nodded hearing that. He glanced beside him, and caught Monkey’s face flabbergasted looking both at the boy and the old man.</p>\n<p>Hiding his embarrassment behind a fake cough, Shira then tried to understand whether the old man mistook him for someone else. “I’m sorry, elder. I don’t know if I’m mistaken, but, have we met before?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, have we met? Of course we’ve--” he stopped. The old man's eyes were covered by a pair of soft hands of a girl.</p>\n<p>“Guess who this is?” the girl who sneakily teased the old man from behind was grinning.</p>\n<p>“Oho! Who is this? Who is this?” the old man smiled delightedly.</p>\n<p>Both Shira and Monkey were tense watching the scene before them. Especially Shira Yashura, who knew that the grin on his cousin’s face always told that the girl enjoyed herself a little bit too much.</p>\n<p>“Isn’t this… Tomboy Princess?” the old man guessed.</p>\n<p>“Tuut! Wrong!”</p>\n<p>Mila released her hands. When the old man turned to see the preparator, he exclaimed with a chuckle.</p>\n<p>“It’s really you, Tomboy Princess.”</p>\n<p>Mila excitedly echoed, “It’s really you, Grandpa Piss!”</p>\n<p>They were so glad they met after a long time that they started to hug each other. Then Mila pull herself from the oldman’s embrace, yelling, “Ugghh…” she pinched her nose, “I smell something pissy around here.”</p>\n<p>Just when Shira and Monkey wondered what Mila meant by that, the girl looked at the old man, saying, “It’s no wonder it smells pissy. Have you taken a bath, Grandpa Piss.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss answered with a laugh. But Shira and Monkey facepalmed.</p>\n<p>So much for being mindful in front of the revered old expert.</p>\n<p>Shira awkwardly smiled to cover his shame. “Mila, you should be mindful in front of elders.”</p>\n<p>“Mindful?” Mila gasped. “In front of Grandpa Piss? Why?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, it’s okay, young master,” the old man said as he waved his hand. “I’m not that old to lose my sense of humor. Yashura Family’s princess sure is as naughty as always.” His wrinkles deepened as he curled his lips into a big smile. He said to Mila, “I reckon Patriarch Shuro’s been well, my princess? I recall he got a lot of migraines back in the day.”</p>\n<p>Haughtily, Mila replied, “Don’t worry about that guy, Grandpa Piss. His brain capacity has been declining these past years so there’s really nothing left inside to give him any headache!”</p>\n<p>“Ehem,” Shira cleared his phlegm. “She meant our patriarch has been well, elder.”</p>\n<p>“That’s what I said,” Mila laughed, and the old man laughed too. After that Mila kissed Grandpa Piss’s right hand as if she was kissing an elder’s hand from her own family, then continued laughing as cheeky as always.</p>\n<p>“My naughty princess,” Grandpa Piss ruffled Mila’s hair, “I planned to visit Yashura Family later. But since we’ve already met, here, please take this.”</p>\n<p>Receiving a pack wrapped in dried leaves, Mila pouted her lips. “You wouldn’t be lying about this being a candy again, would you?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, of course not.”</p>\n<p>As far as her memory served her well, what Grandpa Piss called candy actually a really bitter herb for young children to gain their appetite. Mila sniffed. She opened it and have a little taste. “Uuueeekk!”</p>\n<p>It was sour and even more bitter than she remembered. “What the hell is this?!”</p>\n<p>“That herb’s not for consumption, Young Lady Mila” the big man with muscles, Snake’s big brother, said from behind Grandpa Piss. He was smiling politely despite the other party merely a young lady of a rural village. “It’s a cosmetic for skin care.”</p>\n<p>“Skin care?!”</p>\n<p>Mila’s mouth widened agape. But soon as she glanced at the muscle man who was approaching her, she became wary, leaned to Grandpa Piss and whispered, “Grandpa Piss, who’s that?”</p>\n<p>With a patient smile replied, Grandpa Piss said, “He’s Snotty. Don’t you remember Snotty?”</p>\n<p>Mila was surprised. “Oooohh! Snotty! You’ve turned into a real man now I can’t even recognize you anymore!”</p>\n<p>“Haha… you’re surely jest young lady,” Snotty said.</p>\n<p>“No, really…” with fingers on her chin, eyes on muscles, Mila added, “you really transformed into something new, Snotty. I’m impressed. You were so skinny and really a snotty boy back then.”</p>\n<p>The man continued to laugh. The atmosphere was friendly and harmless. Yet Monkey, who had long heard Snotty’s real identity and preceding reputation from Snake’s mouth, began sweating profusely.</p>\n<p>Mila really loved gifted cosmetics and the like. After knowing how effective it was for her beauty, she shamelessly asked, “Can I ask for more, Grandpa Piss? I have a good friend who needs to be a beauty--as soon as possible!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, of course I have more--here, take this,” Grandpa Piss took out another one.</p>\n<p>“Waow!” Mila’s eyes sparkled in a weird glint. Shira, who saw that, knew his cousin’s greed began to surface; suddenly the unruly young lady acted as if she was a timid maiden. “Grandpa Piss… I think my other friend needs it too…” she asked sweetly.</p>\n<p>“Hohoh!” Grandpa Piss stroked his beard again. “Unfortunately, my princess, I’ve got only three pack and I planned to give the last one for Young Lady Malikh.”</p>\n<p>Hearing a certain short-haired girl being mentioned, the shy maiden’s face twisted in an ugly sour face, returned back to her original color. “Tch.”</p>\n<p>“Hey, don’t click your tongue in front of elders,” Shira warned her.</p>\n<p>“Tch.” Mila crossed her arms and threw away her pouting face.</p>\n<p>Shira was always frustrated whenever a younger one like him would be the one to reprimand ethics into this blockhead of a girl.</p>\n<p>“Now, now, young lady. Please remember Grandpa’s already too old to concoct too many cosmetics--getting two packs already good enough,” Snotty said.</p>\n<p>Snake looked at the leaves wrapped cosmetics in Mila’s hands and exclaimed, “Grandfather concocted them himself?”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss nodded with an amiable smile. “Of course. Been twelve years since the last time I was here. It’d be embarrassing if I came with half-hearted gifts, don’t you think so?”</p>\n<hr>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>The nickname of “Grandpa Piss” stuck on Grandmaster Alchemist’s name for twelve years. When a friend of his asked the origin of this horrible nickname, the Grandmaster laughed it off and said a princess of his old friend’s family started calling him that, because her cousin who was still a three years old brat urinated on him every time the Grandmaster tried to hug him.</p>\n<p>Legend said that the princess was also calling the heir of Grandmaster Alchemist’s family with the nickname of “Snotty”. But even to this day, nobody knows which kingdom this cheeky princess comes from.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n","volume-1/chapter-3":"<p>What the Nalaq told Shira lingered in his mind. Good-Natured Spirit blurted something about killing someone as if it was something trivial that could popped out easily in normal conversation. To kill someone after finding out his secret--what kind of secret he needed to protect anyway? A secret he never wanted people to know the fact he was drawing semi-porns for money. But he wasn’t that insecure to kill someone over a petty secret like that? That would be him being not right in the head. The more he thought about Good-Natured Spirit’s remark, the more it disturbed him. Especially right now, when his hands painted in red, bathed in blood. When he just did an act of actual killing.</p>\n<p>“Something on your mind, Young Master Shira?” a rough voice disturbed his train of thought.</p>\n<p>“Ah,” Shira looked at a burly man, an experienced hunter, who called him.</p>\n<p>The man’s body even drenched in thicker blood than him. One would get easily nauseated by the sight of it. Yet it didn’t make the boy flinched, as he was expecting the experience for a few months already.</p>\n<p>“Here. Look at his gut. Spilling out his innards with your own hands might be a good experience for you, young master.”</p>\n<p>The hunter spun a sharp dagger, holding it by the tip of its blade, having a gesture of offering it to his young master.</p>\n<p>“Is that okay? I even had trouble when skinning the hide,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>He’d rather not, to be honest, since splitting a goat’s gut could be messy if he did it crudely. Even if he was the young master of the family, when messing with the raw meat, not even his uncle could save him from the aunties’ nagging. Shira Yashura was nearly sixteen, almost reaching adulthood, so he had to participate in butchering goats; it was a quite tasking task, but was easy enough compared to butchering cows he had to do in a few years. But for the fifteen years old young master, getting the hang of the butchering knife’s handle was plenty of experience already for him.</p>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>As the custom dictates, every month in ngajen ceremony preparation, the boys will have to deal with cows and goats while the girls help aunties plucking chickens’ and ducks’ feathers. Whether the gatekeepers' children or the family’s next heirs, all of them are required to do it every time a major ceremony approaches.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>After doing his part in butchering a goat Shira immediately took a bath to remove the bloody pungent. On a whim he then strolled to the kitchen to grab some snacks. There he witnessed how all the coconuts he and his uncle shred already transformed into delicious foods; rendang, Bulayak satay, coconut satay, spicy curry, many other mouth drolling coconut cuisines. The coconut loving uncle was all smiles and gave him a big portion of the famous beef cuisine the locals called rendang--which, normally, even for a young master like Shira would get to eat rendang once every few months. But with enough wit and experience in currying favor with his uncle, he got to taste those delicious food handed down by his uncle, the Chief Chef, personally.</p>\n<p>“Shira my boy,” Patriarch Shuro said to his nephew who was squatting below the shadow of a thick pillar, happily munching on his rendang, “you’re going to visit Malikh Family tonight. Keep a good check on your cousin. Don’t embarrass Yashura Family and present our rendang_ _for their main family.”</p>\n<p>“Sure.”</p>\n<hr>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>Domesticated cows were less in numbers than goats in Badril Village, so meals from cows, not including the innards which could be made into popular but cheap cuisines, like only served for village big shots or important visitors during the ngajen ceremony.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>Laughters and chatters made the night more merry than any other thay of the month. It was brighter than usual, as villagers came out of their house to set up big braziers to light the road between the families that were holding festives. From one hundred meters away, through the thick wall of the big families, the mouth-watering aroma of prepared food wafted through the air as if they informally invited people to come and to taste the delicacy these big families had. The change in scenery upon the arrival of the night signaled the nigh of Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>Yashura Family, the oldest family around, was known to have the best food amongst all families in Badril Village, while Elzhier Family known as the family that always threw the biggest party post-ceremony--Elzhier Family’s maidservants were beautiful and they’d show off their voluptuous bodies every single ngajen ceremony. Particularly this month however, everyone was anticipating the ceremony thrown by Malikh Family; for two years since the young lady’s absence they threw nothing more than mediocre festivities, her return was to be seen as their revival on the village’s political stage. And from how big their arrangement looked like, it seemed Malikh Family didn’t plan to fail everyone’s expectations.</p>\n<p>Shira Yashura wore the same suit he got from his uncle on his fifteenth birthday. It was the usual suit he’d wear whenever a ceremony was held. His uncle bought it from a merchant who had connections outside the kingdom, which was pretty good since the fabric wasn’t stiff, but could get unbearably itchy in places he didn’t want to scratch whenever there were people around. The obvious part missing from the wears his peers were wearing was beast pelts.</p>\n<p>Pelts from ferocious beasts were known for irrefutable proof for boys’ courage and manliness. As many young gentlemen of Badril Village wore on their necks, always looking for the opportunity to show off the trophy of their preys to girls--which translated as fashionable fads for boys who wanted to get laids.</p>\n<p>Of course, Shira, as part of the dull and no-nonsense camp of the boys in Badril Village, never had participated in that kind of indecent business. He was so dull that the only girl who would accompany him to attend ceremonies was his cousin Mila--who, even though her face was quite pretty, also happened to be in terrible luck for romance.</p>\n<p>“No matter how many times I see it, it’s always impressive to see how fast you wrap all these banana leaves,” Shira commented as he watched how Mila wrapped rendang with banana leaves. She was very good at it, comparable to the aunties’ skills that had been forged day and night in the family’s kitchen.</p>\n<p>“You talking? You’ve done your training with the family's sword technique, I assume?” Mila said with her lips pouted. Shira thought it was unusual for Mila didn’t nag her mouth off immediately when she saw him. He saw a sword wrapped in cloth near Mila. His face immediately twisted in a troubled look.</p>\n<p>“I won’t bring that thing,” he protested.</p>\n<p>“You--” Mila hissed.</p>\n<p>“What should I do with a sword inside another family’s ceremony?” Shira said. The sword was his father’s, and that was his reason he didn’t want to use it. “Look, I can only draw the blade from the sheath at most. Without a proper amount of Strength attribute I can’t swing this properly. It rejects my mana. I’d make a fool out of myself if that happened.”</p>\n<p>“That’s because you were stupidly increasing your Wisdom instead of, that’s why you--arghh! Just forget about it! I know you’re trying to make excuses! Since you’re so weak all we can do is flaunting around your father’s reputation. We’ve got to remind people that our Yashura Family’s not to mess with. Here, just slip this fucking sword in your belt.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, this is embarrassing. Those rumors are about to get worse tonight,” Shira said with a sigh. His reputation as a trash talent was annoying enough, added this shameless act of throwing his weight around, he’d become more reluctant to show his face in the public later on. But still he unwillingly slipped the sword in his belt.</p>\n<p>Mila snorted. She ignored the complaint. Right now she could care less about the rumors about her cousin. What she had to prioritize tonight was the bad premonition she had about Bhela Malikh’s short hair--nobody believed her when she said that Bhela was being a slut for cutting her hair short in spite of her being in an engagement. While her hands craftly knotted the rendang wrapped in banana leaves with a rope made with dried coconut leaves, she suddenly had a cold smile; the image of those impudent Malikhs shuddering under the famous sword of Yashura Family’s Unique Class, Jhuro Yashura the Blackfang Swordsman, entertained her she began to chuckle coldly.</p>\n<p>“Huhuhu… just you wait you bitch…”</p>\n<p>Shira stepped back. He had the hunch he should keep a distance away from his current cousin right now.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Every month, for every family in Badril Village, cooking during the Ngajen Ceremony was always a time rushing hectic. Even more in Malikh Family this time. Since the amount of food they had to deliver before the ceremony started more than twice the amount they made last month, most of the aunties in duty were cooking outdoors. The smoke from the half-dried firewood would be too unbearable for the eyes if all of them cooked in one cramped place. Fortunately, most of the dishes were already cooked and sent to the courtyard, so the only people who were still on duty preparing food were a small number of aunties and maidservants.</p>\n<p>The young maidservants were pale from tiredness but they couldn’t afford to slack in this one Ngajen Ceremony. The usual noisy aunties, they didn’t even show a sign of wanting to rest. Nobody could beat the resilience of the kitchen-duty armies when it came to preparing for a loadful of party’s foods.</p>\n<p>Usually, the one who would supervise these spartan cooking aunties would be the patriarch’s wife, Bhela’s mother. It was already a long-held tradition in the village for the patriarch to cook for the family’s important guests as the Chief Chef, while the wife supported him by supervising the aunties and maidservants. In Ngajen Ceremony this month, however, Bhela’s mother holed herself to accompany the husband on his ill-bed.</p>\n<p>She was not in the mood to meet with people. So Bhela stepped in to fill her position.</p>\n<p>Back when she was little Bhela often followed her mother working during the ngajen ceremony, she knew what she had to do by the back of her hand. In usage of salt, for example, she knew down to the tiniest detail of how much salt should be applied to different kinds of cuisines. She also instructed the inexperienced maidservants who were in charge of cooking side dishes so the overall quality of the feast would be balanced. Bhela Malikh didn’t betray everyone’s expectations about her. She did her work splendidly.</p>\n<p>However, there was a matter she saw that didn’t make her happy. The largest furnace that was usually reserved for the Chief Chef, today was used by an old man from the outer family. A great cook, the old man was. Known for his vast experience in handling the family’s food stalls for years. The problem was his common status. Without at least an elder status made it awkward for him to cook as the Chief Chef in this kitchen, even if he was a mere proxy. Bhela wondered whether the one who took the charge when her parents were unavailable knew the risk of being laughed at and criticized by the other two big families--especially now that the relationship between Yashura and Malikh wasn’t that good like before.</p>\n<p>“Young lady, the day’s getting dark, you should take a bath now and prepare yourself for the ceremony,” an aunty said to Bhela.</p>\n<p>“Yes, young lady is no longer a little girl, so making you pretty will take a while,” an early twenty maidservant added from the side. She continued, “The new girls should be able to complete the foods since you directed them a lot. Please don’t worry about us.”</p>\n<p>“I’m relieved to hear that,” Bhela said. Not yet three seconds later her eyes wandered to the old cook again. She couldn’t hide her frown.</p>\n<p>“Something the matter, Young Lady Bhela?”</p>\n<p>“Yes. Maybe it’s a misunderstanding on my part but… I can’t see the elder who would substitute my father as the Chief Chef.”</p>\n<p>Hearing Bhela said her concern, the aunties and the maidservants averted eyes with their young lady with troubled faces. Bhela then understood there was something shady going on.</p>\n<p>Her suspicion turned worse when she saw a young man in his twenties leading four manservants with him. When the aunties were working in the kitchen, it was an unspoken rule for unrelated adult men not to approach, but the battle-hardened aunties that normally were ferocious in defending their territories were all silent in welcoming the cocky visitors. It wasn’t surprising to Bhela that all of them came from Elder Jhamil’s faction.</p>\n<p>“Why aren’t you ready yet, old worm?!”</p>\n<p>“I am sorry, young elder… some dish cannot be rushed so I prepared some to--”</p>\n<p><em>Slap!!</em></p>\n<p>The slapping sound echoed in the kitchen. The room descended into a dead silent. The old cook was trembling; he lowered his head and covered the cheek that just got slapped but everyone could see the blood on the corner of his mouth. Bhela recollected her memory, and finally remembered the arrogant young man was actually Elder Jhamil’s own son.</p>\n<p>“Shit!” Elder Jhamil’s son swore, “those councils from Village Hall came. We must complete the set before too long! Those people are the ones who usually have the heaviest voice when valuing Ngajen Ceremony dishes!”</p>\n<p>One follower quipped, “Young elder is right. This old worm can’t cook shit! If this goes on, the only things the Village Hall council will remember about Elder Jhamil’s cooking is that we Malikhs cook as slow as snail!”</p>\n<p>The frown on Bhela’s face became deeper. Young elder? Before she went out for the seminars that lasted two years, this man, son of Elder Jhamil, merely a family member with a post within the family’s business. And something else that disturbed her was how she couldn’t see how the blurted about Elder Jhamil’s cooking, the one who worked in the kitchen all day, didn’t see the said elder even once today.</p>\n<p>Bhela still held her silent. But her eyes were cold and sharp judging people and the situation. The aunties and the maidservants, though they looked sympathetic with the old man, were afraid to go against Elder Jhamil’s son. Maybe because the lack of resistance Elder Jhamil’s son dared to do a taboo known in the kitchen--swapping food that wrapped in banana leaves with ceramic plates, garnished a bit, and called it the Chief Chef’s cuisine.</p>\n<p>“No, young elder!” a brave middle-aged aunty stepped forward, “you can’t do that!”</p>\n<p>“Why not?” one follower sneered in Elder Jhamil’s son’s place. “This one also got beef, isn’t it? We need to quickly serve the Chief Chef cuisine to the people from Village Hall councils.”</p>\n<p>“Exactly because they are from the Village Hall council--just from inferior cuts of the beef they’d know the dishes have been swapped! You’ll tarnish Malikh Family’s honor if people knew you were fooling--”</p>\n<p>“Fooling?!” Elder Jhamil roared.</p>\n<p>The young elder raised his hand, though the aunty who complained quickly hid back behind the maidservants. Elder Jhamil’s son then rampaged into a series of barking, yelling and threatening the aunties to cut their salary just because his mood was spoiled.</p>\n<p>His words scared all the girls and the women inside the kitchen. All except Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>After they were done swapping the foods, the young elder led his men out of the kitchen with great swagger. The young elder stopped at the door, turned around, and gave the old cook one last ultimatum: “There’ll be a noble in the ceremony so we need rendang for the main course. So go make it, old worm. You know what’s gonna happen if you couldn’t deliver, don’t you?”</p>\n<p>The old man trembled. Even the eyes on the aunties couldn’t help but shake at the threat. There was now way they could prepare rendang with only two hours remaining until the Ngajen Ceremony started.</p>\n<p>After that situation calmed down. The aunties and the maidservants went back to work. Some of them still exchanged whispered and gossiped amongst themselves. But when Bhela approached, immediately they stopped and pretended nothing happened.</p>\n<p>“Young lady…” a pudgy aunty came to her, the one who stood up against the young elder from before.</p>\n<p>“Aunty?”</p>\n<p>“We are sorry… we’ve had no meaning to show you that embarrassing scene.”</p>\n<p>Bhela shook her head. “No, I’m one from the main family bloodline; I should've been the one who stood up to him instead of hiding behind everyone.”</p>\n<p>The aunty knew the young lady didn’t say a word before because the girl wanted to know the situation. Some other middle-aged aunties who were close with Madam Malikh also knew more or less Bhela’s detached wait-and-see attitude, so no one really would blame her even if she didn’t say a word before--especially since she had just returned from overseas. The pudgy aunty tugged on Bhela’s sleeve, whispered to her ear, “Young Lady Bhela, we know you’re concerned. But we’ve already gotten used to it. You’re still young. Your future is brighter than everyone else in the family, Young Lady Bhela. It’s better to endure than pointlessly making enemies.”</p>\n<p>“This isn’t pointless,” Bhela said. She then grabbed the nearest apron and wore it. Her father was the patriarch. And she wasn’t a poster girl to draw everyone’s attention to the family.</p>\n<p>The pudgy aunty wanted to say something again. But words stuck on her throat, she closed her mouth as soon as she opened it.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the old man began to pick some mature coconut and shredded it listlessly. He got more than four decades of handling food stalls for Malikh Family, he wasn’t a stranger at cooking rendang. But he already gave up on finishing one for tonight’s Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>“Uncle, I’ll take it from here,” Bhela said as she approached the weary old man.</p>\n<p>“Ahh, yes?” the old man was started. The girl came with an apron and common garment, had fair and beautiful skin, as well clear and articulate voice; a maidservant from the inner family was the first one that came to his mind. But only when he noticed even the aunties were respectful to her and her striking bob-cut short hair that the old man began drenched in cold sweat.</p>\n<p>“I said, uncle,” Bhela repeated, “I’ll take it from here. You can rest now.”</p>\n<p>The old man vigorously shook his head.</p>\n<p>“Please Young Lady Bhela… please spare this old bone….”</p>\n<p>“This is originally my father’s post, uncle. You’ll have to be at least an elder and write your name in council’s ledger to be a substitute for my father.”</p>\n<p>The old man wanted to break into a tearless cry. This is worse than when he faced Elder Jhamil’s son's harassment before. The most thing he was afraid of was the news of Elder Jhamil using him as Chief Chef behind the scene to reach the ears of the main family. And now that Bhela Malikh was here, there was nothing he could do but to resign his life to fate.</p>\n<p>“Y-young lady!” a maidservant yelled, “you can’t!”</p>\n<p>“Who says I can’t?” Bhela asked sharply.</p>\n<p>An aunty, who had a stern-looking face, said, “You can’t cook for the main course, young lady. In case of a patriarch's absence, usually one of the elders who’s going to take his place. There’s no rule saying it’s okay for women to do it.”</p>\n<p>“Then, I’m going to ask,” from the aunty, Bhela threw her glance toward the old man, “are you an elder cooking here to substitute my father as a cook, uncle?”</p>\n<p>The old man’s face turned pale. Whichever the answer of that question would lead him to the road of punishment. All of the sudden, he became a mute.</p>\n<p>Because she had the most standing, nobody made a sound when Young Lady Bhela Malikh asked them to fetch chickens and spices for her.</p>\n<p>Not long after, the story about how the Young Lady of Malikh Family wanted to substitute her father spread like a wildfire. Never in Badril Village’s history would a young lady do that. A crowd of curious males, mostly the youngsters from main and outer of Malikh Family, surrounded the kitchen as they wanted to catch a glimpse of how their beautiful young lady recklessly challenged the custom by her own. The boys sighed in admiration. Bhela Malikh was essentially an Archer at heart. But the way she handled a blade, even if it was a kitchen knife, was skillful and graceful, as every time her slim wrist stopped moving from cutting down a vegetable, a wave of gulping could be heard. The boys couldn’t take their eyes from her. The reckless and brave young lady was simply too charming.</p>\n<p>“Did you know that foreigners often confuse rendang as dried curry?” Bhela said to one maidservant who stared at the way she cooked. “Curry leaves originated from an area close to western Haldeen lands, so many local Mossacks sailed the sea to try their luck making it big working for western empires.”</p>\n<p>The usual aloof Bhela unusually was talkative when she was cooking, which was quite a big surprise for people who were watching. She explained to the clueless maidservants how, during her two years travelling in seminars from countries to countries, found many noble owned restaurants claimed to serve rendang but turned out to be dried curry. All the while sharply focused on doing her cooking duty.</p>\n<p>“Young lady!” from the crowd came out an angry bald man. He was Elder Jhamil. “W-what are you doing there?”</p>\n<p>“I’m cooking,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“But you can’t work there!” Elder Jhamil yelled. “No woman can substitute for patriarch! That’s against the rule!”</p>\n<p>“I don’t recall we have a rule like that.”</p>\n<p>“If you know why you still stand there?”</p>\n<p>“Neither do I recall a rule for an elder to use a stand-in for the Chief Chef position.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s face turned weird as if he suddenly got constipated. Many of the youngsters didn’t catch Bhela’s remarks nor they cared too much about it, but some in the crowd were nodding knowingly, as many of them were familiar with how shady Elder Jhamil was doing things.</p>\n<p>As the bald elder’s head was racing fast looking for an answer to defuse the young lady’s claim, suddenly, a loud roar exploded behind him.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela, who do you think you are? Just because your father is the family’s patriarch you think you can do whatever you want?!”</p>\n<p>The faces of aunties and the maidservants twitched. They witnessed how the young elder harassed the old man before, so they were itching to throw back the same question at him instead, though no more brave aunties dared to cause more troubles.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s son continued, “The ingredient for making Chief dishes takes money, young lady. Not even the patriarch himself has the daring to use coins from the treasury for himself. Do you want to embarrass your parents that much?”</p>\n<p>“I’m not making this food for myself nor I cook for my father. It’s for the guests. And I provided the spices and the foreign curry leaves by myself,” Bhela said. Some maidservants behind her nodded nervously as Bhela indeed ordered them to fetch spices from the personal kitchen in the main family’s residential area.</p>\n<p>In spite of that, the young elder kept pushing on with nasty smile on his face.</p>\n<p>“What about the chicken, young lady? They cost money! What do you say about that, huh?”</p>\n<p>Behind Bhela, the aunties, even the maidservants, were whispering at each other on how ridiculous it was to question the sole young generation of Malikh Family main bloodline over some chickens. Even Bhela, the young lady in question, would only glanced at the troubled expression of Elder Jhamil.</p>\n<p>“I will pay for the chicken,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Ha? Pay? With what? Your father’s money? Can’t a sick person even pay the cost of the foods for ngajen ceremony all by himself?”</p>\n<p>“No need to bring my father’s name here.” Bhela said with a dangerously cold tone.</p>\n<p>The chillness in her eyes was telling that she really did hate people bringing her parents’ name in bad faith. After hearing gasps of surprise from people that didn’t expect the usually silent young lady could utter something with such a biting tone, she sighed, said with an explanation, “I got a dress as a gift from a certain person who has too much money in his pocket. He said the dress is so valuable even the princesses wear them in parties. It should cover the cost of these chickens I’m going to cook if I sell the dress right here right now.”</p>\n<p>Bhela then tilted her head and glanced at the bald elder.</p>\n<p>“Am I right, Elder Jhamil?”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil wanted to maintain his smile, but his face went stiff as stone. He was trembling inside for knowing that the dress he acquired with a large sum of money and with his best connection, valued the same as some mere village chickens in Bhela’s eyes.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, his son, who was taken aback for a bit from the cold remark Bhela had said earlier, recovered, began to yell again, “Ha! Did you not train your brain when you were overseas, my young lady? The same dress princesses wear in parties? Only someone dumb believe that! Hah! Obviously you’ve been lied to! You’ve been crooked, young lady, crooked--”</p>\n<p><em>Paak!</em></p>\n<p>From behind, the already red-faced Elder Jhamil smacked his son’s head. “You’ve been rude to Young Lady Bhela, you dumbskull! You have to apologize! Young lady can’t bear to hear it anymore!”</p>\n<p>While in fact it was him who couldn’t bear to hear being called a crook.</p>\n<p>“Apologize!” Elder Jhamil roared.</p>\n<p><em>Splash!</em></p>\n<p>The pair father and son’s performance didn’t amuse Bhela, however. With the lid in her hand, Bhela scooped boiling curry broth and splashed it to their direction. Surprised, the stupid young elder swore with nasty words while his father cried in high-pitched voice.</p>\n<p>“Please get out,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil laughed wryly.</p>\n<p>“Please don’t be like that, young lady. I know my son doesn't have the best education but--”</p>\n<p><em>Splash!!</em></p>\n<p>Bhela waved the cooking lid once again as soon as Elder Jhamil stepped forward. The hot water splashed on his expensive boots. This time, while he didn’t expect for Bhela splashing hot water at him again, he wasn’t freaking out. It seemed his plan to make the young lady behave a little backfiring instead. His face turned solemn.</p>\n<p>“Young lady…”</p>\n<p>“I’m not going to say it thrice--everyone who has nothing to do in the kitchen, please get out,” Bhela said. “Or else--”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The major families’ lands were astonishingly spacious and complex, their walls were thick and tall, therefore each of them employed a few stationary guards for the main gate as gatekeepers. These gatekeepers, though usually filled by members of the outer part of the families, their duty were significantly more important than others since they represented the face of the family they served. So they always maintain polite gestures to everyone who came through their gate, either commoners or rich people from big families. Yet when Shira and Mila arrived the Malikh Family’s gatekeepers didn’t even hide their scoffs.</p>\n<p>“Ridiculous!” she hissed with a face boiled in anger, “even lowly gatekeepers are looking down on us!”</p>\n<p>“Don’t bother with them,” Shira said. Unlike his cousin’s furious temper, his flair seemed like he shrugged the blatant disrespect, as the holder of “Eternal Novice” title he was already numb by how people were talking behind his back.</p>\n<p>“If your father was here they’d bow their asses as soon as they saw us Yashura coming.”</p>\n<p>Shira shrugged his shoulders again.</p>\n<p>Still seething in anger, Mila cast her eyes on the banana leaves wrapped food in Shira’s hands. “Who should we give the rendang to?” she asked.</p>\n<p>“Let’s just give it to a random servant.” Then Shira called a maidservant who was carrying a tray full of food. “Excuse me!”</p>\n<p>“Yes? What can I help y--” The moment this maidservant turned her head and saw Shira’s face, she immediately threw back her eyes and escaped with hurried trot, pretending she saw nothing.</p>\n<p>“The fuck?!” Mila was flastergabbed, didn’t know what to say.</p>\n<p>Later on Shira and Mila realized how unpopular Yashura Family was to the current Malikhs, even the servants who usually held no voice in the family were avoiding the pair of cousins like plague. Their attitude especially worsened when it came to Shira Yashura.</p>\n<p>“Look there,” someone whispered amongst the guests, “Yashura Family send their eldest young miss and the young master! Out of all the Ngajen Ceremony, they choose tonight to show their faces--pretty obvious, eh? Bet they’re drooling to get another Unique Class after knowing our Young Lady Bhela’s real talent tonight!”</p>\n<p>Someone else agreed and replied, “With that kind of trash as their young master, they’d be dreamin’ to get even a touch of our Young Lady Bhela. Pueh!”</p>\n<p>Hearing the muffled disdain, Mila Yashura whirled her body, glaring people with eagle eyes. “Who said that?!” she growled.</p>\n<p>“Mila…” Shira held her shoulder.</p>\n<p>“The fuckers don’t even put our Yashura Family in their eyes. Just because shitty rumors about Unique Class they started to feel high and mighty, eh?”</p>\n<p>“Just let go, Uncle Shuro didn’t send us here to start troubles,” Shira said. “All we need to do is to show our faces here and give them our rendang. It’s not our problem whether they welcome our good intention with grace or not.”</p>\n<p>Though Shira said that, he secretly hoped Malikh Family would grow too proud to receive it--all so he had an excuse to keep his uncle’s rendang for himself.</p>\n<p>A commotion arose. People hussing here and there with excitement. When Shira and Mila wanted to know what was going on, a parade of beautiful young women glittering and stealing the whole show came from inside of Malikh Family’s hall. Leading them was a short-haired young beauty, face as icy as an ice sculpture, the recent name that everyone had been talking about these days, Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>It was clear from the way Bhela positioned herself she represented the family as the ceremony’s Chief Chef.</p>\n<p>“Whoa, so Malikh Family let her do that,” Shira murmured.</p>\n<p>Not to mention being the Chief Chef--the most Shira did in his family’s kitchen was helping his uncle, helping him shred coconuts. They were at the same age, but the same old Shira still practiced butchering goats while the supposed fiancée of his was climbing the social ladder. Even Mila was angry by the special treatment Malikh Family gave to their young lady.</p>\n<p>“Sup, young master!” from behind a voice called him.</p>\n<p>Shira turned around, found the one who greeted him was Monkey.</p>\n<p>“Who?” Mila asked Shira as the stranger with a monkey-like face approaching.</p>\n<p>“This one is called by the name of Monkey, young lady,” Monkey, with his self-trained Mossack’s style bowing gesture, introduced himself smoothly.</p>\n<p>Mila hummed in ackwnoledgement. It was harder to forget than remembering someone with such combination of face and awkward name.</p>\n<p>“Mister Monkey, I thought you’ll spend the ceremony to show Mister Snake around since he’s an outsider. What are you doing in Malikh Family?” Shira asked.</p>\n<p>“Now, now, please drop the ‘Mister’, young master. I’m not that old yet to be called as such,” Monkey said, then he continued explaining his story this evening. “We were planning to go to your family’s ceremony, young master. But who would have thought Snake to meet with his relatives here? His relatives are actually Malikh Family’s guests for tonight’s Ngajen Ceremony. Bet he got to eat expensive cuisines right now.”</p>\n<p>“Well, it’ll be easier with Mister Snake here. I’ve got some coins I want to show you, I wonder if it works to use them for--” Shira sneakily glanced at his cousin, then turned back to Monkey like it was nothing, “--for the thing we talked about yesterday.”</p>\n<p>Mila sneered, “You have some business to attend, no?”</p>\n<p>“Not really, no,” Shira shrugged off her question.</p>\n<p>“Really, though?” Mila crossed her arms, sneered again. “I think I saw Romana just now. I’mma chat with her a little bit.”</p>\n<p>It seemed to Shira that his cousin meeting with Romana here, in Malikh Family’s Ngajen Ceremony, wasn’t simply to have fun. He didn’t like his cousin would make trouble but he didn’t want to spend the whole night with her either. “Don’t go home without me,” he said eventually.</p>\n<p>“Hmph! You’re not a kid anymore but still need me to accompany you home?”</p>\n<p>No, Shira actually was more worried about her than himself.</p>\n<p>He then glanced beside and said, “Mister Monkey.”</p>\n<p>“Just Monkey,” Monkey corrected.</p>\n<p>“Mister Just Monkey, you said Mister Snake with relative? And his relatives are Malikh Family’s guests?”</p>\n<p>“Not Just Mon--ah, forget about it,” Monkey already gave up guessing whether Young Master Shira Yashura was purposely pulling his leg or not. “They really were Malikh Family’s guests, they even got the front row for the prayer and all.”</p>\n<p>“Is hard for us to be friendly if Mister Snake is involved with Malikh Family.”</p>\n<p>“You mean, that, huh? Well, I’ve been here for a while and they talked about you a lot, so I guess even someone as chill as you can get angry sometimes. But you don’t have to worry about those Malikhs, Young Master Shira. As long as their patriarch is Ghalim Malikh they won’t sever ties with Yashura so easily.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, is this your opinion?”</p>\n<p>“It’s Snake’s. It’s what he said before he met his relatives.”</p>\n<p>Shira thought the Alchemist he met once before was a total stranger of Badril Village, but it appeared he was wrong. “He really does know about Malikh Family that much, doesn’t he?”</p>\n<p>“Well, yeah, but I think he’s more familiar with Yashura than Malikh Family, though,” Monkey said, crossing his arms and nodded to himself as he recalled things that Snake told him to get his wares supported by Yashura Family; for example, obtaining Butler Yulong’s permission the same as Patriarch Shuro Yashura’s, Snake once said.</p>\n<p>“What? Why do you make that kind of face, Young Master Shira?” Monkey was snapped from his train of thought.</p>\n<p>“Ah, no, I just don’t expect you’re going to say some like that.”</p>\n<p>“What are you saying, young master. In the first place, Snake became my crew because he heard I’ve some dealing with Yashura Family.”</p>\n<p>Shira did recall the first time Monkey contacted Yashura Family--through him. To be more exact, the first item Monkey dealt from Malikh Family was Shira’s smuggled erotic painting that Good-Natured Spirit rejected.</p>\n<p>“--Speaking of Snake,” with his thumb Monkey did point in a certain direction. The place was separated from the common guest as they indeed were Malikh Family’s special guests. Shira’s eyes followed and he saw the familiar Alchemist he knew not long ago, Snake, was talking with two men, young and old, most likely brother and his grandfather.</p>\n<p>“Don’t be fooled by their appearances, young master. They’re renowned experts,” Monkey said.</p>\n<p>The pair of brother and grandfather wore worn out pale robes as their clothes, unlike the image of revered experts in Shira’s mind. Monkey told him both likely to travel incognito for various reasons. The old man had an old white hair and long beard, his back crooked and had to bring a walking staff to support himself, and gave people the impression of a sleepy grandpa from the dim light on his eyes. The young one though, had an always angry-looking face with fierce brows, crossing his muscle-thick arms, locked in a debate with Snake. Snake’s face was notably paler than when Shira met him in the market.</p>\n<p>“We can’t greet Mister Snake now, can we?” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think we can,” Monkey said. Even though he long considered Snake as his partner, the two guests appearing incognito were still the main members of the revered Alchemist family. This was no time for commoners like him acting friendly on them all of the sudden.</p>\n<p>The sleepy-looking old man, noticing two pairs of eyes looking at him, he raised his head. He caught the sight of Shira. Their eyes met.</p>\n<p>“Oh ho,” the old man smiled when he found the boy. He dragged his old body to approach the flastergabbed Shira and Monkey.</p>\n<p>Even Monkey who knew more about them wouldn’t expect Snake’s relatives to introduce themselves first.</p>\n<p>“He’s heading this way…”</p>\n<p>“Ah, yes, apparently.”</p>\n<p>Monkey gulped. “It’s different with Snake. Although he looked like that, whatever you do, please, young master, you can’t afford to be rude in front of this elder…”</p>\n<p>From the nervousness in Monkey’s voice Shira found the approaching old man seemed to hail from a more prestigious family than he originally thought.</p>\n<p>“Greeting, elder,” Shira said with his head humbly lowered as soon as he approached.</p>\n<p>The old man chuckled, patted Shira’s head, said, “Ah, Young Master, look how much you’ve grown. It feels like only yesterday how happy you were running around like a little kid you are.”</p>\n<p>Shira nodded hearing that. He glanced beside him, and caught Monkey’s face flabbergasted looking both at the boy and the old man.</p>\n<p>Hiding his embarrassment behind a fake cough, Shira then tried to understand whether the old man mistook him for someone else. “I’m sorry, elder. I don’t know if I’m mistaken, but, have we met before?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, have we met? Of course we’ve--” he stopped. The old man's eyes were covered by a pair of soft hands of a girl.</p>\n<p>“Guess who this is?” the girl who sneakily teased the old man from behind was grinning.</p>\n<p>“Oho! Who is this? Who is this?” the old man smiled delightedly.</p>\n<p>Both Shira and Monkey were tense watching the scene before them. Especially Shira Yashura, who knew that the grin on his cousin’s face always told that the girl enjoyed herself a little bit too much.</p>\n<p>“Isn’t this… Tomboy Princess?” the old man guessed.</p>\n<p>“Tuut! Wrong!”</p>\n<p>Mila released her hands. When the old man turned to see the preparator, he exclaimed with a chuckle.</p>\n<p>“It’s really you, Tomboy Princess.”</p>\n<p>Mila excitedly echoed, “It’s really you, Grandpa Piss!”</p>\n<p>They were so glad they met after a long time that they started to hug each other. Then Mila pull herself from the oldman’s embrace, yelling, “Ugghh…” she pinched her nose, “I smell something pissy around here.”</p>\n<p>Just when Shira and Monkey wondered what Mila meant by that, the girl looked at the old man, saying, “It’s no wonder it smells pissy. Have you taken a bath, Grandpa Piss.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss answered with a laugh. But Shira and Monkey facepalmed.</p>\n<p>So much for being mindful in front of the revered old expert.</p>\n<p>Shira awkwardly smiled to cover his shame. “Mila, you should be mindful in front of elders.”</p>\n<p>“Mindful?” Mila gasped. “In front of Grandpa Piss? Why?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, it’s okay, young master,” the old man said as he waved his hand. “I’m not that old to lose my sense of humor. Yashura Family’s princess sure is as naughty as always.” His wrinkles deepened as he curled his lips into a big smile. He said to Mila, “I reckon Patriarch Shuro’s been well, my princess? I recall he got a lot of migraines back in the day.”</p>\n<p>Haughtily, Mila replied, “Don’t worry about that guy, Grandpa Piss. His brain capacity has been declining these past years so there’s really nothing left inside to give him any headache!”</p>\n<p>“Ehem,” Shira cleared his phlegm. “She meant our patriarch has been well, elder.”</p>\n<p>“That’s what I said,” Mila laughed, and the old man laughed too. After that Mila kissed Grandpa Piss’s right hand as if she was kissing an elder’s hand from her own family, then continued laughing as cheeky as always.</p>\n<p>“My naughty princess,” Grandpa Piss ruffled Mila’s hair, “I planned to visit Yashura Family later. But since we’ve already met, here, please take this.”</p>\n<p>Receiving a pack wrapped in dried leaves, Mila pouted her lips. “You wouldn’t be lying about this being a candy again, would you?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, of course not.”</p>\n<p>As far as her memory served her well, what Grandpa Piss called candy actually a really bitter herb for young children to gain their appetite. Mila sniffed. She opened it and have a little taste. “Uuueeekk!”</p>\n<p>It was sour and even more bitter than she remembered. “What the hell is this?!”</p>\n<p>“That herb’s not for consumption, Young Lady Mila” the big man with muscles, Snake’s big brother, said from behind Grandpa Piss. He was smiling politely despite the other party merely a young lady of a rural village. “It’s a cosmetic for skin care.”</p>\n<p>“Skin care?!”</p>\n<p>Mila’s mouth widened agape. But soon as she glanced at the muscle man who was approaching her, she became wary, leaned to Grandpa Piss and whispered, “Grandpa Piss, who’s that?”</p>\n<p>With a patient smile replied, Grandpa Piss said, “He’s Snotty. Don’t you remember Snotty?”</p>\n<p>Mila was surprised. “Oooohh! Snotty! You’ve turned into a real man now I can’t even recognize you anymore!”</p>\n<p>“Haha… you’re surely jest young lady,” Snotty said.</p>\n<p>“No, really…” with fingers on her chin, eyes on muscles, Mila added, “you really transformed into something new, Snotty. I’m impressed. You were so skinny and really a snotty boy back then.”</p>\n<p>The man continued to laugh. The atmosphere was friendly and harmless. Yet Monkey, who had long heard Snotty’s real identity and preceding reputation from Snake’s mouth, began sweating profusely.</p>\n<p>Mila really loved gifted cosmetics and the like. After knowing how effective it was for her beauty, she shamelessly asked, “Can I ask for more, Grandpa Piss? I have a good friend who needs to be a beauty--as soon as possible!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, of course I have more--here, take this,” Grandpa Piss took out another one.</p>\n<p>“Waow!” Mila’s eyes sparkled in a weird glint. Shira, who saw that, knew his cousin’s greed began to surface; suddenly the unruly young lady acted as if she was a timid maiden. “Grandpa Piss… I think my other friend needs it too…” she asked sweetly.</p>\n<p>“Hohoh!” Grandpa Piss stroked his beard again. “Unfortunately, my princess, I’ve got only three pack and I planned to give the last one for Young Lady Malikh.”</p>\n<p>Hearing a certain short-haired girl being mentioned, the shy maiden’s face twisted in an ugly sour face, returned back to her original color. “Tch.”</p>\n<p>“Hey, don’t click your tongue in front of elders,” Shira warned her.</p>\n<p>“Tch.” Mila crossed her arms and threw away her pouting face.</p>\n<p>Shira was always frustrated whenever a younger one like him would be the one to reprimand ethics into this blockhead of a girl.</p>\n<p>“Now, now, young lady. Please remember Grandpa’s already too old to concoct too many cosmetics--getting two packs already good enough,” Snotty said.</p>\n<p>Snake looked at the leaves wrapped cosmetics in Mila’s hands and exclaimed, “Grandfather concocted them himself?”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss nodded with an amiable smile. “Of course. Been twelve years since the last time I was here. It’d be embarrassing if I came with half-hearted gifts, don’t you think so?”</p>\n<hr>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>The nickname of “Grandpa Piss” stuck on Grandmaster Alchemist’s name for twelve years. When a friend of his asked the origin of this horrible nickname, the Grandmaster laughed it off and said a princess of his old friend’s family started calling him that, because her cousin who was still a three years old brat urinated on him every time the Grandmaster tried to hug him.</p>\n<p>Legend said that the princess was also calling the heir of Grandmaster Alchemist’s family with the nickname of “Snotty”. But even to this day, nobody knows which kingdom this cheeky princess comes from.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n","volume-1/chapter-4-5":"<p>Badril Village, though had been two years passed without her presence, was the same as always for Bhela Malikh. She hadn’t that many acquaintances her age she could consider friendly before. In spite of that, from the day she returned, people act as if they were her rekindled childhood friends she never knew she had.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” a daughter of an elder from Elzhier Family asked curiously, “is the rumor about that story true?”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at her with eyelids half-closed.</p>\n<p>“Which rumor?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, silly you, of course <em>that</em> rumor! The one about your romance with a blue blood noble!”</p>\n<p>Giggles of girls followed after the girl’s words. When Bhela returned to Badril Village she brought not only fame and reputation, but interesting stories and rumors as well. She was currently surrounded by curious young ladies who sought for exciting gossip.</p>\n<p>“Yeah, yeah!” another girl excitedly hussing in low voice. “I heard he’ll attend Malikh’s ngajen ceremony tonight!”</p>\n<p>“Really?”</p>\n<p>“Why else would Young Lady Bhela take the Chef Chief position if she didn’t expect for her lover to come tonight? He’ll come for sure!”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, yeah, everybody is saying Young Lady Bhela doing just for that!”</p>\n<p>Bhela found it was amazing how people could conjure their own rumors despite not seeing the true story by their own eyes.</p>\n<p>And just when the young ladies started getting excited discussing Young Lady Bhela’s ‘love life’, a vigorous shout resounded the courtyard announcing that Blackwood Family had arrived.</p>\n<p>“Blackwood Family?” someone cocked their head and looked over the direction of the gate. “What kind of family is so bold announcing their names in other family’s ngajen ceremony? Not even Village Head’s Elzhier Family would do to the ceremony host!”</p>\n<p>“Only foreigners to be that stupid to be rude in big family like Malikh! If this is my place I’d send a guard to kick their ass out as soon as possible!”</p>\n<p>“Look over there! Malikh Family elders are rushing to the gate! Let’s check out how’s Malikhs going to deal with it!”</p>\n<p>Curious guests were tailing the elders to see some commotion they thought would occur. However, not only did the Malikhs not make a fuss over it, they even bowed their heads toward the newly arrived noble as if they were servants greeting their returning master. Young people were overly excited because nobles were foreign and appeared in stories all of their lives.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Mila, who already went back with her friend, was gritting teeth with anger. Beside her Romana was holding the tomboy back, though concerned she didn't say a word.</p>\n<p>“Why should I am the one who always had to hold myself back?” Mila hissed in a low voice as if she was wronged.</p>\n<p>“Look around and think about who’s receiving the blow the most. Everyone’s talking about your cousin right now--do you want to make it worse for him?”</p>\n<p>After hearing her friend’s warning, Mila began to take a deep breath and think things through. Romana was right. When she opened her ears Mila could hear people comparing the young master of this noble Blackwood Family with her cousin Shira. They compared such a gallant-looking young noble with a trash of Yashura Family young master, adding with their own biased seasoning here and there, making her cousin Shira look really bad. Mila trembled as her face boiled red from holding back her anger.</p>\n<p>“Where’s Shira right now?”</p>\n<p>“I think he went hiding!” Romana said.</p>\n<p>“Hiding?! He’s embarrassed to show his face that much?”</p>\n<p>After circling around a bit, Mila found the boy’s silhouette in the shadow far from the braziers' light. There, he was squatting, hiding along with two other silhouettes who were also squatting in a suspicious manner.</p>\n<p>“Now, young master, where the hell did you get this coin?” someone whispered from the suspicious bunch.</p>\n<p>The reply came also in the same hushed manner. “Don’t ask me now, just know I’ve got a few more hidden in my house. I can’t move my family, but if you’re fine with this, I can invest in your goods earlier.”</p>\n<p>“We’re fine? Of course we’re fine! Don’t you know how amazing this coin is?”</p>\n<p>“It’s amazing? I can’t even buy satays with this. Nobody here would receive unfamiliar currency.”</p>\n<p>“But don’t you know how far ahead you can go if merchants know you grab some of these coins?”</p>\n<p>“You tell me.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, these coins weren’t issued by any countries, but they’re valuable. Lots of herbs and ingredients in the black markets can only be bought with these coins...”</p>\n<p><em>...whisper whisper whisper...</em></p>\n<p>Mila approached.</p>\n<p>“Ey, what are you doing?!”</p>\n<p>For some reasons, Shira and Monkey, one of his companions, almost jumped in fright by her barking. Both Mila and Romana behind her saw Shira and Monkey were acting suspicious--but Sneak, the third silhouette, didn’t even try to hide that he was nibbling on something delicious.</p>\n<p>Mila, with a weird face, hissed, “Is that… <em>rendang</em> you guys were eating?”</p>\n<p>“<em>Cough, cough,</em>” hiding the opened wrapping banana leaves, Shira awkwardly trying to make an excuse, “I think Malikh Family is too eager to cut off relationships with our Yashura Family so… I reckon they don’t need this anymore…”</p>\n<p>Mila was so angry she slapped the banana leaves in Shira’s hand.</p>\n<p>“Ah, my rendang…”</p>\n<p>“Your rendang?! You goddamn moron!” Mila hissed, she didn’t dare to roar and announce themselves to other guests. “You’re about to get cuckolded and all you think about is a goddamn rendang?!”</p>\n<p>“Young master, someone trying to get you cuckolded?” licking his fingers for some leftover rendang sauce, Snake asked from the side.</p>\n<p>Shira shook his head. “Cuckold is a very strong word. That girl didn’t even consider me from the beginning. It’s not like we're a married couple yet.”</p>\n<p>He then came to pick the spoiled beef and mourned, “ah… my poor rendang.”</p>\n<p>“Stop crying over that shit! It’s not important!”</p>\n<p>Monkey blurted, “Rendang is not important?”</p>\n<p>Mila glared at Monkey. The monkey-faced peddler closed his mouth as soon as he opened it.</p>\n<p>Romana saw her friend Mila had a bad affinity with her cousin whenever she was angry, thus came to explain from the side, “Young Master Shira, don’t you know people outside the Mossack culture do take engagement seriously? It’s understandable for a young heir of a conservative family like Yashura to not care much about it--but, whatever your feelings regarding your engagement is, if Young Lady Bhela has an affair outside, she’ll also drag down Yashura Family’s reputation. So please be mindful about it more for the sake of your family.”</p>\n<p>They didn’t really think about this deeply since straightforward Mossack people were the type to have children before they were even married. If things went awry, Shira reckoned his uncle and the elders in his family might think the engagement matter was similar to puppy love, about children bantering, but the young generation who was exposed to stories and gossips from books and travellers might think about it differently. And someone who didn’t hang out so much like Shira wouldn’t be able to tell how these youngsters would talk about this incident in the future.</p>\n<p>So Shira stood up and patted his trouser, admitted, “Ah, you’re right, Romana.”</p>\n<p>Mila crossed her arms. Frowning at her cousin. “What are you gonna do now? Fight them? No need to be afraid, I’m with you.”</p>\n<p>Snake, still squatting comfortably, added, “Young Master, my grandfather and my older brother are still here too. You won’t be at a disadvantage in case things go downhill.”</p>\n<p>“It’s decided. Let’s kick their asses!” Mila growled.</p>\n<p>“The heck are you talking about kicking people’s asses in Ngajen Ceremony?” Shira grunted.</p>\n<p>“Then at least let me slap that slut’s arrogant face!”</p>\n<p>Shira shook his head.</p>\n<p>“Let’s go,” he said.</p>\n<p>“We’re gonna slap her face now?” Mila asked.</p>\n<p>“No. We at least have to make Family Yashura’s presence known here,” Shira said. He caught his companions’ confused expressions, so he added, “Everyone is getting excited because most of them are young'uns. But if this incident gets out of the hands, the elders from other families won’t be silent about it.”</p>\n<p>Mila wanted to say something but didn’t after seeing Shira’s relaxed face. She didn’t want to say something silly that’d change the boy’s mind. Therefore, with Shira leading the way, she and her friend Romana went to see the ruckus caused by the noble’s arrival. Leaving Monkey and Sneak who were silent looking at their back.</p>\n<p>The two exchanged glances.</p>\n<p>They looked down, eyes sweeping the ground.</p>\n<p>“Mm?” Monkey mumbled, his hands crawling all over the dirt.</p>\n<p>Snake took out a magic wand. The wand shimmered with a gentle light, then he used that to give some light to the ground where the rendang was spoiled.</p>\n<p>But it was Monkey who shouted in joy, “I got one!”</p>\n<p>“Give me that!” Snake pounced the moment he saw Monkey rubbed the dirt of a piece of rendang.</p>\n<p>Pushing out Snake’s face from grabbing the rendang in his hand, Monkey felt wronged and cried, “Why would a rich gentleman like you fight over a single beef with this poor peddler? Don’t you know my family can only afford to eat beef once a year?”</p>\n<p>“Why, you asked?” Snake sneered, “There’s no need to say the obvious. You don’t get to eat Patriarch Shuro’s handmade rendang everyday! And I’m saying this after starving for beef ever since I’m following you.”</p>\n<p>“Fuck off!”</p>\n<p>“Give me that!”</p>\n<p>“No!”</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the shadowy corner where they were wrestling came to be lightened up with a lit torch.</p>\n<p>“Ehem, you two gentlemen,” a voice called.</p>\n<p>For a moment, Monkey and Snake stopped fighting.</p>\n<p>The voice owner was a man with Malikh Family’s servant uniform. Reluctantly, he continued, “Badril Village locals are usually open-minded and tolerant people. However, we have a bottom line. If you two couldn’t hold it you should rent some inn room or do it in the bushes! Don’t do it in the open, you’re making people uncomfortable! Know some shame!”</p>\n<p>Monkey at first didn’t get what the servant was talking about. Then he realized during infighting over the rendang, he had opened his legs, and Snake was on top of him in a very, very awkward manner.</p>\n<p>“Dammit!” he kicked Snake and trembling over the horror he caught himself in. But suddenly he noticed the rendang in his hand already vanished. He whirled his head around. Snake was already licking his fingers with a satisfied face.</p>\n<p>“Dammit!” Monkey howled again.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The one who enthusiastically greeted the young noble of Blackwood Family was Elder Jhamil instead of Bhela Malikh. He managed to conjure thirty years worth of bullshitting skills to flatter and fawn over the other party, rather thick faced to continue despite the young master of noble family rolled his eyes several times. As soon as the young noble caught the sight of a short-haired girl he immediately escaped from Elder Jhamil’s clutch with a big grin on his face.</p>\n<p>“Ah, Sister Bhela!”</p>\n<p>“Young Master Frane Blackwood.”</p>\n<p>“How are you doing Young Lady Bhela? Fancy to meet you again,” he said as he gifted the girl a flower.</p>\n<p>Bhela received the flower but then immediately passed it to a random maidservant beside her. She said as if it was nothing, “I’m fine. Thank you.”</p>\n<p>Young Master Frane Blackwood smiled wryly. “I’ve been travelling with hardly any rest so that I can see you sooner, my young lady,” the young master of Blackwood Family, Frane Blackwood, said, “may I be so lucky to receive your company tonight?”</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry, but here the words ‘tonight’s companion’ have different meanings than when you say it in the western-style ball--so, no, Young Master Blackwood, I can’t give you company tonight,” she said.</p>\n<p>The young noble still had a smile and wanted to correct his wording, but Bhela suddenly raised her hand and said, “Excuse me.”</p>\n<p>She went past him and greeted another pair of guests instead.</p>\n<p>“Greeting, sir, madam.”</p>\n<p>“It’s about time,” the middle-aged man didn’t answer Bhela’s greeting, but complained instead. “You know the other families had begun their ceremonies, right? Even though we don’t have the same ceremony as your Ngajen Ceremony from the place where I come from, but I know those who don’t take any old ceremonies seriously only brought bad luck over their lands.”</p>\n<p>There was a rare restraint in Bhela’s voice as she replied, “I apologize for our bad conduct, Sir Instructor. I will request the elders to proceed with the ceremony. Please let me lead you toward the reserved spot I previously prepared for both of you.”</p>\n<p>“Lead the way then.”</p>\n<p>Badril Village locals witnessed the valiant Young Lady of Malikh Family taking charge of the Ngajen Ceremony as the Chief Chef, but with the appearance of her bowing to two unfamiliar guests as well, whispers were floating amongst the Ngajen Ceremony guests. Before long, everyone knew that two guests Bhela Malikh greeted were the ones she personally invited, but was neglected before the family’s gate because of the excitement made by the noble’s arrival. Bhela came to them to apologize in person.</p>\n<p>Young Master Frane Blackwood, who felt ignored, pulled a self-decrepitating sneer. He complained to Elder Jhamil instead, “Oh, Malikh Family elder, can you tell me the identity of those two guests who made even Young Lady Bhela to bow her head?”</p>\n<p>“Ehem, ehem,” Elder Jhamil didn’t know what to answer, so he concocted a reply out of thin air, “I think they were relatives from her maternal family.”</p>\n<p>“Is that so? From the way they are dressed, they don’t look from that respectable background enough to get the young lady’s full attention. Don’t you think so?”</p>\n<p>“Young noble is right. Young Lady Bhela’s father once was a gangster thus he didn’t manage to teach common sense to the young lady. I’ll talk to her later to explain what’s really important.”</p>\n<p>After a bit of excuse and fawning, Young Master Blackwood felt this Elder Jhamil was acceptable. He told the Blackwood Family’s servants to bring the gifts he had prepared, which were naturally accepted by Elder Jhamil on the young lady’s behalf. In the meantime, people were disappointed that the drama they were expecting didn’t happen. But what could they do besides shaking their heads and disperse?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Year after year, the ngajen ceremony evolved from stiff sessions of praying ceremony for village safety to the new stylish festivities of foods and happy times for the youngsters, where fads and trends emerge. However big their way of life was changing the conservative major families, Yashura and Elzhier, still pretty much followed the old ways, especially when it came to the prayers. Only Malikh Family amongst the three that eager to embrace the new world that was coming. And by Elder Jhamil’s direction, instead of local shamans, Malikh Family asked help from foreign priests from western orthodox temples from nearby villages to lead the prayer.</p>\n<p>It was all good if one made a progressive decision with the greater good in mind. But here was the problem; orthodox temple priests usually led prayers for abundant harvest, while Ngajen Ceremony was all about calming Selaqs from descending the mountain. These priests probably hadn’t any clue how Selaqs looked like.</p>\n<p>“It was inappropriate for a noble to pray to old Mossack deities they don’t believe in, that was Malikhs’ excuses,'' Mila complained non-stop since they finished praying with other guests. In her hands--like a young mother hugging her baby--were plates of food she had just plundered from Malikh Family’s banquet tables prepared to entertain guests.</p>\n<p>“What deity? Wasn’t the mantra replaced from ancient Mossack prayers to magic spell mantra to calm down Selaq since… I don’t know, fifty years ago?” Romana said. The food in her hands was no less than Mila’s. These two girls seemed to think Malikh Family would regret offending them if they plunder the latter’s prepared feast like no tomorrow.</p>\n<p>“That's what I was saying! We no longer those ancient Mossacks who would sacrifice relatives so Selaqs won’t come down the mountain! Nowadays we’ve been using legit spells to keep all those Selaqs away, and these stupid Malikhs want to change the tradition just to appease some visiting noble? They’d rather avoid their noble guest to be uncomfortable than preventing Selaqs from coming down to chew their stupid brains, hah!”</p>\n<p>Compared to noisy girls beside him, Shira was able to keep his head to his feet. Romana signaled Mila with her eyes when she realized the boy wasn’t so into retaliating against the Malikhs; instead of invading the feast Shira, grabbed Malikh Family’s snacks moderately whenever he could--just like any other normal guests that came here.</p>\n<p>Mila grumbled with a bad mood, faced Shira and said, “Don’t you have something you need to do?”</p>\n<p>“Like what?” Shira hoped this cheeky cousin of his wouldn’t say something about kicking people’s asses again.</p>\n<p>“We can’t wait for something to happen,” she said. “Go ask that bitc--I mean, that fiancée of yours--go ask for a dance. The young’uns are starting to get heated. Look there, one of them couples are dancing. You go join them since that short-haired cunt is your fiancée after all.”</p>\n<p>Mila glanced around for a while before she realized she just had her tongue slipped. She quickly corrected her previous words, “Did I say cunt? I mean short-haired bitch--no, short-haired <em>young lady</em>.”</p>\n<p>“Why don’t you just be honest with yourself here. People have been calling Malikhs much worse here because the foreign priests matter!” Romana laughed.</p>\n<p>At that moment a very young maidservant of Malikh Family just passed by and overheard their conversation. The little maidservant snorted in anger, which made Mila snorted back as a retort.</p>\n<p>“Go, go! Go dance with her!” Mila whispered when she was sure only Shira and Romana were around.</p>\n<p>Shira clicked his tongue. “I don’t even have a single proper conversation with her these past ten years. Why should I go ask her dance out of the blue? Just showing our face around here is enough.”</p>\n<p>“Fool! If she accepted to dance with you then all is good, that would only confirm Malikh Family’s cocky attitude is only because their dipshit brains are getting fried by their own inflated proud ego, nothing serious! But if she ignores you in front of others… heh--she dares!”</p>\n<p>“That’s easy for you to say. If someone you don’t like suddenly asks your hands for a dance, what would you feel later on when you found out refusing means two families become enemies?”</p>\n<p>“Uh-uh, I don’t feel nothing. If he’s my fiancé then it’s my job to go my way out to make it clear in public! Going dancing, going kissing, like a proper damned couple! That’s what the goddamn engagement is all about! Right?”</p>\n<p>Mila ate a cookie and she blinked. Unsure of the previous words she said, she glanced at Romana and murmured, “...right?”</p>\n<p>Romana shrugged.</p>\n<p>But Shira wouldn’t back down easily. He continued arguing, “What if your fiancé is Bony Elzhier, then? Are you going to kiss him to prove he’s your fiancé?”</p>\n<p>Mila hid her gasp.</p>\n<p>“You wanna die?” she pursed her lips. “Listen to me or I’m gonna smack your face!”</p>\n<p>Shira groaned against his cousin’s unreasonableness. But before he could concoct a satisfying retort, Snake and Monkey came out of nowhere.</p>\n<p>“Oh, Young Master Shira,” Monkey came patting him on the shoulder, “it seems you get cuckolded for real this time.”</p>\n<p>People were clapping and whistling as the flashy Young Master Frane Blackwood led Young Lady Bhela Malikh by the hand.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Malikh was entertaining two guests previously, but that bald elder raised a fuss about how she neglected the young noble, so in the end it came to this.”</p>\n<p>Monkey laughed as he teased Shira with his elbow, “They’re going to dance. When two people were dancing in Ngajen Ceremony, that meant they--” he caught the scary experssion on Mila’s face, stopped, “nevermind…”</p>\n<p>“That slut!” Mila hissed.</p>\n<p>This was getting serious. Whenever Mila showed that kind of face something bad would happen. Again, the moment Shira opened his mouth to say something, someone else came to grab him in the shoulder.</p>\n<p>“Brat, your woman is going to cuckold you in public,” said the newcomer, Good-Natured Spirit, who literally came out of the thin air.</p>\n<p>“You too?”</p>\n<p>Shira had a headache. Both Monkey and Snake couldn’t see the annoying Good-Natured Spirit, but the three of them were in harmony in mocking him. They mocked him to the point saying he wouldn’t care would only embarrass him further.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, being led by the hand, Bhela Malikh asked Young Master Blackwood, “What kind of remedy Blackwood Family brought with you?”</p>\n<p>“Why so much in hurry, my young lady?” the young noble gave a laugh and a flash of smile. “No need to worry, Blackwood Family sympathize with the disaster that befell your father, so my mother send me here to personally deliver the medicine Blackwood House had sought far and wide.”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh said nothing more. The Young Master of Blackwood Family pondered as he read the cold expression of the girl, thinking that even with flowers and jewelry gifts, nothing could move this young lady. Such a waste of that beautiful face to not letting a single smile escaped, Young Master Blackwood could only smacked his lips and shook his head. But as soon as he mentioned a medicine he brought for her father, the feisty young lady became amiable almost immediately.</p>\n<p>Good thing for him. Bhela Malikh was talented, the Blackwood Family planned to have her inside their house, and if things went this smoothly he could do that his mother told him sooner than he expected.</p>\n<p>“Little bitch of Malikh Family,” a girl roared, “you finally show your true color you bitch! Is Yashura Family a joke to you?!”</p>\n<p>The furious Mila Yashura became the center of attention. She snorted as she strode, like an angry bull preparing to charge, with the mood that would make the crowd wordlessly give way to her. Not only because they didn’t want anything to do with the infamous young lady of Yashura Family--who, when angry, once punched Bony in the face with a nosebleed--but also because she got a sword in her hands.</p>\n<p>Shira glanced down. His father’s sword he brought with him was gone. He looked again at the unsheated weapon in his cousin’s hands.</p>\n<p>He could only slap his own face the moment he noticed what was happened.</p>\n<p>Mila took a step forward slowly, but her face turned even fiercer. She spoke, “You got guts to bring a lover from outside, eh? I knew something fishy happened when I saw you cut your hair, you little slut.”</p>\n<p>“I cut my hair because it got in the way during my training,” Bhela replied plainly. “And this is not my lover. Just a relative of my friend.”</p>\n<p>“You lying little slut. As if someone like you have any friends!”</p>\n<p>“I do have a friend.” Bhela said. A rare emphasizing tone in her voice was telling that she was upset, but she held back from explaining further.</p>\n<p>“I don’t care what your excuse is! Do you think I don’t know what you shitty Malikhs up to? You already don’t put Yashura Family in your eyes, eh? Just because you bitch have a little vacation outside, eh? If you think you’re a big shot, why don’t you prove it here and now?!”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh was silent for a while. Looking at Mila, she then asked, “And what are you suggesting I should do, Young Lady Yashura?”</p>\n<p>Mila stabbed her sword into the ground.</p>\n<p>“I just want to know how awesome is this Archer class you’ve got overseas that makes you Malikhs stop putting us Yashuras in your eyes,” Mila sneered. “Why don’t we test it with my sword, eh? Let’s do a duel, bitch.”</p>\n<p>Bhela just looked at Mila strangely.</p>\n<p>“But you’re a Specialist class,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Aha! Getting scared, aren’t ya, you little cunt?”</p>\n<p>Bhela didn’t want to argue with her. So she told the nearest servant to go grab a bow.</p>\n<p>On the other side, Monkey anxiously elbowed Shira, said, “Should I drag your cousin back?”</p>\n<p>“Stand down, mister. Mila is the one who’s starting it. She can’t afford to back down now.”</p>\n<p>Beside them Snake was nodding as he understood what Shira meant.</p>\n<p>Then with a laugh, Good-Natured Spirit, who was already tired jeering him, said to Shira. “Kid, shit just got real. Ain’t that a good idea to pull her before it’s too late?”</p>\n<p>Shira wanted to but he couldn’t. He knew exactly Mila’s strength. Fighting bare hands, she might get a chance to stand against the strongest youngster in the village, but it would become a different story when weapons and mana were involved.</p>\n<p>Since Mila was the one to propose the duel, bailing out before the fight began would be slapping her own face in front of the guests. It was a bad idea, because Mila didn’t appear to have the slightest chance to win. So bad that it’d be more reasonable to just surrender. But Shira knew Mila hated to go back on her words the most. Thus he silently moved closer to her, prepared to pull her back in before the situation really got out of his hands.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Young Master Blackwood, was pulled out by an adjutant of his family.</p>\n<p>Smirking, he asked the adjutant, “Who is that girl who picking a fight with Bhela?”</p>\n<p>“Seems like the eldest young lady of that family,” the adjutant replied.</p>\n<p>“You mean the family my Bhela got engaged to?” Young Master Frane Blackwood asked as if Bhela already his. The corner of his lips curled as he thought this might be a good chance to do something on the engagement that Blackwood House already saw as a thorn in their eyes. “Do you have something on that girl?”</p>\n<p>“Replying to young master, since Yashura Family is the main obstacle for us to get Young Lady Bhela Malikh to our side, your mother has already sent someone to investigate them. The eldest young lady of Yashura Family merely a Level 10 Specialist class who just graduated from Novice about seven months ago.”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood couldn’t help but chuckle. Even though the two young ladies had the same level, a Specialist merely support class that wasn’t suited in combat. This duel affair would turn out to be a joke.</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood scoffed. “Let my Bhela teach her some manners. I don’t want anyone to disturb us after this.”</p>\n<p>“Young master,” the adjutant lowered his voice, “I don’t think that’s a good idea.”</p>\n<p>“What’s on your mind, adjutant?”</p>\n<p>“I just made a round to check the guests attending this ceremony, and I found…”--he lowered his voice--“...some spectators amongst the guests that shouldn’t have be here….”</p>\n<p>“Go on,” the young noble urged.</p>\n<p>“I just received the word, young master, there are experts that Elder Jhamil said he didn’t invite.”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood frowned. “What… what’s that supposed to mean?”</p>\n<p>On the less crowded place of the courtyard, the middle-aged man who Bhela greeted before, along with the middle-aged woman, watched the commotion unfold while nibbling on steamed peanuts. He glanced at the other place where a man calmly sipping tea, a man with a hard face who couldn’t hide his sharp aura, then swept his gaze at the one who beside him, a short stature man who wore a headband to hide his reddish hair from public, who also happened to enjoy steamed peanuts while his focus solely at one direction in the crowd.</p>\n<p>All of them came in common garments incognito. But still Elder Jhamil sent people to keep tabs on them, especially since the bald elder still didn’t know the reason Bhela Malikh invited these foreigners.</p>\n<p>The ngajen ceremony usually consisted of three main parts--prayer, socializing, and sending offerings to the mountain as the finale. It was uncommon for irrelevant events to happen between them. However, since the young lady of the host had already accepted the duel, Malikh Family set up an emergency venue for the fight.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil came to invite himself as the judge. For a change to hummiliate those simple Yashuras and to slip himself onto the spotlight, he couldn’t ask for better opportunity.</p>\n<p>“You two ready?” Elder Jhamil asked both of the opposing sides. “This is a friendly match between two friendly families. So stop before your blade hit your enemy,” he said, seemingly talking to either sides, but didn’t say anything about the arrows part.</p>\n<p>Since Bhela Malikh was an Archer, she suggested to Mila, “I’m using a bow. So you can move first. I’ll try to dodge for ten seconds.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t need that,” Mila scoffed.</p>\n<p>“Very well…” she said. She glanced at Elder Jhamil, said, “Elder Jhamil, please begin the duel.&quot;</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil counted to three.</p>\n<p>The duel began.</p>\n<p>“AAAAAA!!!” Mila roared with the sword raised above her head, charging ahead.</p>\n<p>Contrast to her opponent’s battle cry, Bhela was solemn. She picked four arrows from the quiver tied on her hips. Nocking the arrows simultaneously, she took a deep breath as she concentrated to channel different natures elemental mana from her manasphere. The mana, through fingers and her thumb, flowing into all the four arrows and soon the tip of the arrows glowed with four different colors.</p>\n<p>The wind began to stir.</p>\n<p>And she raised the bow. She released the arrows.</p>\n<p><em>Fuuush fuuuushhh fuuushh shhuuuuusshh!</em></p>\n<p>Before even everyone noticed what happened, the mana Bhela channeled melted the flying arrows, within a span of milliseconds, turning them into dangerous magic projectiles of four elemental natures--fire, water, wind and lightning.</p>\n<p>Mila was confident before. She knew a trick against an Archer, but here she was dumbfounded by magic arrows coming to blast her way. She thought she was fighting an Archer, but got up against a Mage instead. This wasn’t what she signed up for.</p>\n<p><em>Clank!</em></p>\n<p>The first blue arrow dissapeared almost the moment it reached Mila. The sound of metallic clash that followed the said arrow resounded three more times, and the three arrows left behind too disappeared almost immediately. Mila, thought she ought to dodge the magic arrows, leap a step backward, but her hasty movement combined with the slippery mud made her slipped her foothold, accidentally fell to her butt instead.</p>\n<p>Bhela aimed down her bow. Everyone was staring at her with complicated and questioning gaze, as an Archer who could do magic, this was the first time everyone witnessed it.</p>\n<p>“It’s a four elemental affinity spell!” someone’s voice roared through the silenced venue, “I heard it, I doubted it, but she really did it!”</p>\n<p>Everyone looked at his way, the man who shouted, and saw that it was the middle-aged man whom Bhela invited from outside the village. He sat eating steamed peanuts then, now he was standing perplexed.</p>\n<p>Bhela, realizing that the man was the center of the attention, and bow to him from afar.</p>\n<p>“She really did it…” the man said under his breath.</p>\n<p>Someone who sat beside him said, “Sure she did, the only one right now--I guess now that you big brain from Elemental Stone School witnessed it I guess you can die without regret?”</p>\n<p>The man looked at the woman who accompanied him, he said still with expression of disbelieve, “It’s a four elemental affinity spell…”</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, you already said that.”</p>\n<p>The last and the most famous multi elemental Unique Class was, a mage with three elemental affinity skills, died of old age--was actually the headmaster of Elemental Stone School from seventy years ago. As a scholar and a mage researching deeply in topics of elemental mana all of his career, how could he didn’t know the value of a Unique Class who surpassed even the ex-headmaster of his school?</p>\n<p>“I can’t believe someone without a Mage Unique Class really did it…”</p>\n<p>“The most promising talent of this generation, alright, the first time I witnessed an Archer could do magic,” the woman said. “Good thing she stopped her arrows then--if not, the other girl would ended up so pitiful.”</p>\n<p>As the woman said that, someone else blurted not far away from there.</p>\n<p>“She didn’t stop it.”</p>\n<p>“Pardon? Sir Kurusiya?” the woman asked.</p>\n<p>The one she was talking to was the quiet man with sharp aura. He said as a matter of fact like tone, “She didn’t stop it. Someone else did,” he sipped his tea, and when the woman still confused, he explained with hoarse voice, “those are magic, but they were still arrows shot from a bow. You can’t stop flying arrows. That girl calculated and slightly missed her aim as to not hurting her opponent. But she didn’t plan to stop it.”</p>\n<p>The woman questioned him, “If she wasn’t the one who stopped it, then would you know why the arrows disappears?”</p>\n<p>The man put down his glass of tea. “I don’t know. Why you ask me? Ask that fool there who’s been grinning all the time.”</p>\n<p>The woman, along with the middle-aged man from Stone Elemental School, looked up to the bearded foreigner.</p>\n<p>“She’s not the one who stopped it,” the bearded man said with a smile.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Mila, who mellowed from her defeat and still sat on the muddy ground, gulped as she saw her cousin come to pick her up.</p>\n<p>“I lost,” she said to Shira.</p>\n<p>“No you didn’t, that girl is the one who put down her bow first, and you still got your swords in your hands--so technically you’d win.”</p>\n<p>“I fell to my butt, I was humiliated,” Mila said, her voice trembled, “I lost….”</p>\n<p>Shira sighed. He grabbed Mila’s hand and pulled her up. “It’s adult problems from hereon, Uncle Shuro would likely summon my father back. For now, let’s get out of here,” he said.</p>\n<p>Monkey and Snake, along with the nervous Romana, came to follow them from behind to shield them from people’s laughter. Mila was so humiliated the usually feisty tomboy was so down she couldn’t afford to hold her head straight. As Shira witnessed how pitiful his cousin was, regret overwhelming him when he remembered how he was holding back from taking action himself.</p>\n<p>“Brat,” someone called him.</p>\n<p>Shira turned his head. It was Good-Natured Spirit.</p>\n<p>“You owe me this time,” the Nalaq said.</p>\n<p>Shira nodded.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>“Hear ye hear ye people! Gather around and hear me announce something incredible, people! Gather around, will ya!”</p>\n<p>Standing on top of a table, Elder Jhamil shouted to gather people, announcing something that the Young Master of Blackwood Family passed him beforehands. “Although winner of the duel is Young Lady Bhela, Young Master Frane of Blackwood House is concerned by some stupid unruly girl of the supposed biggest family in Badril Village behavior would smear my young lady--”</p>\n<p>“Big news! Big news!” someone else’s shouting cut off Elder Jhamil’s announcement, “Young Master Bonithon is running around beating people! Watch your mouth if you don’t want get beaten for no reason!”</p>\n<p>“Bony is going crazy! He’s going to kick people’s asses! Nobody knows why!”</p>\n<p>“What the fuck is going on! Why Elzhier Family messing with us Malikhs now?”</p>\n<p>At the chaotic scene before him, Elder Jhamil’s face showed a frown and a hint of hesitation. He then cleared his phlegm anyway, trying to get people’s attention, then pushed on announcing carefully, “Young Master Frane Blackwood is concerned that--”</p>\n<p>“Elder Jhamil!!” a servant came running with a horrified expression, “Bony is coming for you, run away!”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil pointed his finger at the servant and roared, “What is that brat from Elzhier Family wants to do with me! Go kick him out, I’m trying to tell everybody something important here!”</p>\n<p>“But he doesn’t listen to reasons! He’s going to punch your face, is what he said just now!”</p>\n<p>“Imbecile! Do you think a young master would jump around like a monkey and punch an elder of another family in the damn face?! He’s making ruckus. Go on, kick him out!”</p>\n<p>Looking at the crowd from the rushedly made stage, he then smiled and continued, “Right, everybody, it’s Young Master of Blackwood Family; what I’m saying is that since Young Lady Bhela Malikh is winning with ease against the foolish young lady of <em>that</em> family, Young Master Blackwood concerned that some people would shrug my young lady’s victory. So he proposed, in order to make it clear the disparity between Malikh and--sheesh--Yashura, he proposed that him as a friendly representative of Malikh Family and Shira Yashura as the repre--”</p>\n<p>“Elder Jhamil--watch out!”</p>\n<p>He had it taking from lowly servants who cut off his announcement. Fuming in anger, Elder Jhamil pointed his finger toward the one who was spriting toward him and roared, “How many times I told you to just kick him out! Shut your trap and go kick the damned brat!”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was losing his cool. But what he failed to realize in time was that the one who sprinted toward him wasn’t a servant from his family. It was not the one who telling him to run away. And before he knew it, someone leaped up on the table where he was standing and delivered a punch to the face.</p>\n<p>“Gaaahhh!”</p>\n<p>Even after Elder Jhamil stumbled down the table he stood on, his assaulter didn’t plan to let him go. And what came after that was a torrent of hardened fist, pummeling his face even though he screamed for mercy. Only when the chaotic crowd succeeded in saving him did Elder Jhamil see the assaulter’s face--it was indeed the Young Master from Elzhier Family.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Bonithon… what did you… why did you do this… for what reason?!” Elder Jhamil choked out his grievance.</p>\n<p>Bony, the man who beat the bald elder black and blue, replied with nothing but a cold stare. Instead, it was an almost incoherent voice of Pilek who answered instead.</p>\n<p>“Kekekek, don’t be angry Elder Baldy! We just discussed how you were a splendid Pugilist a long time ago, so Boss Bony came here to find out whether it was true or not! That’s why he asked you to a barehand duel!” Pilek came in with a swagger and a bottle of booze in his hand. From a single glance anybody could tell he was drunk.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s lips trembled. What duel? That brat just leaped out of nowhere without saying anything, then immediately beating him black and blue!</p>\n<p>The only one from the three delinquents who hadn’t had the smell of liquor from his body was Polio. He wore an apologetic smile, and with a slight sigh, he said, “Please forgive them, dear kind Malikh sirs, my friends are terrible when they are drunk.”</p>\n<p>Polio made a round to apologize to any Malikhs he saw. But the Malikh Family didn’t appreciate his gesture, receiving jeerings in return.</p>\n<p>Polio was a patient young man, but Pilek wasn’t. The drunk Pilek didn’t take their attitude kindly, randomly walking to a servant, said, “Hah? What the fuck are you staring me at, you no-name Malikh servant? Wanna die, eh? Huuuraah!!!”</p>\n<p><em>Shatter!</em></p>\n<p>Without a warning he swung the booze in his hand to a Malikh family servant. The man he attacked stumbled backward holding his bloodied head from the crash Pilek gave him.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Bhela Malikh had just settled greeting four foreign guests that she invited from outside, and was on her way to fetch cuisines from the kitchen to humor her guests, then she witnessed the chaotic brawl unfold with a crowdful of cheers and jeers mixed in between. Perhaps there were more than a dozen men involved, with the Malikhs servants, guards, common family members even an elder came along to surround Bony and his two underlings.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela…” a little maidservant with a crest of Elzhier Family in her uniform bowed to Bhela politely.</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at her. She returned the bow even though the other party clearly was a servant. “Miss Elzhier,” she spoke softly.</p>\n<p>“No need to be polite to this servant, Young Lady.”</p>\n<p>“I can’t be impolite to Sister Ryntia’s friends.”</p>\n<p>The Elzhier Family maidservant smiled. Since Bhela insisted, then she wouldn’t be bowing her head anymore.</p>\n<p>She said, “Eldest Young Lady sends me to ask for your forgiveness for her brother’s brashness, Young Lady Bhela.”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at the brawl that started in her family’s courtyard. This chaos would spell imperfect on tonight's Malikh Family’s Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>“There’s no need for that. Since I accepted Young Lady Mila Yashura’s duel then I somewhat anticipated Young Master Bonithon will follow suit to make trouble tonight. If anything, it is I the one who should apologize to Sister Ryntia because I couldn’t handle the situation well. Please tell her that I’ll try to maintain friendship between Malikh and Elzhier Family.”</p>\n<p>Still with the serene smile on her face, the Elzhier Family maidservant studied the expression on Bhela’s face. She spoke a moment after, “Then I’ll let Eldest Young Lady Elzhier knows by tomorrow.”</p>\n<p>“Thanks,” Bhela offered her gratitude with a bow.</p>\n<p>By this time, the brawl became anything but intensified, as men either from Elzhier Family or thugs that previously had dealings with Bony’s group came in to reinforce the Elzhier young master. Before the Malikhs could pressure the intruders with numbers, but then the completely overwhelmed by the new reinforcement.</p>\n<p>“Huurraaahh!” Pilek sent a Malikh man flying with his kick. “Where the fuck your previous cocky taunt? Cat got your tongue, eh?”</p>\n<p>The only unspoken rules in brawls were strictly no usage of mana and spell as well as no sharp objects to use as weapons. But when it was chaotic and nobody could watch everybody the sharpest mind with tricks the one who prevailed--this is why the likes of Pilek and his friend Polio who always struck in place people wouldn’t be willing the one who were taking the advantage in brawls. Even hunters and seasoned guards were no match against these naughty brats.</p>\n<p>For example, when Pilek’s punch was blocked by Elder Jhamil’s son, “You shitty brat, just wait till I deal with your father--kuukgghh!”</p>\n<p>And because no one was watching, Pilek used his knee to strike the cocky young elder in the balls.</p>\n<p>With a sad whimper from his trembling lips, Elder Jhamil’s son curled onto the ground holding his precious balls that Polio struck.</p>\n<p>Seeing that a family elder was mercilessly defeated, a few Malikhs came to avenge their young elder. By then, Pilek already had Polio watching over his back.</p>\n<p>At that point, no Malikhs could match them in hand-in-hand brawl.</p>\n<p>A stranger then casually walked in. Pilek stopped, looking at him, and amidst the chaotic scene it took a while for him to find out that the man was actually a foreigner--an eastern Kaya man. The man had a sheathed sword on his hips. But Pilek wasn’t afraid as long as he stick with the brawl rules to use only fighting unarmed.</p>\n<p>“Huurraaah!”</p>\n<p>Pilek threw a feint. Most simple Malikhs would fall for this. But the eastern Kaya man didn’t budge. Seemed to even anticipate it. With a movement too fast for Pilek to follow the man grabbed his wrist, flicked him and sent him into the air like it was nothing.</p>\n<p>It was only after Pilek rolled in the mud he realized what had happened.</p>\n<p>The man then glanced aside and walked toward Polio who in his own right was too engrossed with the brawl. With his left hand pushing Polio’s shoulder and the other hand grabbing his wrist, he flipped Polio just like he did Pilek beforehand.</p>\n<p>Pilek and a few others that the man previously flipped were amazed by how effortlessly the man disabling enthusiastic young men from fighting.</p>\n<p>The sword handle the man had was wrapped with cloth and its body too thin for regular blades. Those who noticed this would understand that the man wasn’t an ordinary Kaya. Polio was one of them.</p>\n<p>“A Samurai!” he exclaimed a moment after he got thrown onto the muddy ground.</p>\n<p>The Kaya man stopped, looking at him, then spoke with a displeased tone, “I am but a masterless ronin.”</p>\n<p>The man then continued walking toward a different direction.</p>\n<p>Bony was fighting with three men alone, so he couldn’t afford to look around. He didn’t realize the Kaya man at first, but when the man tried to grab the wild young master’s wrist, Bony reacted--he reacted by throwing a punch to the man’s face.</p>\n<p>The man slapped his flying fist from the side, tremendously muffled its momentum. Again, he tried to grab Bony’s wrist and his shoulder. Bony tried resisting but the man’s speed was too fast for him to compete.</p>\n<p>As the man prepared to flip him, Bony felt a faint gush of the wind from his legs. It didn’t take him a second to realize the man just putting his hand on his shoulder as a feint--his real target was to gently nudge his foot on rooting from the ground, which, if he’d focus his effort to get his shoulder free from the man’s grasp, a small window of opening that could be used by his opponent to disrupt his sense of balance. Thus Bony firmly stomped his feet to the ground instead. He grabbed the man’s sleeve to make his opponent not be able to easily throw like Pilek and Polio.</p>\n<p>Responding to Bony’s choice, the man curled the corner of his lips. Bony caught a hint of taunt when he staring the man in the eyes.</p>\n<p>“Kkuuuggghh!”</p>\n<p>Bony did succeed in preventing himself get flipped to the ground. But he got struck in the gut instead.</p>\n<p>The man didn’t let him go. The moment Bony stepping backward due to shock having stricken, the man was charging and got his wrist in the blink of the eyes--what happened afterward was Bony got his feet swept and he completely lost his ground, and got cheered by his friends as the last man who got thrown into the mud.</p>\n<p>Bony then sat there looking as the fight stopped; since someone took him down, more and less the Malikhs had won the brawl.</p>\n<p>“Aren’t you Thoqek’s son?” the Kaya man asked Bony.</p>\n<p>Bony wasn’t willing to open his mouth when his father’s name got mentioned.</p>\n<p>Receiving no answer, the man thus carelessly said, “Unexpectedly, you’ve got more guts than your father. Get up now, and stop making trouble in Ghalim Malikh’s home.”</p>\n<p>The young ruffians with Bony as the leader naturally wouldn’t be arrogant anymore since they had been defeated. They retreated calmly, and the Malikhs didn’t dare taunt them the second time in case Bony would change his mind and started on a rampage again. In the end, the real reason why Bony came targeting Malikh Family, as many people knew, was that he wasn’t a drinker that would lose reason to punch another family’s elder in the face.</p>\n<p>Speaking about an elder who got a punch in the face; after Bony and others were gone, Elder Jhamil showed his nose out of his hiding place. He gritted his teeth. He swore he’d use his full resource to get back from Bony’s father in the next village council meeting.</p>\n<p>“Elder Jhamil, you still haven’t announced the thing I ask you to do,” from behind, the sullen young noble Frane Blackwood said to him.</p>\n<p>“Y-young Master Blackwood, please spare me--the mood isn’t that good to draw people’s attention after that kid crashing our Ngajen Ceremony just now. How about I brief it to other village leaders tomorrow in the village council meeting?”</p>\n<p>“No, I want everyone to know it by tonight. This is the right time and the right place to announce it. Besides, I want to see what kind of a young man the one who’s supposed to be my rival.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil didn’t want to show his beaten face to the crowd tonight. But as much as he love his face he knew flattery wouldn’t get him out of this situation--at least not if he didn’t want to offend the young noble. And so with a heavy face he climbed the table once again, hiding off his reluctancy.</p>\n<p>Someone heartily made a joke on him, “Elder Jhamil, we thought you’re a man who care about face the most--I don’t expect you to boldly show how handsome you’ve become now!”</p>\n<p>“Kids nowadays getting big headed by their privileges as young masters--naturally I’ll let their fathers know how to discipline their brats!” Elder Jhamil coldly said. “Anyway, you all know that my Young Lady Bhela is a girl with talent and her future is boundless. Here in Malikh Family we’re not willing to throw our princess to cow’s dunk that is Yashura Family’s trash young master. And our friend Young Noble Frane Blackwood also thinks the same!”</p>\n<p>Such passionate speech, naturally people were cheering in anticipation of the next spectacle they thought they were going to witness.</p>\n<p>Getting the cue from Elder Jhamil, Frane Blackwood came forward with a swagger. “I speak this as a close friend of Young Lady Bhela Malikh. Someone with the name of Shira Yashura; if you think you’re worthy of her, do you dare to prove it by having a duel with me?!”</p>\n<p>The crowd was silent. They were waiting for the reply.</p>\n<p>Frane Blackwood swept the crowd with his eyes.</p>\n<p>Someone said to him the boy he challenged was utter trash. He was amused guessing how this trash would respond to his duel challenge, especially when Bhela Malikh had just completely defeated the cheeky young lady from his family.</p>\n<p>There were already murmurs spreading. People were also curious whether Shira was going to accept or run away from it.</p>\n<p>And then…</p>\n<p>“<em>Cough, cough…</em>” someone awkwardly stepped forward with a wry smile plastered on his face. People recognized his face, which looked like a monkey, and many of them had seen him together with Shira Yashura.</p>\n<p>He was Monkey. He said, “This young noble… about your proposed duel… I’m afraid Young Master Shira Yashura can’t answer it tonight.”</p>\n<p>Frane Blackwood laughed. “Why? He’s scared? His cousin challenged Young Lady Bhela to a duel for no apparent reason; don’t tell me we can do the same to them?”</p>\n<p>“No, it’s not that.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil pointed his finger at Monkey. “We all know Shira Yashura is a trash who can’t even advance to Level 4 Novice! Young Master Frane Blackwood is kind. Tonight, he’s going to give Shira one chance to admit that he’s unworthy of Young Lady Bhela Malikh to the crowd here. He does that, and there will be no need for Young Master Frane Blackwood to embarrass him by kicking his ass!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, but he can’t give you an answer tonight,” Monkey insisted.</p>\n<p>Now it was Elder Jhamil who laughed. “He’s really scared facing Young Master Frane right now?!”</p>\n<p>“No…”</p>\n<p>“Then why?”</p>\n<p>Monkey sighed.</p>\n<p>“Because he’s already gone home!”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was furious. The whole point he had to gather people even though his face had been beaten by Bony was to call out the boy and embarrass him in public, as per the young noble request. But the said person himself already went home, so Elder Jhamil standing on top of the table was for nothing.</p>\n<p>Immediately he ordered a servant to send the message to Yashura Family, while in between, cursing the fact that he didn’t get the chance to distract the guests from discussing the previous brawl. Sure enough, not only the people were talking about Bhela Malikh’s hidden Unique Class, they were also talking about Bony, and people he beat to pulp, especially Elder Jhamil. People no longer cared to gossip about Young Lady Mila Yashura who had been sent home defeated, but they laughed at someone present who had just his misfortune like Elder Jhamil instead.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil had lost his face in the end. Literally and metaphorically.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, with a solemn expression Monkey looked at his partner Snake who was enjoying the banquet and had amused himself watching the spectacle previously.</p>\n<p>Monkey said with a whisper, “Why the hell your family doesn’t show his face when they dumping shit to Young Master and Young Lady Yashura just now?!”</p>\n<p>Snake glanced at him lazily. “I don’t know. They said they were going to diagnose Patriarch Ghalim Malikh previously.”</p>\n<p>“Can’t you just fetch your brother instead? Didn’t you put your words to assure young master before this? What if he thinks we’re people who put our words lightly?”</p>\n<p>“The one who’s diagnosing the patriarch is my grandfather, my brother supposed to be free enough to be a busybody just now,” Snake said, displeased by Monkey’s tone accusing him of being unloyal to his own word.</p>\n<p>Actually, he also confused why his brother didn’t show his nose when Young Lady Mila recklessly brought a sword to challenge Bhela to a duel. From his understanding of his brother’s character and the relationship between his family and Yashura from what he knew told him that more or less his brother was going to back Yashura if the drama with Malikh Family intensified. But he didn’t. Snake would barge into Malikh Family’s doors to look for his grandfather if he knew it was going to be like this instead.</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-1/chapter-4":"<p>Badril Village, though had been two years passed without her presence, was the same as always for Bhela Malikh. She hadn’t that many acquaintances her age she could consider friendly before. In spite of that, from the day she returned, people act as if they were her rekindled childhood friends she never knew she had.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” a daughter of an elder from Elzhier Family asked curiously, “is the rumor about that story true?”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at her with eyelids half-closed.</p>\n<p>“Which rumor?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, silly you, of course <em>that</em> rumor! The one about your romance with a blue blood noble!”</p>\n<p>Giggles of girls followed after the girl’s words. When Bhela returned to Badril Village she brought not only fame and reputation, but interesting stories and rumors as well. She was currently surrounded by curious young ladies who sought for exciting gossip.</p>\n<p>“Yeah, yeah!” another girl excitedly hussing in low voice. “I heard he’ll attend Malikh’s ngajen ceremony tonight!”</p>\n<p>“Really?”</p>\n<p>“Why else would Young Lady Bhela take the Chef Chief position if she didn’t expect for her lover to come tonight? He’ll come for sure!”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, yeah, everybody is saying Young Lady Bhela doing just for that!”</p>\n<p>Bhela found it was amazing how people could conjure their own rumors despite not seeing the true story by their own eyes.</p>\n<p>And just when the young ladies started getting excited discussing Young Lady Bhela’s ‘love life’, a vigorous shout resounded the courtyard announcing that Blackwood Family had arrived.</p>\n<p>“Blackwood Family?” someone cocked their head and looked over the direction of the gate. “What kind of family is so bold announcing their names in other family’s ngajen ceremony? Not even Village Head’s Elzhier Family would do to the ceremony host!”</p>\n<p>“Only foreigners to be that stupid to be rude in big family like Malikh! If this is my place I’d send a guard to kick their ass out as soon as possible!”</p>\n<p>“Look over there! Malikh Family elders are rushing to the gate! Let’s check out how’s Malikhs going to deal with it!”</p>\n<p>Curious guests were tailing the elders to see some commotion they thought would occur. However, not only did the Malikhs not make a fuss over it, they even bowed their heads toward the newly arrived noble as if they were servants greeting their returning master. Young people were overly excited because nobles were foreign and appeared in stories all of their lives.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Mila, who already went back with her friend, was gritting teeth with anger. Beside her Romana was holding the tomboy back, though concerned she didn't say a word.</p>\n<p>“Why should I am the one who always had to hold myself back?” Mila hissed in a low voice as if she was wronged.</p>\n<p>“Look around and think about who’s receiving the blow the most. Everyone’s talking about your cousin right now--do you want to make it worse for him?”</p>\n<p>After hearing her friend’s warning, Mila began to take a deep breath and think things through. Romana was right. When she opened her ears Mila could hear people comparing the young master of this noble Blackwood Family with her cousin Shira. They compared such a gallant-looking young noble with a trash of Yashura Family young master, adding with their own biased seasoning here and there, making her cousin Shira look really bad. Mila trembled as her face boiled red from holding back her anger.</p>\n<p>“Where’s Shira right now?”</p>\n<p>“I think he went hiding!” Romana said.</p>\n<p>“Hiding?! He’s embarrassed to show his face that much?”</p>\n<p>After circling around a bit, Mila found the boy’s silhouette in the shadow far from the braziers' light. There, he was squatting, hiding along with two other silhouettes who were also squatting in a suspicious manner.</p>\n<p>“Now, young master, where the hell did you get this coin?” someone whispered from the suspicious bunch.</p>\n<p>The reply came also in the same hushed manner. “Don’t ask me now, just know I’ve got a few more hidden in my house. I can’t move my family, but if you’re fine with this, I can invest in your goods earlier.”</p>\n<p>“We’re fine? Of course we’re fine! Don’t you know how amazing this coin is?”</p>\n<p>“It’s amazing? I can’t even buy satays with this. Nobody here would receive unfamiliar currency.”</p>\n<p>“But don’t you know how far ahead you can go if merchants know you grab some of these coins?”</p>\n<p>“You tell me.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, these coins weren’t issued by any countries, but they’re valuable. Lots of herbs and ingredients in the black markets can only be bought with these coins...”</p>\n<p><em>...whisper whisper whisper...</em></p>\n<p>Mila approached.</p>\n<p>“Ey, what are you doing?!”</p>\n<p>For some reasons, Shira and Monkey, one of his companions, almost jumped in fright by her barking. Both Mila and Romana behind her saw Shira and Monkey were acting suspicious--but Sneak, the third silhouette, didn’t even try to hide that he was nibbling on something delicious.</p>\n<p>Mila, with a weird face, hissed, “Is that… <em>rendang</em> you guys were eating?”</p>\n<p>“<em>Cough, cough,</em>” hiding the opened wrapping banana leaves, Shira awkwardly trying to make an excuse, “I think Malikh Family is too eager to cut off relationships with our Yashura Family so… I reckon they don’t need this anymore…”</p>\n<p>Mila was so angry she slapped the banana leaves in Shira’s hand.</p>\n<p>“Ah, my rendang…”</p>\n<p>“Your rendang?! You goddamn moron!” Mila hissed, she didn’t dare to roar and announce themselves to other guests. “You’re about to get cuckolded and all you think about is a goddamn rendang?!”</p>\n<p>“Young master, someone trying to get you cuckolded?” licking his fingers for some leftover rendang sauce, Snake asked from the side.</p>\n<p>Shira shook his head. “Cuckold is a very strong word. That girl didn’t even consider me from the beginning. It’s not like we're a married couple yet.”</p>\n<p>He then came to pick the spoiled beef and mourned, “ah… my poor rendang.”</p>\n<p>“Stop crying over that shit! It’s not important!”</p>\n<p>Monkey blurted, “Rendang is not important?”</p>\n<p>Mila glared at Monkey. The monkey-faced peddler closed his mouth as soon as he opened it.</p>\n<p>Romana saw her friend Mila had a bad affinity with her cousin whenever she was angry, thus came to explain from the side, “Young Master Shira, don’t you know people outside the Mossack culture do take engagement seriously? It’s understandable for a young heir of a conservative family like Yashura to not care much about it--but, whatever your feelings regarding your engagement is, if Young Lady Bhela has an affair outside, she’ll also drag down Yashura Family’s reputation. So please be mindful about it more for the sake of your family.”</p>\n<p>They didn’t really think about this deeply since straightforward Mossack people were the type to have children before they were even married. If things went awry, Shira reckoned his uncle and the elders in his family might think the engagement matter was similar to puppy love, about children bantering, but the young generation who was exposed to stories and gossips from books and travellers might think about it differently. And someone who didn’t hang out so much like Shira wouldn’t be able to tell how these youngsters would talk about this incident in the future.</p>\n<p>So Shira stood up and patted his trouser, admitted, “Ah, you’re right, Romana.”</p>\n<p>Mila crossed her arms. Frowning at her cousin. “What are you gonna do now? Fight them? No need to be afraid, I’m with you.”</p>\n<p>Snake, still squatting comfortably, added, “Young Master, my grandfather and my older brother are still here too. You won’t be at a disadvantage in case things go downhill.”</p>\n<p>“It’s decided. Let’s kick their asses!” Mila growled.</p>\n<p>“The heck are you talking about kicking people’s asses in Ngajen Ceremony?” Shira grunted.</p>\n<p>“Then at least let me slap that slut’s arrogant face!”</p>\n<p>Shira shook his head.</p>\n<p>“Let’s go,” he said.</p>\n<p>“We’re gonna slap her face now?” Mila asked.</p>\n<p>“No. We at least have to make Family Yashura’s presence known here,” Shira said. He caught his companions’ confused expressions, so he added, “Everyone is getting excited because most of them are young'uns. But if this incident gets out of the hands, the elders from other families won’t be silent about it.”</p>\n<p>Mila wanted to say something but didn’t after seeing Shira’s relaxed face. She didn’t want to say something silly that’d change the boy’s mind. Therefore, with Shira leading the way, she and her friend Romana went to see the ruckus caused by the noble’s arrival. Leaving Monkey and Sneak who were silent looking at their back.</p>\n<p>The two exchanged glances.</p>\n<p>They looked down, eyes sweeping the ground.</p>\n<p>“Mm?” Monkey mumbled, his hands crawling all over the dirt.</p>\n<p>Snake took out a magic wand. The wand shimmered with a gentle light, then he used that to give some light to the ground where the rendang was spoiled.</p>\n<p>But it was Monkey who shouted in joy, “I got one!”</p>\n<p>“Give me that!” Snake pounced the moment he saw Monkey rubbed the dirt of a piece of rendang.</p>\n<p>Pushing out Snake’s face from grabbing the rendang in his hand, Monkey felt wronged and cried, “Why would a rich gentleman like you fight over a single beef with this poor peddler? Don’t you know my family can only afford to eat beef once a year?”</p>\n<p>“Why, you asked?” Snake sneered, “There’s no need to say the obvious. You don’t get to eat Patriarch Shuro’s handmade rendang everyday! And I’m saying this after starving for beef ever since I’m following you.”</p>\n<p>“Fuck off!”</p>\n<p>“Give me that!”</p>\n<p>“No!”</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the shadowy corner where they were wrestling came to be lightened up with a lit torch.</p>\n<p>“Ehem, you two gentlemen,” a voice called.</p>\n<p>For a moment, Monkey and Snake stopped fighting.</p>\n<p>The voice owner was a man with Malikh Family’s servant uniform. Reluctantly, he continued, “Badril Village locals are usually open-minded and tolerant people. However, we have a bottom line. If you two couldn’t hold it you should rent some inn room or do it in the bushes! Don’t do it in the open, you’re making people uncomfortable! Know some shame!”</p>\n<p>Monkey at first didn’t get what the servant was talking about. Then he realized during infighting over the rendang, he had opened his legs, and Snake was on top of him in a very, very awkward manner.</p>\n<p>“Dammit!” he kicked Snake and trembling over the horror he caught himself in. But suddenly he noticed the rendang in his hand already vanished. He whirled his head around. Snake was already licking his fingers with a satisfied face.</p>\n<p>“Dammit!” Monkey howled again.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The one who enthusiastically greeted the young noble of Blackwood Family was Elder Jhamil instead of Bhela Malikh. He managed to conjure thirty years worth of bullshitting skills to flatter and fawn over the other party, rather thick faced to continue despite the young master of noble family rolled his eyes several times. As soon as the young noble caught the sight of a short-haired girl he immediately escaped from Elder Jhamil’s clutch with a big grin on his face.</p>\n<p>“Ah, Sister Bhela!”</p>\n<p>“Young Master Frane Blackwood.”</p>\n<p>“How are you doing Young Lady Bhela? Fancy to meet you again,” he said as he gifted the girl a flower.</p>\n<p>Bhela received the flower but then immediately passed it to a random maidservant beside her. She said as if it was nothing, “I’m fine. Thank you.”</p>\n<p>Young Master Frane Blackwood smiled wryly. “I’ve been travelling with hardly any rest so that I can see you sooner, my young lady,” the young master of Blackwood Family, Frane Blackwood, said, “may I be so lucky to receive your company tonight?”</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry, but here the words ‘tonight’s companion’ have different meanings than when you say it in the western-style ball--so, no, Young Master Blackwood, I can’t give you company tonight,” she said.</p>\n<p>The young noble still had a smile and wanted to correct his wording, but Bhela suddenly raised her hand and said, “Excuse me.”</p>\n<p>She went past him and greeted another pair of guests instead.</p>\n<p>“Greeting, sir, madam.”</p>\n<p>“It’s about time,” the middle-aged man didn’t answer Bhela’s greeting, but complained instead. “You know the other families had begun their ceremonies, right? Even though we don’t have the same ceremony as your Ngajen Ceremony from the place where I come from, but I know those who don’t take any old ceremonies seriously only brought bad luck over their lands.”</p>\n<p>There was a rare restraint in Bhela’s voice as she replied, “I apologize for our bad conduct, Sir Instructor. I will request the elders to proceed with the ceremony. Please let me lead you toward the reserved spot I previously prepared for both of you.”</p>\n<p>“Lead the way then.”</p>\n<p>Badril Village locals witnessed the valiant Young Lady of Malikh Family taking charge of the Ngajen Ceremony as the Chief Chef, but with the appearance of her bowing to two unfamiliar guests as well, whispers were floating amongst the Ngajen Ceremony guests. Before long, everyone knew that two guests Bhela Malikh greeted were the ones she personally invited, but was neglected before the family’s gate because of the excitement made by the noble’s arrival. Bhela came to them to apologize in person.</p>\n<p>Young Master Frane Blackwood, who felt ignored, pulled a self-decrepitating sneer. He complained to Elder Jhamil instead, “Oh, Malikh Family elder, can you tell me the identity of those two guests who made even Young Lady Bhela to bow her head?”</p>\n<p>“Ehem, ehem,” Elder Jhamil didn’t know what to answer, so he concocted a reply out of thin air, “I think they were relatives from her maternal family.”</p>\n<p>“Is that so? From the way they are dressed, they don’t look from that respectable background enough to get the young lady’s full attention. Don’t you think so?”</p>\n<p>“Young noble is right. Young Lady Bhela’s father once was a gangster thus he didn’t manage to teach common sense to the young lady. I’ll talk to her later to explain what’s really important.”</p>\n<p>After a bit of excuse and fawning, Young Master Blackwood felt this Elder Jhamil was acceptable. He told the Blackwood Family’s servants to bring the gifts he had prepared, which were naturally accepted by Elder Jhamil on the young lady’s behalf. In the meantime, people were disappointed that the drama they were expecting didn’t happen. But what could they do besides shaking their heads and disperse?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Year after year, the ngajen ceremony evolved from stiff sessions of praying ceremony for village safety to the new stylish festivities of foods and happy times for the youngsters, where fads and trends emerge. However big their way of life was changing the conservative major families, Yashura and Elzhier, still pretty much followed the old ways, especially when it came to the prayers. Only Malikh Family amongst the three that eager to embrace the new world that was coming. And by Elder Jhamil’s direction, instead of local shamans, Malikh Family asked help from foreign priests from western orthodox temples from nearby villages to lead the prayer.</p>\n<p>It was all good if one made a progressive decision with the greater good in mind. But here was the problem; orthodox temple priests usually led prayers for abundant harvest, while Ngajen Ceremony was all about calming Selaqs from descending the mountain. These priests probably hadn’t any clue how Selaqs looked like.</p>\n<p>“It was inappropriate for a noble to pray to old Mossack deities they don’t believe in, that was Malikhs’ excuses,'' Mila complained non-stop since they finished praying with other guests. In her hands--like a young mother hugging her baby--were plates of food she had just plundered from Malikh Family’s banquet tables prepared to entertain guests.</p>\n<p>“What deity? Wasn’t the mantra replaced from ancient Mossack prayers to magic spell mantra to calm down Selaq since… I don’t know, fifty years ago?” Romana said. The food in her hands was no less than Mila’s. These two girls seemed to think Malikh Family would regret offending them if they plunder the latter’s prepared feast like no tomorrow.</p>\n<p>“That's what I was saying! We no longer those ancient Mossacks who would sacrifice relatives so Selaqs won’t come down the mountain! Nowadays we’ve been using legit spells to keep all those Selaqs away, and these stupid Malikhs want to change the tradition just to appease some visiting noble? They’d rather avoid their noble guest to be uncomfortable than preventing Selaqs from coming down to chew their stupid brains, hah!”</p>\n<p>Compared to noisy girls beside him, Shira was able to keep his head to his feet. Romana signaled Mila with her eyes when she realized the boy wasn’t so into retaliating against the Malikhs; instead of invading the feast Shira, grabbed Malikh Family’s snacks moderately whenever he could--just like any other normal guests that came here.</p>\n<p>Mila grumbled with a bad mood, faced Shira and said, “Don’t you have something you need to do?”</p>\n<p>“Like what?” Shira hoped this cheeky cousin of his wouldn’t say something about kicking people’s asses again.</p>\n<p>“We can’t wait for something to happen,” she said. “Go ask that bitc--I mean, that fiancée of yours--go ask for a dance. The young’uns are starting to get heated. Look there, one of them couples are dancing. You go join them since that short-haired cunt is your fiancée after all.”</p>\n<p>Mila glanced around for a while before she realized she just had her tongue slipped. She quickly corrected her previous words, “Did I say cunt? I mean short-haired bitch--no, short-haired <em>young lady</em>.”</p>\n<p>“Why don’t you just be honest with yourself here. People have been calling Malikhs much worse here because the foreign priests matter!” Romana laughed.</p>\n<p>At that moment a very young maidservant of Malikh Family just passed by and overheard their conversation. The little maidservant snorted in anger, which made Mila snorted back as a retort.</p>\n<p>“Go, go! Go dance with her!” Mila whispered when she was sure only Shira and Romana were around.</p>\n<p>Shira clicked his tongue. “I don’t even have a single proper conversation with her these past ten years. Why should I go ask her dance out of the blue? Just showing our face around here is enough.”</p>\n<p>“Fool! If she accepted to dance with you then all is good, that would only confirm Malikh Family’s cocky attitude is only because their dipshit brains are getting fried by their own inflated proud ego, nothing serious! But if she ignores you in front of others… heh--she dares!”</p>\n<p>“That’s easy for you to say. If someone you don’t like suddenly asks your hands for a dance, what would you feel later on when you found out refusing means two families become enemies?”</p>\n<p>“Uh-uh, I don’t feel nothing. If he’s my fiancé then it’s my job to go my way out to make it clear in public! Going dancing, going kissing, like a proper damned couple! That’s what the goddamn engagement is all about! Right?”</p>\n<p>Mila ate a cookie and she blinked. Unsure of the previous words she said, she glanced at Romana and murmured, “...right?”</p>\n<p>Romana shrugged.</p>\n<p>But Shira wouldn’t back down easily. He continued arguing, “What if your fiancé is Bony Elzhier, then? Are you going to kiss him to prove he’s your fiancé?”</p>\n<p>Mila hid her gasp.</p>\n<p>“You wanna die?” she pursed her lips. “Listen to me or I’m gonna smack your face!”</p>\n<p>Shira groaned against his cousin’s unreasonableness. But before he could concoct a satisfying retort, Snake and Monkey came out of nowhere.</p>\n<p>“Oh, Young Master Shira,” Monkey came patting him on the shoulder, “it seems you get cuckolded for real this time.”</p>\n<p>People were clapping and whistling as the flashy Young Master Frane Blackwood led Young Lady Bhela Malikh by the hand.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Malikh was entertaining two guests previously, but that bald elder raised a fuss about how she neglected the young noble, so in the end it came to this.”</p>\n<p>Monkey laughed as he teased Shira with his elbow, “They’re going to dance. When two people were dancing in Ngajen Ceremony, that meant they--” he caught the scary experssion on Mila’s face, stopped, “nevermind…”</p>\n<p>“That slut!” Mila hissed.</p>\n<p>This was getting serious. Whenever Mila showed that kind of face something bad would happen. Again, the moment Shira opened his mouth to say something, someone else came to grab him in the shoulder.</p>\n<p>“Brat, your woman is going to cuckold you in public,” said the newcomer, Good-Natured Spirit, who literally came out of the thin air.</p>\n<p>“You too?”</p>\n<p>Shira had a headache. Both Monkey and Snake couldn’t see the annoying Good-Natured Spirit, but the three of them were in harmony in mocking him. They mocked him to the point saying he wouldn’t care would only embarrass him further.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, being led by the hand, Bhela Malikh asked Young Master Blackwood, “What kind of remedy Blackwood Family brought with you?”</p>\n<p>“Why so much in hurry, my young lady?” the young noble gave a laugh and a flash of smile. “No need to worry, Blackwood Family sympathize with the disaster that befell your father, so my mother send me here to personally deliver the medicine Blackwood House had sought far and wide.”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh said nothing more. The Young Master of Blackwood Family pondered as he read the cold expression of the girl, thinking that even with flowers and jewelry gifts, nothing could move this young lady. Such a waste of that beautiful face to not letting a single smile escaped, Young Master Blackwood could only smacked his lips and shook his head. But as soon as he mentioned a medicine he brought for her father, the feisty young lady became amiable almost immediately.</p>\n<p>Good thing for him. Bhela Malikh was talented, the Blackwood Family planned to have her inside their house, and if things went this smoothly he could do that his mother told him sooner than he expected.</p>\n<p>“Little bitch of Malikh Family,” a girl roared, “you finally show your true color you bitch! Is Yashura Family a joke to you?!”</p>\n<p>The furious Mila Yashura became the center of attention. She snorted as she strode, like an angry bull preparing to charge, with the mood that would make the crowd wordlessly give way to her. Not only because they didn’t want anything to do with the infamous young lady of Yashura Family--who, when angry, once punched Bony in the face with a nosebleed--but also because she got a sword in her hands.</p>\n<p>Shira glanced down. His father’s sword he brought with him was gone. He looked again at the unsheated weapon in his cousin’s hands.</p>\n<p>He could only slap his own face the moment he noticed what was happened.</p>\n<p>Mila took a step forward slowly, but her face turned even fiercer. She spoke, “You got guts to bring a lover from outside, eh? I knew something fishy happened when I saw you cut your hair, you little slut.”</p>\n<p>“I cut my hair because it got in the way during my training,” Bhela replied plainly. “And this is not my lover. Just a relative of my friend.”</p>\n<p>“You lying little slut. As if someone like you have any friends!”</p>\n<p>“I do have a friend.” Bhela said. A rare emphasizing tone in her voice was telling that she was upset, but she held back from explaining further.</p>\n<p>“I don’t care what your excuse is! Do you think I don’t know what you shitty Malikhs up to? You already don’t put Yashura Family in your eyes, eh? Just because you bitch have a little vacation outside, eh? If you think you’re a big shot, why don’t you prove it here and now?!”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh was silent for a while. Looking at Mila, she then asked, “And what are you suggesting I should do, Young Lady Yashura?”</p>\n<p>Mila stabbed her sword into the ground.</p>\n<p>“I just want to know how awesome is this Archer class you’ve got overseas that makes you Malikhs stop putting us Yashuras in your eyes,” Mila sneered. “Why don’t we test it with my sword, eh? Let’s do a duel, bitch.”</p>\n<p>Bhela just looked at Mila strangely.</p>\n<p>“But you’re a Specialist class,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Aha! Getting scared, aren’t ya, you little cunt?”</p>\n<p>Bhela didn’t want to argue with her. So she told the nearest servant to go grab a bow.</p>\n<p>On the other side, Monkey anxiously elbowed Shira, said, “Should I drag your cousin back?”</p>\n<p>“Stand down, mister. Mila is the one who’s starting it. She can’t afford to back down now.”</p>\n<p>Beside them Snake was nodding as he understood what Shira meant.</p>\n<p>Then with a laugh, Good-Natured Spirit, who was already tired jeering him, said to Shira. “Kid, shit just got real. Ain’t that a good idea to pull her before it’s too late?”</p>\n<p>Shira wanted to but he couldn’t. He knew exactly Mila’s strength. Fighting bare hands, she might get a chance to stand against the strongest youngster in the village, but it would become a different story when weapons and mana were involved.</p>\n<p>Since Mila was the one to propose the duel, bailing out before the fight began would be slapping her own face in front of the guests. It was a bad idea, because Mila didn’t appear to have the slightest chance to win. So bad that it’d be more reasonable to just surrender. But Shira knew Mila hated to go back on her words the most. Thus he silently moved closer to her, prepared to pull her back in before the situation really got out of his hands.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Young Master Blackwood, was pulled out by an adjutant of his family.</p>\n<p>Smirking, he asked the adjutant, “Who is that girl who picking a fight with Bhela?”</p>\n<p>“Seems like the eldest young lady of that family,” the adjutant replied.</p>\n<p>“You mean the family my Bhela got engaged to?” Young Master Frane Blackwood asked as if Bhela already his. The corner of his lips curled as he thought this might be a good chance to do something on the engagement that Blackwood House already saw as a thorn in their eyes. “Do you have something on that girl?”</p>\n<p>“Replying to young master, since Yashura Family is the main obstacle for us to get Young Lady Bhela Malikh to our side, your mother has already sent someone to investigate them. The eldest young lady of Yashura Family merely a Level 10 Specialist class who just graduated from Novice about seven months ago.”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood couldn’t help but chuckle. Even though the two young ladies had the same level, a Specialist merely support class that wasn’t suited in combat. This duel affair would turn out to be a joke.</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood scoffed. “Let my Bhela teach her some manners. I don’t want anyone to disturb us after this.”</p>\n<p>“Young master,” the adjutant lowered his voice, “I don’t think that’s a good idea.”</p>\n<p>“What’s on your mind, adjutant?”</p>\n<p>“I just made a round to check the guests attending this ceremony, and I found…”--he lowered his voice--“...some spectators amongst the guests that shouldn’t have be here….”</p>\n<p>“Go on,” the young noble urged.</p>\n<p>“I just received the word, young master, there are experts that Elder Jhamil said he didn’t invite.”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood frowned. “What… what’s that supposed to mean?”</p>\n<p>On the less crowded place of the courtyard, the middle-aged man who Bhela greeted before, along with the middle-aged woman, watched the commotion unfold while nibbling on steamed peanuts. He glanced at the other place where a man calmly sipping tea, a man with a hard face who couldn’t hide his sharp aura, then swept his gaze at the one who beside him, a short stature man who wore a headband to hide his reddish hair from public, who also happened to enjoy steamed peanuts while his focus solely at one direction in the crowd.</p>\n<p>All of them came in common garments incognito. But still Elder Jhamil sent people to keep tabs on them, especially since the bald elder still didn’t know the reason Bhela Malikh invited these foreigners.</p>\n<p>The ngajen ceremony usually consisted of three main parts--prayer, socializing, and sending offerings to the mountain as the finale. It was uncommon for irrelevant events to happen between them. However, since the young lady of the host had already accepted the duel, Malikh Family set up an emergency venue for the fight.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil came to invite himself as the judge. For a change to hummiliate those simple Yashuras and to slip himself onto the spotlight, he couldn’t ask for better opportunity.</p>\n<p>“You two ready?” Elder Jhamil asked both of the opposing sides. “This is a friendly match between two friendly families. So stop before your blade hit your enemy,” he said, seemingly talking to either sides, but didn’t say anything about the arrows part.</p>\n<p>Since Bhela Malikh was an Archer, she suggested to Mila, “I’m using a bow. So you can move first. I’ll try to dodge for ten seconds.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t need that,” Mila scoffed.</p>\n<p>“Very well…” she said. She glanced at Elder Jhamil, said, “Elder Jhamil, please begin the duel.&quot;</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil counted to three.</p>\n<p>The duel began.</p>\n<p>“AAAAAA!!!” Mila roared with the sword raised above her head, charging ahead.</p>\n<p>Contrast to her opponent’s battle cry, Bhela was solemn. She picked four arrows from the quiver tied on her hips. Nocking the arrows simultaneously, she took a deep breath as she concentrated to channel different natures elemental mana from her manasphere. The mana, through fingers and her thumb, flowing into all the four arrows and soon the tip of the arrows glowed with four different colors.</p>\n<p>The wind began to stir.</p>\n<p>And she raised the bow. She released the arrows.</p>\n<p><em>Fuuush fuuuushhh fuuushh shhuuuuusshh!</em></p>\n<p>Before even everyone noticed what happened, the mana Bhela channeled melted the flying arrows, within a span of milliseconds, turning them into dangerous magic projectiles of four elemental natures--fire, water, wind and lightning.</p>\n<p>Mila was confident before. She knew a trick against an Archer, but here she was dumbfounded by magic arrows coming to blast her way. She thought she was fighting an Archer, but got up against a Mage instead. This wasn’t what she signed up for.</p>\n<p><em>Clank!</em></p>\n<p>The first blue arrow dissapeared almost the moment it reached Mila. The sound of metallic clash that followed the said arrow resounded three more times, and the three arrows left behind too disappeared almost immediately. Mila, thought she ought to dodge the magic arrows, leap a step backward, but her hasty movement combined with the slippery mud made her slipped her foothold, accidentally fell to her butt instead.</p>\n<p>Bhela aimed down her bow. Everyone was staring at her with complicated and questioning gaze, as an Archer who could do magic, this was the first time everyone witnessed it.</p>\n<p>“It’s a four elemental affinity spell!” someone’s voice roared through the silenced venue, “I heard it, I doubted it, but she really did it!”</p>\n<p>Everyone looked at his way, the man who shouted, and saw that it was the middle-aged man whom Bhela invited from outside the village. He sat eating steamed peanuts then, now he was standing perplexed.</p>\n<p>Bhela, realizing that the man was the center of the attention, and bow to him from afar.</p>\n<p>“She really did it…” the man said under his breath.</p>\n<p>Someone who sat beside him said, “Sure she did, the only one right now--I guess now that you big brain from Elemental Stone School witnessed it I guess you can die without regret?”</p>\n<p>The man looked at the woman who accompanied him, he said still with expression of disbelieve, “It’s a four elemental affinity spell…”</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, you already said that.”</p>\n<p>The last and the most famous multi elemental Unique Class was, a mage with three elemental affinity skills, died of old age--was actually the headmaster of Elemental Stone School from seventy years ago. As a scholar and a mage researching deeply in topics of elemental mana all of his career, how could he didn’t know the value of a Unique Class who surpassed even the ex-headmaster of his school?</p>\n<p>“I can’t believe someone without a Mage Unique Class really did it…”</p>\n<p>“The most promising talent of this generation, alright, the first time I witnessed an Archer could do magic,” the woman said. “Good thing she stopped her arrows then--if not, the other girl would ended up so pitiful.”</p>\n<p>As the woman said that, someone else blurted not far away from there.</p>\n<p>“She didn’t stop it.”</p>\n<p>“Pardon? Sir Kurusiya?” the woman asked.</p>\n<p>The one she was talking to was the quiet man with sharp aura. He said as a matter of fact like tone, “She didn’t stop it. Someone else did,” he sipped his tea, and when the woman still confused, he explained with hoarse voice, “those are magic, but they were still arrows shot from a bow. You can’t stop flying arrows. That girl calculated and slightly missed her aim as to not hurting her opponent. But she didn’t plan to stop it.”</p>\n<p>The woman questioned him, “If she wasn’t the one who stopped it, then would you know why the arrows disappears?”</p>\n<p>The man put down his glass of tea. “I don’t know. Why you ask me? Ask that fool there who’s been grinning all the time.”</p>\n<p>The woman, along with the middle-aged man from Stone Elemental School, looked up to the bearded foreigner.</p>\n<p>“She’s not the one who stopped it,” the bearded man said with a smile.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Mila, who mellowed from her defeat and still sat on the muddy ground, gulped as she saw her cousin come to pick her up.</p>\n<p>“I lost,” she said to Shira.</p>\n<p>“No you didn’t, that girl is the one who put down her bow first, and you still got your swords in your hands--so technically you’d win.”</p>\n<p>“I fell to my butt, I was humiliated,” Mila said, her voice trembled, “I lost….”</p>\n<p>Shira sighed. He grabbed Mila’s hand and pulled her up. “It’s adult problems from hereon, Uncle Shuro would likely summon my father back. For now, let’s get out of here,” he said.</p>\n<p>Monkey and Snake, along with the nervous Romana, came to follow them from behind to shield them from people’s laughter. Mila was so humiliated the usually feisty tomboy was so down she couldn’t afford to hold her head straight. As Shira witnessed how pitiful his cousin was, regret overwhelming him when he remembered how he was holding back from taking action himself.</p>\n<p>“Brat,” someone called him.</p>\n<p>Shira turned his head. It was Good-Natured Spirit.</p>\n<p>“You owe me this time,” the Nalaq said.</p>\n<p>Shira nodded.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>“Hear ye hear ye people! Gather around and hear me announce something incredible, people! Gather around, will ya!”</p>\n<p>Standing on top of a table, Elder Jhamil shouted to gather people, announcing something that the Young Master of Blackwood Family passed him beforehands. “Although winner of the duel is Young Lady Bhela, Young Master Frane of Blackwood House is concerned by some stupid unruly girl of the supposed biggest family in Badril Village behavior would smear my young lady--”</p>\n<p>“Big news! Big news!” someone else’s shouting cut off Elder Jhamil’s announcement, “Young Master Bonithon is running around beating people! Watch your mouth if you don’t want get beaten for no reason!”</p>\n<p>“Bony is going crazy! He’s going to kick people’s asses! Nobody knows why!”</p>\n<p>“What the fuck is going on! Why Elzhier Family messing with us Malikhs now?”</p>\n<p>At the chaotic scene before him, Elder Jhamil’s face showed a frown and a hint of hesitation. He then cleared his phlegm anyway, trying to get people’s attention, then pushed on announcing carefully, “Young Master Frane Blackwood is concerned that--”</p>\n<p>“Elder Jhamil!!” a servant came running with a horrified expression, “Bony is coming for you, run away!”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil pointed his finger at the servant and roared, “What is that brat from Elzhier Family wants to do with me! Go kick him out, I’m trying to tell everybody something important here!”</p>\n<p>“But he doesn’t listen to reasons! He’s going to punch your face, is what he said just now!”</p>\n<p>“Imbecile! Do you think a young master would jump around like a monkey and punch an elder of another family in the damn face?! He’s making ruckus. Go on, kick him out!”</p>\n<p>Looking at the crowd from the rushedly made stage, he then smiled and continued, “Right, everybody, it’s Young Master of Blackwood Family; what I’m saying is that since Young Lady Bhela Malikh is winning with ease against the foolish young lady of <em>that</em> family, Young Master Blackwood concerned that some people would shrug my young lady’s victory. So he proposed, in order to make it clear the disparity between Malikh and--sheesh--Yashura, he proposed that him as a friendly representative of Malikh Family and Shira Yashura as the repre--”</p>\n<p>“Elder Jhamil--watch out!”</p>\n<p>He had it taking from lowly servants who cut off his announcement. Fuming in anger, Elder Jhamil pointed his finger toward the one who was spriting toward him and roared, “How many times I told you to just kick him out! Shut your trap and go kick the damned brat!”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was losing his cool. But what he failed to realize in time was that the one who sprinted toward him wasn’t a servant from his family. It was not the one who telling him to run away. And before he knew it, someone leaped up on the table where he was standing and delivered a punch to the face.</p>\n<p>“Gaaahhh!”</p>\n<p>Even after Elder Jhamil stumbled down the table he stood on, his assaulter didn’t plan to let him go. And what came after that was a torrent of hardened fist, pummeling his face even though he screamed for mercy. Only when the chaotic crowd succeeded in saving him did Elder Jhamil see the assaulter’s face--it was indeed the Young Master from Elzhier Family.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Bonithon… what did you… why did you do this… for what reason?!” Elder Jhamil choked out his grievance.</p>\n<p>Bony, the man who beat the bald elder black and blue, replied with nothing but a cold stare. Instead, it was an almost incoherent voice of Pilek who answered instead.</p>\n<p>“Kekekek, don’t be angry Elder Baldy! We just discussed how you were a splendid Pugilist a long time ago, so Boss Bony came here to find out whether it was true or not! That’s why he asked you to a barehand duel!” Pilek came in with a swagger and a bottle of booze in his hand. From a single glance anybody could tell he was drunk.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s lips trembled. What duel? That brat just leaped out of nowhere without saying anything, then immediately beating him black and blue!</p>\n<p>The only one from the three delinquents who hadn’t had the smell of liquor from his body was Polio. He wore an apologetic smile, and with a slight sigh, he said, “Please forgive them, dear kind Malikh sirs, my friends are terrible when they are drunk.”</p>\n<p>Polio made a round to apologize to any Malikhs he saw. But the Malikh Family didn’t appreciate his gesture, receiving jeerings in return.</p>\n<p>Polio was a patient young man, but Pilek wasn’t. The drunk Pilek didn’t take their attitude kindly, randomly walking to a servant, said, “Hah? What the fuck are you staring me at, you no-name Malikh servant? Wanna die, eh? Huuuraah!!!”</p>\n<p><em>Shatter!</em></p>\n<p>Without a warning he swung the booze in his hand to a Malikh family servant. The man he attacked stumbled backward holding his bloodied head from the crash Pilek gave him.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Bhela Malikh had just settled greeting four foreign guests that she invited from outside, and was on her way to fetch cuisines from the kitchen to humor her guests, then she witnessed the chaotic brawl unfold with a crowdful of cheers and jeers mixed in between. Perhaps there were more than a dozen men involved, with the Malikhs servants, guards, common family members even an elder came along to surround Bony and his two underlings.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela…” a little maidservant with a crest of Elzhier Family in her uniform bowed to Bhela politely.</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at her. She returned the bow even though the other party clearly was a servant. “Miss Elzhier,” she spoke softly.</p>\n<p>“No need to be polite to this servant, Young Lady.”</p>\n<p>“I can’t be impolite to Sister Ryntia’s friends.”</p>\n<p>The Elzhier Family maidservant smiled. Since Bhela insisted, then she wouldn’t be bowing her head anymore.</p>\n<p>She said, “Eldest Young Lady sends me to ask for your forgiveness for her brother’s brashness, Young Lady Bhela.”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at the brawl that started in her family’s courtyard. This chaos would spell imperfect on tonight's Malikh Family’s Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>“There’s no need for that. Since I accepted Young Lady Mila Yashura’s duel then I somewhat anticipated Young Master Bonithon will follow suit to make trouble tonight. If anything, it is I the one who should apologize to Sister Ryntia because I couldn’t handle the situation well. Please tell her that I’ll try to maintain friendship between Malikh and Elzhier Family.”</p>\n<p>Still with the serene smile on her face, the Elzhier Family maidservant studied the expression on Bhela’s face. She spoke a moment after, “Then I’ll let Eldest Young Lady Elzhier knows by tomorrow.”</p>\n<p>“Thanks,” Bhela offered her gratitude with a bow.</p>\n<p>By this time, the brawl became anything but intensified, as men either from Elzhier Family or thugs that previously had dealings with Bony’s group came in to reinforce the Elzhier young master. Before the Malikhs could pressure the intruders with numbers, but then the completely overwhelmed by the new reinforcement.</p>\n<p>“Huurraaahh!” Pilek sent a Malikh man flying with his kick. “Where the fuck your previous cocky taunt? Cat got your tongue, eh?”</p>\n<p>The only unspoken rules in brawls were strictly no usage of mana and spell as well as no sharp objects to use as weapons. But when it was chaotic and nobody could watch everybody the sharpest mind with tricks the one who prevailed--this is why the likes of Pilek and his friend Polio who always struck in place people wouldn’t be willing the one who were taking the advantage in brawls. Even hunters and seasoned guards were no match against these naughty brats.</p>\n<p>For example, when Pilek’s punch was blocked by Elder Jhamil’s son, “You shitty brat, just wait till I deal with your father--kuukgghh!”</p>\n<p>And because no one was watching, Pilek used his knee to strike the cocky young elder in the balls.</p>\n<p>With a sad whimper from his trembling lips, Elder Jhamil’s son curled onto the ground holding his precious balls that Polio struck.</p>\n<p>Seeing that a family elder was mercilessly defeated, a few Malikhs came to avenge their young elder. By then, Pilek already had Polio watching over his back.</p>\n<p>At that point, no Malikhs could match them in hand-in-hand brawl.</p>\n<p>A stranger then casually walked in. Pilek stopped, looking at him, and amidst the chaotic scene it took a while for him to find out that the man was actually a foreigner--an eastern Kaya man. The man had a sheathed sword on his hips. But Pilek wasn’t afraid as long as he stick with the brawl rules to use only fighting unarmed.</p>\n<p>“Huurraaah!”</p>\n<p>Pilek threw a feint. Most simple Malikhs would fall for this. But the eastern Kaya man didn’t budge. Seemed to even anticipate it. With a movement too fast for Pilek to follow the man grabbed his wrist, flicked him and sent him into the air like it was nothing.</p>\n<p>It was only after Pilek rolled in the mud he realized what had happened.</p>\n<p>The man then glanced aside and walked toward Polio who in his own right was too engrossed with the brawl. With his left hand pushing Polio’s shoulder and the other hand grabbing his wrist, he flipped Polio just like he did Pilek beforehand.</p>\n<p>Pilek and a few others that the man previously flipped were amazed by how effortlessly the man disabling enthusiastic young men from fighting.</p>\n<p>The sword handle the man had was wrapped with cloth and its body too thin for regular blades. Those who noticed this would understand that the man wasn’t an ordinary Kaya. Polio was one of them.</p>\n<p>“A Samurai!” he exclaimed a moment after he got thrown onto the muddy ground.</p>\n<p>The Kaya man stopped, looking at him, then spoke with a displeased tone, “I am but a masterless ronin.”</p>\n<p>The man then continued walking toward a different direction.</p>\n<p>Bony was fighting with three men alone, so he couldn’t afford to look around. He didn’t realize the Kaya man at first, but when the man tried to grab the wild young master’s wrist, Bony reacted--he reacted by throwing a punch to the man’s face.</p>\n<p>The man slapped his flying fist from the side, tremendously muffled its momentum. Again, he tried to grab Bony’s wrist and his shoulder. Bony tried resisting but the man’s speed was too fast for him to compete.</p>\n<p>As the man prepared to flip him, Bony felt a faint gush of the wind from his legs. It didn’t take him a second to realize the man just putting his hand on his shoulder as a feint--his real target was to gently nudge his foot on rooting from the ground, which, if he’d focus his effort to get his shoulder free from the man’s grasp, a small window of opening that could be used by his opponent to disrupt his sense of balance. Thus Bony firmly stomped his feet to the ground instead. He grabbed the man’s sleeve to make his opponent not be able to easily throw like Pilek and Polio.</p>\n<p>Responding to Bony’s choice, the man curled the corner of his lips. Bony caught a hint of taunt when he staring the man in the eyes.</p>\n<p>“Kkuuuggghh!”</p>\n<p>Bony did succeed in preventing himself get flipped to the ground. But he got struck in the gut instead.</p>\n<p>The man didn’t let him go. The moment Bony stepping backward due to shock having stricken, the man was charging and got his wrist in the blink of the eyes--what happened afterward was Bony got his feet swept and he completely lost his ground, and got cheered by his friends as the last man who got thrown into the mud.</p>\n<p>Bony then sat there looking as the fight stopped; since someone took him down, more and less the Malikhs had won the brawl.</p>\n<p>“Aren’t you Thoqek’s son?” the Kaya man asked Bony.</p>\n<p>Bony wasn’t willing to open his mouth when his father’s name got mentioned.</p>\n<p>Receiving no answer, the man thus carelessly said, “Unexpectedly, you’ve got more guts than your father. Get up now, and stop making trouble in Ghalim Malikh’s home.”</p>\n<p>The young ruffians with Bony as the leader naturally wouldn’t be arrogant anymore since they had been defeated. They retreated calmly, and the Malikhs didn’t dare taunt them the second time in case Bony would change his mind and started on a rampage again. In the end, the real reason why Bony came targeting Malikh Family, as many people knew, was that he wasn’t a drinker that would lose reason to punch another family’s elder in the face.</p>\n<p>Speaking about an elder who got a punch in the face; after Bony and others were gone, Elder Jhamil showed his nose out of his hiding place. He gritted his teeth. He swore he’d use his full resource to get back from Bony’s father in the next village council meeting.</p>\n<p>“Elder Jhamil, you still haven’t announced the thing I ask you to do,” from behind, the sullen young noble Frane Blackwood said to him.</p>\n<p>“Y-young Master Blackwood, please spare me--the mood isn’t that good to draw people’s attention after that kid crashing our Ngajen Ceremony just now. How about I brief it to other village leaders tomorrow in the village council meeting?”</p>\n<p>“No, I want everyone to know it by tonight. This is the right time and the right place to announce it. Besides, I want to see what kind of a young man the one who’s supposed to be my rival.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil didn’t want to show his beaten face to the crowd tonight. But as much as he love his face he knew flattery wouldn’t get him out of this situation--at least not if he didn’t want to offend the young noble. And so with a heavy face he climbed the table once again, hiding off his reluctancy.</p>\n<p>Someone heartily made a joke on him, “Elder Jhamil, we thought you’re a man who care about face the most--I don’t expect you to boldly show how handsome you’ve become now!”</p>\n<p>“Kids nowadays getting big headed by their privileges as young masters--naturally I’ll let their fathers know how to discipline their brats!” Elder Jhamil coldly said. “Anyway, you all know that my Young Lady Bhela is a girl with talent and her future is boundless. Here in Malikh Family we’re not willing to throw our princess to cow’s dunk that is Yashura Family’s trash young master. And our friend Young Noble Frane Blackwood also thinks the same!”</p>\n<p>Such passionate speech, naturally people were cheering in anticipation of the next spectacle they thought they were going to witness.</p>\n<p>Getting the cue from Elder Jhamil, Frane Blackwood came forward with a swagger. “I speak this as a close friend of Young Lady Bhela Malikh. Someone with the name of Shira Yashura; if you think you’re worthy of her, do you dare to prove it by having a duel with me?!”</p>\n<p>The crowd was silent. They were waiting for the reply.</p>\n<p>Frane Blackwood swept the crowd with his eyes.</p>\n<p>Someone said to him the boy he challenged was utter trash. He was amused guessing how this trash would respond to his duel challenge, especially when Bhela Malikh had just completely defeated the cheeky young lady from his family.</p>\n<p>There were already murmurs spreading. People were also curious whether Shira was going to accept or run away from it.</p>\n<p>And then…</p>\n<p>“<em>Cough, cough…</em>” someone awkwardly stepped forward with a wry smile plastered on his face. People recognized his face, which looked like a monkey, and many of them had seen him together with Shira Yashura.</p>\n<p>He was Monkey. He said, “This young noble… about your proposed duel… I’m afraid Young Master Shira Yashura can’t answer it tonight.”</p>\n<p>Frane Blackwood laughed. “Why? He’s scared? His cousin challenged Young Lady Bhela to a duel for no apparent reason; don’t tell me we can do the same to them?”</p>\n<p>“No, it’s not that.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil pointed his finger at Monkey. “We all know Shira Yashura is a trash who can’t even advance to Level 4 Novice! Young Master Frane Blackwood is kind. Tonight, he’s going to give Shira one chance to admit that he’s unworthy of Young Lady Bhela Malikh to the crowd here. He does that, and there will be no need for Young Master Frane Blackwood to embarrass him by kicking his ass!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, but he can’t give you an answer tonight,” Monkey insisted.</p>\n<p>Now it was Elder Jhamil who laughed. “He’s really scared facing Young Master Frane right now?!”</p>\n<p>“No…”</p>\n<p>“Then why?”</p>\n<p>Monkey sighed.</p>\n<p>“Because he’s already gone home!”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was furious. The whole point he had to gather people even though his face had been beaten by Bony was to call out the boy and embarrass him in public, as per the young noble request. But the said person himself already went home, so Elder Jhamil standing on top of the table was for nothing.</p>\n<p>Immediately he ordered a servant to send the message to Yashura Family, while in between, cursing the fact that he didn’t get the chance to distract the guests from discussing the previous brawl. Sure enough, not only the people were talking about Bhela Malikh’s hidden Unique Class, they were also talking about Bony, and people he beat to pulp, especially Elder Jhamil. People no longer cared to gossip about Young Lady Mila Yashura who had been sent home defeated, but they laughed at someone present who had just his misfortune like Elder Jhamil instead.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil had lost his face in the end. Literally and metaphorically.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, with a solemn expression Monkey looked at his partner Snake who was enjoying the banquet and had amused himself watching the spectacle previously.</p>\n<p>Monkey said with a whisper, “Why the hell your family doesn’t show his face when they dumping shit to Young Master and Young Lady Yashura just now?!”</p>\n<p>Snake glanced at him lazily. “I don’t know. They said they were going to diagnose Patriarch Ghalim Malikh previously.”</p>\n<p>“Can’t you just fetch your brother instead? Didn’t you put your words to assure young master before this? What if he thinks we’re people who put our words lightly?”</p>\n<p>“The one who’s diagnosing the patriarch is my grandfather, my brother supposed to be free enough to be a busybody just now,” Snake said, displeased by Monkey’s tone accusing him of being unloyal to his own word.</p>\n<p>Actually, he also confused why his brother didn’t show his nose when Young Lady Mila recklessly brought a sword to challenge Bhela to a duel. From his understanding of his brother’s character and the relationship between his family and Yashura from what he knew told him that more or less his brother was going to back Yashura if the drama with Malikh Family intensified. But he didn’t. Snake would barge into Malikh Family’s doors to look for his grandfather if he knew it was going to be like this instead.</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-1/chapter-5-1":"<authors-note id=\"Radhy\" type=\"danger\">\n<p>I don’t recommend reading from here onwards because the chapter below is still from the previous draft, which is different from the previous 4 chapters. Further edits will be made that most likely makes this chapter quite different than the current one.</p>\n</authors-note>\n<p>In a certain hall in Malikh Family’s left wing complex, four people sat idly on the bamboo mats covered floor. They were being served local-specialty ginger drinks mixed with brown sugar with herbs to drink. There were also some roasted peanuts to chew. Despite they dressed humbly when attending the Ngajen Ceremony, three of them were elders with statuses, while one of them, the sword bearing Kaya man, wasn’t anyone to ignore either.</p>\n<p>Having knowing this, they still waiting for their host, Bhela Malikh, to wrap up the Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>“Still,” Madame Sylvia said after a sip of ginger drink, “I wouldn’t have expected the girl’s talent to be that rare when she approached my sect with the invitation. The top brass only interested of her being the top grade during the seminar thus sent me to check her out. How about you, Mister Harrington?”</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t expecting it either. I only interested when the report said she showed a potential of being two elemental-affinities Archer. Three already great, but with four elementals, chances she’ll get her name down in history books.”</p>\n<p>“That is what happen if she able to live long enough to develop her full potential,” the quiet man with sharp aura remarked. His face was thin, rough, and since he never liked to smile, he always looked like he meant business. The man was role model of eastern Kaya race ancient warriors--stand and sit in straight posture, humorless, and most importantly, always bringing the sharp, thin sword of katana on his hips.</p>\n<p>Madame Sylvia was interested on his remark. So she asked, “Oh, why you think of that, Sir Kurusiya?”</p>\n<p>The eastern man replied, “Because she tangled herself with Blackwood Family,” he paused. “If this Blackwood the same one from this Blackwood guy I know, then it’s definitely a bad news for her.”</p>\n<p>Mister Harrington from Elemental Stone School disagreed.</p>\n<p>“Since when our factions become soft?” he questioned. “We’re not that pitiful to handle some second-rate noble family. Honestly, I think that young man from that Blackwood Family such a pest. If Young Lady Bhela asks for my favor, I’ll handle him cleanly and thoroughly--right here, right now.”</p>\n<p>“I’m not talking about Blackwood Family, I’m talking about the creepy guy with Blackwood as his last name,” Sir Kurusiya said as he put down his ginger drink. He wasn’t happy, so Madame Sylvia signaled Mister Harrington that it best not to continue arguing with the scary eastern Kaya man.</p>\n<p>The hall suddenly turned quiet. Then, the fourth man was happily enjoyed his drink, out of the blue he blurted for his opinion that no one asked for. “That boy from Yashura Family is sure interesting…”</p>\n<p>Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia smiled wryly. Nobody said anything about Yashura Family up until now. The fourth man, Baront Staterwind, came from a very peculiar faction. Which actually had nothing to do with Bhela’s type of talent. Even when he had already came to Badril Village, none would think he accepted Bhela Malikh’s invitation just to scout her talent.</p>\n<p>The hall’s door was knocked. Bhela entered. She politely greeted the four respected guests before she sat down.</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry for the wait, dear elders. Malikh Family hasn’t prepared the best dishes for you during the ceremony, so I asked the best chef we have to cook special meals for you,” Bhela said, then she glanced at the door. “Please enter, aunty!”</p>\n<p>The moment she called, a middle-aged woman who helped Bhela in the kitchen before came with a line of maidservants, bringing freshly cooked dinner meals with them. It was better than what the Malikhs served for the guests before, even compared to the meals served for the family’s important guests cooked by Bhela as the chief chef.</p>\n<p>“I rather you serve me some alcohol,” the eastern Sir Kurusiya said to her.</p>\n<p>Bhela nodded at his request and asked the aunty to fetch the best alcohol she could find. Of course, the best person to get help was the elder who provided Bhela with the hall to host her guests. Bhela hoped the said elder already knew the importance of this meeting thus not being stingy with his alcohol collection.</p>\n<p>“Can we start now, young lady? I don’t have a good alcohol tolerance so I rather get this completed before us adults get to drink,” Madame Sylvia said.</p>\n<p>“We have delicious food here served, Madame Sylvia. To be honest, all the wait before is for the aunties preparing dinner for dear elders,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>But not of the adults believed her words easily.</p>\n<p>“Hoho, you seem so nervous, young lady. You might not look like it, but you seem about to cry,” Sir Baront Staterwind said.</p>\n<p>“Just state what you want from us, don’t waste anymore time,” Sir Kurusiya urged.</p>\n<p>Bhela lowered her head. With her lips tremblingly parted, she said, “As you might know, my father fell ill when I was overseas attending the seminar. My mother has contacted many doctors and alchemists to make medicines for him, yet my father’s condition never improved. I request for elders’ wisdom and strength, please help my poor father, he was in misery for months…”</p>\n<p>Bhela prostated.</p>\n<p>“Please, help me father… he’s dying… please…” she begged.</p>\n<p>Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia exchanged glances. The peculiar beardy man, Sir Baront, merely nodded without letting his thoughts known. Meanwhile, Sir Kurusiya, who didn’t bulge seeing the pretty girl begging in front of him, coldly said, “Well, this is really a waste of time.”</p>\n<p>Hearing the eastern man snorted, Bhela’s heart went cold. She prepared herself bowing down for help, without stating a single offer to prove how desperate herself.</p>\n<p>“And, young lady…” Madame Sylvia asked slowly, “what would you do if someone managed to heal your father?”</p>\n<p>Bhela rose up. She looked straight to Madam Sylvia’s gaze, then said, “Anything,”</p>\n<p>“Anything?”</p>\n<p>“Anything.”</p>\n<p>The room went quiet. Only Mister Harrington’s regretful sigh could be heard.</p>\n<p>It was Sir Baront Staterwind who explained with a good intention, “It really seems you haven’t grasped the situation you were in, young lady. The guest who gave you the gift from before, he’s a young master of a family known as the peerless medicine makers and doctors. If they couldn’t cure your father illness, then I believe no one in this room knows who really can.”</p>\n<p>“If I had a petty mind, young lady, I’d kill for the cosmetic you got from them. That’s how valuable their skills are,” Madam Sylvia said as she shook her head in pity.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh bit her lips. She was eloquent when she invited these experts months ago. Yet tonight, she had completely became tongue-tied and defeated. The cold air suddenly felt more unbearable. Although the warm meals’ delicious aroma wafted through the hall, not a single person had any incentive to touch their food. Everyone in the hall sunken into silence.</p>\n<p>“You want my advice, young lady?” the sharp voice of Sir Kurusiya sliced through the awkward atmosphere. He continued, “Having turned your back against Yashura Family is the dumbest decision you did. I didn’t come here because of you. I know your father, and I certainly know that swordsman from Yashura Family more. It’s a pity I couldn’t meet them today. Really, a complete waste miles and miles of journey.”</p>\n<p>With that, Sir Kurusiya, stood up and prepared to leave.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh quickly swallowed her bitterness, also stood up and said, “Please, Elder Kurusiya, let me see you the way out.”</p>\n<p>“No, don’t,” Sir Kurusiya flatly rejected her offer. “Sit down. These three fogies still haven’t decided what they want to do with you. Better think carefully about what you’re going to say to them next.”</p>\n<p>The eastern man saw himself out. Following his suggestion, Bhela Malikh sat down again and faced the three experts, with her mind suddenly became as blank as a barren field in the corner of abandoned land. She didn’t know what she ought to say to them, seeing the looks of pity they directed at her. Then, just when she managed to regain her bravery to say something, the door slammed open--</p>\n<p>“I come as the representative of Blackwood Family!” Young Master Frane Blackwood boldly yelled.</p>\n<p>He swagered himself in along with Elder Jhamil’s son and the adjutant of Blackwood Family under his wings. The arrogant behaviour of this young noble completely disregard the experts in the room. Madame Sylvia had enough. She dissed him, “What are you doing here uninvited?”</p>\n<p>Instead of the adjutant who usually spoke for his young master, it was the young elder of Malikh Family, Elder Jhamil’s son who replying. “This madam has eyes but doesn’t know what good for her. Of course Young Master Blackwood is invited! He’s the special guest of Malikh Family after all!”</p>\n<p>“What’s your name, boy?” the middle-aged woman hissed.</p>\n<p>“I’m Elder Jhamil’s eldest son! What’s up with you, you don’t have the right to know my name!”</p>\n<p>“Is that it? Very well. It seems just because I respect the southerner custom by dressing commonly you ignorant people already forgot what's best for you. Very well!”</p>\n<p><em>Zziiing!</em></p>\n<p>With a flashing draw of metallic sword, Madame Sylvia stood up to give this ignorant young elder a lesson. But her companion Mister Harrington quickly pulled her back before things really blown up.</p>\n<p>“You brought a weapon with you!” the Elder Jhamil’s son screamed with his finger pointing at Madame Sylvia who already trembling holding back her fury. “Do you not know what’s gonna happen to guests who bring weapons inside their host’s home?”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood rolled his eyes and told his adjutant, “Send this toad out of here, he’s too noisy!”</p>\n<p>“Right away,” the adjutant said. Then with his bony hands, he pulled the screaming Elder Jhamil’s son forcefully.</p>\n<p>“Is the discussion still ongoing?” Frane Blackwood asked the sitting guests as he tightened the blue necktie he wore. He said to Bhela, “Blackwood Family offers a lifetime terms of benefit for you, young lady. Not only medicines, if it boost potion you ask, or equipments, magic items, weapons--you name it, we have all things you’d dare to imagine!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho,” his uninvited offer gave Sir Baront Staterwind a chuckle. The three guests Bhela invited hailed from their own factions, so even if they wanted to rope Bhela in, they would consult with their higher ups about the specific terms they’d give to her as benefits. However, Blackwood Family was, in fact, only a noble family, not an organizational faction, with the only way in was through marriage--so of course the young noble would be able to offer a “lifetime benefits” to her so brazenly.</p>\n<p>“Thank you for holding back your anger, Madame Sylvia,” Bhela completely bowed her head to the angry guest while she completely disregarded Young Master Blackwood’s offers.</p>\n<p>Madame Sylvia nodded. She then looked at Young Master Blackwood and snorted. “Young lady, think carefully about what we said before. Some incapable people only able to spout honey trap to get what they want. Don’t be foolish because your father’s situation.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you for the advice…”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood wanted to argue with this lady. But he also held himself back as he didn’t know the other party’s identity. Therefore, all he could do was haughtily smiling elegantly as a proper noble as he was.</p>\n<p>“Has the discussion already started?” Frane Blackwood asked again. Pity him, not even one interested in answering. Because of that his face became red as he fumed with anger.</p>\n<p>“Ah,” Sir Baront Staterwind looked outside the window and slapped his thigh, “look how late it is! I planned to sleep early because I have something I need to do tomorrow early in the morning!”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh quickly offered to see him till the gate.</p>\n<p>“Hoho, how about you two?” Sir Baront asked the last two foreign experts, the pair of middle-aged man and woman, “overstaying your visit is considering a burden to these good Mossack folks, don’t you think so?”</p>\n<p>“I’m but an ignorant western lady, I know little about the way of the southern people, so please don’t mind us being shameless,” Madame Sylvia said. She then looked at Bhela, “Young Lady Bhela, Mister Harrington and I apparently haven’t booked our place in the village’s inns. We don’t know our talks would turned out dragged this late. For this I have to beg you to let us stay in Malikh Family for a few good days.”</p>\n<p>“Hoho…” Sir Baront Staterwind chuckled as he looked at the poker face pair of experts. Wasn’t the four of them--including Sir Kurusiya, checked in the same inn this afternoon? It was clear Madame Sylvia and Mister Harrington had their own intentions, thus Sir Baront Staterwind shrugged the idea of exposing their little white lies.</p>\n<p>And with that, Bhela Malikh led the three expert guests she invited out of the room. Young Master Blackwood, who was ignored so hard she almost exploded, yelling, “Young Lady Bhela!”</p>\n<p>Bhela turned around. “Yes, Young Master Blackwood?”</p>\n<p>“How about me?”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh blinked. Then she picked a bowl of roasted peanuts and approached him, saying softly, “Please sit down and enjoy this snack. I need to attend to my guests.”</p>\n<p>Hearing her soft, yet slightly cold voice, Young Lady Blackwood the understood something that made him excited, so excited he obediently sat down and nimbled on the roasted peanuts the beautiful Young Lady Bhela gave him.</p>\n<p>Then after Bhela brought the guests out, the Blackwood Family adjutant who was waiting outside came in inside the hall.</p>\n<p>“What are you doing?!” Young Master Blackwood hissed.</p>\n<p>The adjutant gawked. “Young master, I’m here to serve you…”</p>\n<p>“Serve me?” the young master cringed. What a joke! Soon he’d have a time being alone with Young Lady Bhela, and this old man wanted to be here right when he had the chance of his lifetime? What if there--during the discussion--was an accident where he had to be responsible as a man? Would he be happy if the adjutant was here when that happened?</p>\n<p>Absolutely not!</p>\n<p>“Get out! Don’t dawdle around here tonight! I need to discuss an important manner with Young Lady Bhela secretly!”</p>\n<p>“Y-young master--”</p>\n<p>“What are you waiting for! Go back to the inn and don’t bother me till the next morning!”</p>\n<p>The adjutant naturally understood what was inside the young master’s mind. He didn’t dare to linger around. With careful steps, he closed the door and went back to the inn Blackwood Family checked in.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Young Master Blackwood was so excited he couldn’t sit calmly alone in the hall. The thought of having private discussion with a girl as pretty as Bhela Malikh made him thinking a lot of things. Slowly, he getting horny.</p>\n<p>“What is taking her so long?” he mumbled to himself after waiting a fruitless thirty minutes. “Is it maybe she needs to… prepare, herself?”</p>\n<p>If it was going to be her first time, of course she needed time to prepare herself, Young Master Blackwood thought. This young noble had “befriend” and participating in “private discussions” with many experienced women. But virgin girls, he never tasted any.</p>\n<p>Because of that, he willing to wait however much longer for the young lady to prepare herself. And thus, after waiting for another thirty minutes, nothing happened. Nothing happened for the next hour as well. Then, after waiting for nearly three hours alone, the door finally opened…</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela, you finally ready!” Young Master Blackwood snapped out of his sleepy face and excitedly came to greet the visitor. Much to his disappointment, the visitor turned out to be the faithful adjutant.</p>\n<p>“Why is that you?!” Young Master Blackwood roared.</p>\n<p>“Y-young master… let’s get back to the inn,” the adjutant nervously asked.</p>\n<p>“Where’s Young Lady Bhela?”</p>\n<p>“She is in her room…”</p>\n<p>“Then you send someone there to ask her when she’s going to meet me,” the young noble ordered.</p>\n<p>“I’m afraid I can’t… young master…”</p>\n<p>“I’ve been waiting for hours, why?”</p>\n<p>The adjutant gulped before he replied.</p>\n<p>“Because the young lady has already gone sleeping since three hours ago!”</p>\n<p>So much for his dreamy private discussion! Young Master Blackwood was so angry for being misled that he slapped the adjutant’s face all the way back to his inn.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A single torch on a stick stubbornly lit the corner of the village in spite of the strong wind. A howling wolf in the distance reinforced the lone, cold sense of the midnight Badril Village. The only shop that still open at this hours could be counted with one hand, and this liquor shop was one of them. No customer visited it except a foreign eastern Kaya man.</p>\n<p>A series of step could be heard. The sleepy shopkeeper snapped back when he heard a new customer approaching.</p>\n<p>“Give me a glass of <em>tuak</em>, shopkeeper,” the new customer ordered with a booming voice. One could see his beardy feature when his face exposed to the shop’s lantern light. “Mind if I join you, Sir Kurusiya?”</p>\n<p>The eastern man didn’t reply. He drank his alcohol instead.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront Staterwind laughed by his cold treatment. The beardy guy was an easygoing person, so he casually grabbed a bowl of steamed peanuts and started to nibble on those snacks.</p>\n<p>“You’re not visiting Bhela’s father? You said you know him, you know, saying hi to a sick old buddy?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t say hi to a dying man,” Sir Kurusiya said.</p>\n<p>The answer made the air awkward. So Sir Baront quickly came with another topic.</p>\n<p>“It seems those two lovers adamant to protect the girl,” he said, referring to the other two experts who once were couple before Mister Harrington lost Madame Sylvia to another guy. “Or I think they just want some privacy to have some little reunion… who knows?”</p>\n<p>Sir Kurusiya never bothered with petty gossip, he callously replied, “They don’t know Malikh Family. They can’t protect her forever.”</p>\n<p>“Exactly,” Sir Baront Staterwind agreed. After that both men continued drinking without saying anything.</p>\n<p>“Hey shopkeeper,” Sir Baront called, “don’t you have anything with less alcohol? I have a business I’d like to deal with tomorrow, so I want to avoid shitty hangover.”</p>\n<p>“I have some sweet <em>tuak</em>,” the shopkeeper poured a new bottle into Sir Baront’s empty glass, “this one usually for them boys who haven’t gone coming of age ceremony. No alcohol, costs as little as four copper kobe coins.”</p>\n<p>“Four coppers, ah! Why’s that the souther I go the cheaper the drink?” he sipped it, “mm! Pretty good, my good man!”</p>\n<p>He tipped the shopkeeper with a silver coin. The shopkeeper was dumbfounded but quickly recovered and hid the coin safely.</p>\n<p>Sir Kurusiya said to Sir Baront, “You want to go to Yashura Family tomorrow?”</p>\n<p>“How did you know?”</p>\n<p>“Even though I can’t see him, I know the one who repelled Bhela’s arrow was a Nalaq,” Sir Kurusiya said.</p>\n<p>“Hoho, since I managed to rope in the young lady of Yurin Family, I’ve got promoted to an instructor,” Sir Baront smiled widely. “Doing the legwork isn’t my job anymore… but checking him and the boy won’t hurt, so I’m going. Hmm, I wonder if the Nalaq has already form his contract?”</p>\n<p>“Huuh…” the shopkeeper, who had been hearing their chatting, couldn’t help but asked, “you good sir, what’s this talking about a Nalaq having to do with Yashura Family?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, you’re a Yashura?” Sir Baront asked.</p>\n<p>“I’m Elzhier, from the outer family,” the shopkeeper said. “I’ve been in this village for forty years, but never I’ve heard any Nalaq passing by.”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, that’s why I’m going. Usually a rogue Nalaq isn’t someone tied with a faction, so they aren’t that big of deal--which also make them easier to rope in!”</p>\n<p>“Ooohh! Are you a Nalaq expert, mister? From overseas? Our family’s eldest young lady actually was scouted by a passing expert from overseas too, an expert from purple something sect!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, you mean Purple Garden Sect?” Sir Baront Staterwind and asked as he played along.</p>\n<p>But Sir Kurusiya was sceptic. “Purple Garden Sect is too far. And someone from that kind of superpower faction won’t be too idle to accidentally passing by on this kind of rural village.”</p>\n<p>Sir Baront nodded at Sir Kurusiya’s logic. Even if it was that particular sect that accepted the said young lady, both experts wouldn’t be too sure about whether she could be the sect’s legitimate disciple. Their doubts made the shopkeeper embarrassed. Since ten years ago, the tales of the eldest young lady of Elzhier Family being accepted by a foreign expert was a legend amongst Badril Village locals. Except her and the recent Malikh Family’s young lady, no one in the village was lucky got scouted to study oversea, so it became a fact that Elzhier Family was very proud of--and was one of the reasons why the Elzhier could win the village head’s seat from Yashura Family after their decades of leading Badril Village. But the problem was, in the letters their young lady sent home, she always talked about shops, fashions, and some other trivial stuffs that usually young women her age excited about. That made even her father, the current Elzhier Family’s patriarch and the Village Head, felt it was became difficult to still boasting the young lady’s status after ten years of her spending overseas.</p>\n<p>“But still, experts, you might not know this, but our eldest young lady was Young Lady of Malikh Family’s closest childhood friend! When Young Lady Bhela Malikh only a little girl our young lady gave her a lot of pointers and knowledge, so much that I assure that if it wasn’t for her being there for Young Lady Bhela, the Malikh Family wouldn’t get their talented Unique Class for at least the next one hundred years!”</p>\n<p>“Right…” Sir Baront became awkward instantly. To think some ignorant folks believed blessing of Unique Classes was that simple, even Sir Kurusiya scoffed at the idea.</p>\n<p>The shopkeeper’s face became red as he realized it was wise not to delay any longer. So he quickly said, “If you have some spare time, sir experts, I’m sure our Elzhier Family willing to entertain you!”</p>\n<p>After paying for their drinks, even the agreeable Sir Baront Staterwind felt it was very awkward for him to return to this little shop. Both decided not to get themselves involved with Elzhier Family after the shopkeeper’s little salesman talks, whilst not knowing the inn they stayed inn owned by Elzhier Family.</p>\n<p>On the way back, Sir Baront asked Sir Kurusiya for advice.</p>\n<p>“Yo, Kurusiya, I’m going to accept the Yashura boy as my third disciple if the Nalaq’s pretty good. But, you know, the Nalaq who contracted with youngest disciple is a master thirteen thousands years ago. She was a heavy weight figure, so I reckon I’ll let her calls the shot. What’s your opinion on this?”</p>\n<p>“How powerful is this Nalaq you’re talking about?”</p>\n<p>Sir Baront grinned. “You know the legend about Seven Pillars of Tiramikal Continent? She’s the Frost Mage mentioned in that history. Pretty neat, huh? She was able to revive as Nalaq and regained her consciousness five years ago. All the big shots in my Blue Robe Society can’t wait for the girl she’s contracted with to formally accepted into our faction.”</p>\n<p>“If that’s the case then your disciple isn’t necesserily worse than Malikh’s four elemental Archer girl.”</p>\n<p>“So you know why I can’t accept the boy if he’s too crude--I can’t afford to offend this madam Nalaq even the slightest bit.” he took out a bag of roasted peanuts he bought from the shopkeeper, and started to nibble on them. “I’m going to write a letter to my disciples, they’ve been playing around in the neighboring village. This madam Nalaq will come and check the boy herself.”</p>\n<p>Sir Kurusiya abruptly stopped his steps.</p>\n<p>“You want my advice?” he looked straight at Sir Baront’s eyes. “My advice is simple. You’re going to make this madam Nalaq of yours polite and you’re going to beg her to be mindful of her attitude in front of Yashura Family.”</p>\n<p>“You’re joking? You serious?”</p>\n<p>“I’m always serious,” Sir Kurusiya said.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Patriarch of Yashura Family, Shuro Yashura, was exhilarated to see Grandpa Piss and Snotty came to visit the village. One part because he treasured the friendships between their family and Grandpa Piss’s relatives, but mainly, he got to show-off his latest coconut cake recipe.</p>\n<p>“Ah, this is life, drinking <em>tuak</em> when we’re watching the moon, getting drunk while we’re eating coconuts. What a life!” Patriarch Shuro mumbled.</p>\n<p>“What a life indeed,” Grandpa Piss nodded with a low chuckle. On the sky, the full moon was shining bright really beautiful.</p>\n<p>After he’d done his part in ngajen ceremony, Patriarch Shuro Yashura accompanied the old Alchemist and his grandson in a spacious veranda, where they ate coconut cakes and drinking _tuak _while spending time moongazing. They had the Yashura Family’s sole butler, Yulong, to hold the _tuak _bottle and refilled their cups when empty.</p>\n<p>“Grandpa Piss, why didn’t you tell us beforehand before you visit Badril Village? We ran out of <em>rendang</em> before even the ceremony ended, so I’m sorry if you couldn’t eat <em>rendang</em>!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, we already ate chicken curry in Malikh Family, you don’t have to prepare food for us,” Grandpa Piss said.</p>\n<p>“How about breakfast? Are we still have leftover chickens, Yulong?”</p>\n<p>“We still have some leftover grilled village chicken, I’ll talk with the kitchen to reheat two portion first thing in the morning,” Yulong said.</p>\n<p>The Yashura Family’s patriarch was a role model of the stereotype Mossack people. He loved to cook and loved even more to feed people. It was no wonder why southern Mossacks’ visitors always felt welcomed whenever they visited the southern lands.</p>\n<p>“I sent them to bring <em>rendang</em> to Malikh Family, I never expected something like that to happen, hah!” Patriarch Shuro shook his head with a weak smile plastered on his face. During their talk, Grandpa Piss mentioned they met with Shira and Mila, as well mentioned the duel that happened between the two families’ young ladies and the upcoming duel between Shira and the young noble from Blackwood Family. “Whatever, if jerks wanted to fight with us, we won’t back down. Yashura Family never a coward!”</p>\n<p>“I believe Young Master Shira knows what he has to do,” Grandpa Piss assured.</p>\n<p>“I hope so, pity his father never around to hold the sky falling for him,” Patriarch Shuro gulped his <em>tuak</em>. “Anyway, let’s talk about something else. That Ghalim, you checked on him, Grandpa? What’s happened to him?”</p>\n<p>Snotty a little scared when Shuro Yashura suddenly brought up that topic. Snotty glanced at Butler Yulong’s wrinkled face, Yulong smiled back at him. The big muscle man couldn’t help but shuddered inside.</p>\n<p>“Patriarch Ghalim isn’t feeling well after eating some unhygienic food. I already prescribed some medicine for him, but I don’t know when he’d be able to get back at being patriarch since his digestive system was never good.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, is that so? Never knew he had something like that,” Patriarch Shuro mumbled. “There’s this really bad rumor about him being poisoned, Grandpa Piss, we never had something wicked like that in Badril Village.”</p>\n<p>“No, no no no, I can assure you, it’s not poison. I’ve been in the business more than seventy years--it’s <em>not</em> a poison.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss helped Yashura Family a lot when the patriarch’s in-law, Jhuro’s wife, had Shira in her belly. So Patriarch Shuro had long esteemed Grandpa Piss’s medicinal skill, even though he didn’t really had any idea how skillful the friendly old man was. He believed Grandpa Piss in the end.</p>\n<p>“We shouldn’t talk about sad things, Patriarch. Here, I bought a <em>tuak</em> my family handmade ourself. Let’s give it a try,” Grandpa Piss said.</p>\n<p>“Please, let me,” Butler Yulong asked the <em>tuak</em> bottle Grandpa Piss took out and poured it evenly to Patriarch Shuro’s, Grandpa Piss’s, along with Snotty’s glasses.</p>\n<p>The second thing Patriarch Shuro loved, after coconuts, was a strong <em>tuak</em>. He was the first one to gulp his glass clean, and he sighed about how good Grandpa Piss’s family <em>tuak</em> craft was. However, soon after that, his eyes somehow became heavy.</p>\n<p>“Huhh… usually, I still can drink till dawn…” Patriarch Shuro said with a yawn. “Let’s drink together… come on, Snotty, come drink with Uncle Shuro more.”</p>\n<p>“Patriarch, I think you are tired,” Yulong said softly, rejecting to pour patriarch’s glass.</p>\n<p>“Snotty, you go accompany Uncle Shuro inside,” Grandpa Piss said.</p>\n<p>Snotty nodded while still holding his glass full of <em>tuak</em>. The liquor was definitely mixed with something. Considering it was his grandfather who presented it, it was amazing to see Patriarch Shuro Yashura to be able to resist the urge to sleepiness. Snotty stood up and brought the yawning Shuro Yashura away.</p>\n<p>After both of them gone, Yulong picked up a clean glass. He poured the liquor that made Patriarch Shuro sleepy and drank it for himself. Grandpa Piss took out his second bottle and accompanied Yulong drinking <em>tuak</em>.</p>\n<p>“Is there’s something you need to discuss with me?” Yulong asked.</p>\n<p>“Indeed, it’s about Ghalim Malikh’s real condition…” Grandpa Piss didn’t leave any details when he told the Butler Yulong what had really happened in Malikh Family, particularly his discovery about the true nature of poison that made Patriarch Ghalim bedridden.</p>\n<p>When he heard that shocking fact, there was no surprise in the butler’s old face. Only sorrow and regret.</p>\n<p>“I knew this would happened,” Yulong sighed.</p>\n<p>“Then there’s Blackwood Family too…” Grandpa Piss’s sigh followed. “They seems interested in taking away Young Lady Bhela as a bride… I really don’t know what to say…”</p>\n<p>Yulong drank the <em>tuak</em> and told Grandpa Piss his reasoning, “That boy from Blackwood Family still hasn’t accepted Sir Jhuro’s decission to retire sixteen years ago. He’s been keeping quiet because he knew even the royalty and the organization behind him couldn’t protect him from Old Sir Lharu’s and Old Madam Sari’s retrubution. Time’s change. I reckon there’s some change somewhere that make him cocky.”</p>\n<p>“Old Sir and Old Madam too far away to give help in case something like this happens suddenly. Should I help you and Sir Jhuro keeping tabs on Blackwood Family?” Grandpa Piss asked.</p>\n<p>While Jhuro Yashura left behind resources and men outside before he retired, he almost never interacted with the high society of nobility. For ears and eyes to reach those fancy places, it would take time and efforts for current Yulong and Shuro Yashura to do so. It was way better to ask Grandpa Piss who already familiar due to his family’s generations of Alchemist profession. However, Yulong rejected the offer without giving it a real thought.</p>\n<p>“You don’t need to worry. Blackwood Family only taking a ride of that boy’s ambition. If he really supports his foster family right from the start, Blackwood won’t be stuck with their viscount nobility rank.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss wanted to offer any more help, but he long sensed the old butler’s distrust of him on affairs that didn’t include medicines and elixirs. So he kept his mouth shut for the time being.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, a golden owl landed on the veranda where the two old men enjoyed their <em>tuak</em>. The own brought a small piece of paper and inked quill with it.</p>\n<p>“Go, send this message to Sir Jhuro, as fast as possible!” Butler Yulong said to the owl after he wrote his tiny letter. Then he glanced at Grandpa Piss and said, “this is an owl I keep around in case there’s an emergency. Sir Jhuro also brought one with him.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss nodded with a painful smile. This golden owl was long thought to be extinct, but the reality there were small amounts of them were being kept in case of emergencies. They were rare, almost becoming birds of legend. Small to medium sized kingdoms wouldn’t dare to think getting their hands on it, not to mention Grandpa Piss’s own family. But this old butler had one with him. And the prodigial man of Yashura Family casually brought this treasure bird with him to travel around the southern land.</p>\n<p>“This is really for emergency,” Yulong said coldly, knowing full well the old Alchemist’s envy.</p>\n<p>“I know, I know--for emergency.”</p>\n<p>The owl then flew away bringing Yulong’s letter.</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss and Snotty returned back to their own village the next morning. After sending them away, Yulong found out the young master, Shira Yashura, wanted to go to the market to pick some goods for his contracted pedlers to sell. He was worried the young master’s inexperience getting him exploited. Therefore, he waited in the gate and followed the boy from behind.</p>\n<p>In front of an inn owned by Elzhier Family, Yulong saw a familiar eastern Kaya man came out with a respectable, but humble Mossack man behind him. The Kaya man, Sir Kurusiya, noticed Yulong, immediately cupped his fist and bowed his body. That was a salute of great respect eastern Kaya men usually give to people they regard highly. Sir Baront Staterwind didn’t know what was going on, so he imitated his companion to salute Yulong even though he didn’t really know he was only a butler.</p>\n<p>“You know them, Yulong?” Shira asked.</p>\n<p>“The Kaya man once works in the same place as your father, young master.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, that’s why you know him.” Yulong was his mother helper, and his father brought him along to Yashura Family when Shira still in his mother’s belly. Shira never liked to listen about his father’s past, even though it was often glorified since he was completely stopped marauding bandits from approaching Badril Village. Walking toward the market, Shira kept quiet and didn’t ask the matter any further.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Far away from Badril Village, the golden owl Yulong tasked with the emergency letter flew through walls of mist and mountains. It instinctively knew the location of its recipient, Jhuro Yashura, even though Yulong wasn’t necesserarily knew where he was. Not even a half day passed by since the bird took off from Yashura Family, it flew already more than halfway toward its destination.</p>\n<p>Its speed was unprecendeted amongst the magical beast. No wonder commonfolks thought it was the bird of the legend. It was a shame that it failed to detect a single flash on the horizon, resulting it to succumb to a terrible fate.</p>\n<p><em>Flap flap flap!</em></p>\n<p>The owl futilely tried to avoid danger.</p>\n<p>A single flash all it took to capture the dumbfounded owl. A pair of cold talons gripped its short neck and the next thing it knew, the owl panically flapping its wings in search of oxygen, only to be deprived of fresh air even more. The owl couldn’t see the beast, it only saw a dashingly crimson flash before it was captured by the neck. The hostile beast scretched, only after that the owl realized a damned predator eagle already got it. Annoyed by the owl’s desperate struggle, the eagle broke its neck. The handsome crimson-colored eagle then delivered the dead owl to a mysterious masked man, who then passed it to another man--a pale, thin man who only dressed himself as black as the phantom itself.</p>\n<p>“This owl coming out from Yashura Family, Mister Blackwood. The bird brings a letter with it,” the masked man said as he presented the letter to the pale man.</p>\n<p>“Ah, so they figured it out about the poison,” the pale man with Blackwood surname said. Beside him and the masked man, there was a third man who drained the blood of the golden owl, prepared a little feast of its dead body. The man was very peculiar; bald, with veined oversized muscles that looked like it was almost exploded, and the strange tatooes that covered its body. He was a northern barbarian, the kind that never took orders from civilized men no matter they came from the west, south, or the east. Yet, when the Blackwood guy told him top plucking the dead owl, he obidiently put aside the carcass, not daring to show any hints of disatisfaction.</p>\n<p>“Mister, the young lady of Malikh Family turns out to be a four-elemental Unique Class, she’s a real talent with tremendous potential--your sister tries to take her to Blackwood Family and having a setback because there’s some experts happened to visit Malikh Family. Shall we send anymore resources to help her?”</p>\n<p>“What’s her Blackwood Family have to do with me? It’s already good enough I let her to use my name to coerce people and strengthen her influence in commerce world. She’s getting annoying every time she’s using my toys. That Jhuju’s poison I sent to her only a reminder to Ghalim of our old friendship, my sister should be thankful enough if she gets some benefits from it.”</p>\n<p>The masked man knew the pale man was irritated by his sister’s cockiness. So he excused himself and brought the crimson eagle with him, disappearing into the shadow.</p>\n<p>“We’ve rested enough,” the pale man said as he crumbled the small letter he read. The bald barbarian’s head cocked and he await the order. “Prepare the horses,” the man continued, “I’ve got an old friend I should say hi to.”</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-1/chapter-5":"<authors-note id=\"Radhy\" type=\"danger\">\n<p>I don’t recommend reading from here onwards because the chapter below is still from the previous draft, which is different from the previous 4 chapters. Further edits will be made that most likely makes this chapter quite different than the current one.</p>\n</authors-note>\n<p>In a certain hall in Malikh Family’s left wing complex, four people sat idly on the bamboo mats covered floor. They were being served local-specialty ginger drinks mixed with brown sugar with herbs to drink. There were also some roasted peanuts to chew. Despite they dressed humbly when attending the Ngajen Ceremony, three of them were elders with statuses, while one of them, the sword bearing Kaya man, wasn’t anyone to ignore either.</p>\n<p>Having knowing this, they still waiting for their host, Bhela Malikh, to wrap up the Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>“Still,” Madame Sylvia said after a sip of ginger drink, “I wouldn’t have expected the girl’s talent to be that rare when she approached my sect with the invitation. The top brass only interested of her being the top grade during the seminar thus sent me to check her out. How about you, Mister Harrington?”</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t expecting it either. I only interested when the report said she showed a potential of being two elemental-affinities Archer. Three already great, but with four elementals, chances she’ll get her name down in history books.”</p>\n<p>“That is what happen if she able to live long enough to develop her full potential,” the quiet man with sharp aura remarked. His face was thin, rough, and since he never liked to smile, he always looked like he meant business. The man was role model of eastern Kaya race ancient warriors--stand and sit in straight posture, humorless, and most importantly, always bringing the sharp, thin sword of katana on his hips.</p>\n<p>Madame Sylvia was interested on his remark. So she asked, “Oh, why you think of that, Sir Kurusiya?”</p>\n<p>The eastern man replied, “Because she tangled herself with Blackwood Family,” he paused. “If this Blackwood the same one from this Blackwood guy I know, then it’s definitely a bad news for her.”</p>\n<p>Mister Harrington from Elemental Stone School disagreed.</p>\n<p>“Since when our factions become soft?” he questioned. “We’re not that pitiful to handle some second-rate noble family. Honestly, I think that young man from that Blackwood Family such a pest. If Young Lady Bhela asks for my favor, I’ll handle him cleanly and thoroughly--right here, right now.”</p>\n<p>“I’m not talking about Blackwood Family, I’m talking about the creepy guy with Blackwood as his last name,” Sir Kurusiya said as he put down his ginger drink. He wasn’t happy, so Madame Sylvia signaled Mister Harrington that it best not to continue arguing with the scary eastern Kaya man.</p>\n<p>The hall suddenly turned quiet. Then, the fourth man was happily enjoyed his drink, out of the blue he blurted for his opinion that no one asked for. “That boy from Yashura Family is sure interesting…”</p>\n<p>Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia smiled wryly. Nobody said anything about Yashura Family up until now. The fourth man, Baront Staterwind, came from a very peculiar faction. Which actually had nothing to do with Bhela’s type of talent. Even when he had already came to Badril Village, none would think he accepted Bhela Malikh’s invitation just to scout her talent.</p>\n<p>The hall’s door was knocked. Bhela entered. She politely greeted the four respected guests before she sat down.</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry for the wait, dear elders. Malikh Family hasn’t prepared the best dishes for you during the ceremony, so I asked the best chef we have to cook special meals for you,” Bhela said, then she glanced at the door. “Please enter, aunty!”</p>\n<p>The moment she called, a middle-aged woman who helped Bhela in the kitchen before came with a line of maidservants, bringing freshly cooked dinner meals with them. It was better than what the Malikhs served for the guests before, even compared to the meals served for the family’s important guests cooked by Bhela as the chief chef.</p>\n<p>“I rather you serve me some alcohol,” the eastern Sir Kurusiya said to her.</p>\n<p>Bhela nodded at his request and asked the aunty to fetch the best alcohol she could find. Of course, the best person to get help was the elder who provided Bhela with the hall to host her guests. Bhela hoped the said elder already knew the importance of this meeting thus not being stingy with his alcohol collection.</p>\n<p>“Can we start now, young lady? I don’t have a good alcohol tolerance so I rather get this completed before us adults get to drink,” Madame Sylvia said.</p>\n<p>“We have delicious food here served, Madame Sylvia. To be honest, all the wait before is for the aunties preparing dinner for dear elders,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>But not of the adults believed her words easily.</p>\n<p>“Hoho, you seem so nervous, young lady. You might not look like it, but you seem about to cry,” Sir Baront Staterwind said.</p>\n<p>“Just state what you want from us, don’t waste anymore time,” Sir Kurusiya urged.</p>\n<p>Bhela lowered her head. With her lips tremblingly parted, she said, “As you might know, my father fell ill when I was overseas attending the seminar. My mother has contacted many doctors and alchemists to make medicines for him, yet my father’s condition never improved. I request for elders’ wisdom and strength, please help my poor father, he was in misery for months…”</p>\n<p>Bhela prostated.</p>\n<p>“Please, help me father… he’s dying… please…” she begged.</p>\n<p>Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia exchanged glances. The peculiar beardy man, Sir Baront, merely nodded without letting his thoughts known. Meanwhile, Sir Kurusiya, who didn’t bulge seeing the pretty girl begging in front of him, coldly said, “Well, this is really a waste of time.”</p>\n<p>Hearing the eastern man snorted, Bhela’s heart went cold. She prepared herself bowing down for help, without stating a single offer to prove how desperate herself.</p>\n<p>“And, young lady…” Madame Sylvia asked slowly, “what would you do if someone managed to heal your father?”</p>\n<p>Bhela rose up. She looked straight to Madam Sylvia’s gaze, then said, “Anything,”</p>\n<p>“Anything?”</p>\n<p>“Anything.”</p>\n<p>The room went quiet. Only Mister Harrington’s regretful sigh could be heard.</p>\n<p>It was Sir Baront Staterwind who explained with a good intention, “It really seems you haven’t grasped the situation you were in, young lady. The guest who gave you the gift from before, he’s a young master of a family known as the peerless medicine makers and doctors. If they couldn’t cure your father illness, then I believe no one in this room knows who really can.”</p>\n<p>“If I had a petty mind, young lady, I’d kill for the cosmetic you got from them. That’s how valuable their skills are,” Madam Sylvia said as she shook her head in pity.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh bit her lips. She was eloquent when she invited these experts months ago. Yet tonight, she had completely became tongue-tied and defeated. The cold air suddenly felt more unbearable. Although the warm meals’ delicious aroma wafted through the hall, not a single person had any incentive to touch their food. Everyone in the hall sunken into silence.</p>\n<p>“You want my advice, young lady?” the sharp voice of Sir Kurusiya sliced through the awkward atmosphere. He continued, “Having turned your back against Yashura Family is the dumbest decision you did. I didn’t come here because of you. I know your father, and I certainly know that swordsman from Yashura Family more. It’s a pity I couldn’t meet them today. Really, a complete waste miles and miles of journey.”</p>\n<p>With that, Sir Kurusiya, stood up and prepared to leave.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh quickly swallowed her bitterness, also stood up and said, “Please, Elder Kurusiya, let me see you the way out.”</p>\n<p>“No, don’t,” Sir Kurusiya flatly rejected her offer. “Sit down. These three fogies still haven’t decided what they want to do with you. Better think carefully about what you’re going to say to them next.”</p>\n<p>The eastern man saw himself out. Following his suggestion, Bhela Malikh sat down again and faced the three experts, with her mind suddenly became as blank as a barren field in the corner of abandoned land. She didn’t know what she ought to say to them, seeing the looks of pity they directed at her. Then, just when she managed to regain her bravery to say something, the door slammed open--</p>\n<p>“I come as the representative of Blackwood Family!” Young Master Frane Blackwood boldly yelled.</p>\n<p>He swagered himself in along with Elder Jhamil’s son and the adjutant of Blackwood Family under his wings. The arrogant behaviour of this young noble completely disregard the experts in the room. Madame Sylvia had enough. She dissed him, “What are you doing here uninvited?”</p>\n<p>Instead of the adjutant who usually spoke for his young master, it was the young elder of Malikh Family, Elder Jhamil’s son who replying. “This madam has eyes but doesn’t know what good for her. Of course Young Master Blackwood is invited! He’s the special guest of Malikh Family after all!”</p>\n<p>“What’s your name, boy?” the middle-aged woman hissed.</p>\n<p>“I’m Elder Jhamil’s eldest son! What’s up with you, you don’t have the right to know my name!”</p>\n<p>“Is that it? Very well. It seems just because I respect the southerner custom by dressing commonly you ignorant people already forgot what's best for you. Very well!”</p>\n<p><em>Zziiing!</em></p>\n<p>With a flashing draw of metallic sword, Madame Sylvia stood up to give this ignorant young elder a lesson. But her companion Mister Harrington quickly pulled her back before things really blown up.</p>\n<p>“You brought a weapon with you!” the Elder Jhamil’s son screamed with his finger pointing at Madame Sylvia who already trembling holding back her fury. “Do you not know what’s gonna happen to guests who bring weapons inside their host’s home?”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood rolled his eyes and told his adjutant, “Send this toad out of here, he’s too noisy!”</p>\n<p>“Right away,” the adjutant said. Then with his bony hands, he pulled the screaming Elder Jhamil’s son forcefully.</p>\n<p>“Is the discussion still ongoing?” Frane Blackwood asked the sitting guests as he tightened the blue necktie he wore. He said to Bhela, “Blackwood Family offers a lifetime terms of benefit for you, young lady. Not only medicines, if it boost potion you ask, or equipments, magic items, weapons--you name it, we have all things you’d dare to imagine!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho,” his uninvited offer gave Sir Baront Staterwind a chuckle. The three guests Bhela invited hailed from their own factions, so even if they wanted to rope Bhela in, they would consult with their higher ups about the specific terms they’d give to her as benefits. However, Blackwood Family was, in fact, only a noble family, not an organizational faction, with the only way in was through marriage--so of course the young noble would be able to offer a “lifetime benefits” to her so brazenly.</p>\n<p>“Thank you for holding back your anger, Madame Sylvia,” Bhela completely bowed her head to the angry guest while she completely disregarded Young Master Blackwood’s offers.</p>\n<p>Madame Sylvia nodded. She then looked at Young Master Blackwood and snorted. “Young lady, think carefully about what we said before. Some incapable people only able to spout honey trap to get what they want. Don’t be foolish because your father’s situation.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you for the advice…”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood wanted to argue with this lady. But he also held himself back as he didn’t know the other party’s identity. Therefore, all he could do was haughtily smiling elegantly as a proper noble as he was.</p>\n<p>“Has the discussion already started?” Frane Blackwood asked again. Pity him, not even one interested in answering. Because of that his face became red as he fumed with anger.</p>\n<p>“Ah,” Sir Baront Staterwind looked outside the window and slapped his thigh, “look how late it is! I planned to sleep early because I have something I need to do tomorrow early in the morning!”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh quickly offered to see him till the gate.</p>\n<p>“Hoho, how about you two?” Sir Baront asked the last two foreign experts, the pair of middle-aged man and woman, “overstaying your visit is considering a burden to these good Mossack folks, don’t you think so?”</p>\n<p>“I’m but an ignorant western lady, I know little about the way of the southern people, so please don’t mind us being shameless,” Madame Sylvia said. She then looked at Bhela, “Young Lady Bhela, Mister Harrington and I apparently haven’t booked our place in the village’s inns. We don’t know our talks would turned out dragged this late. For this I have to beg you to let us stay in Malikh Family for a few good days.”</p>\n<p>“Hoho…” Sir Baront Staterwind chuckled as he looked at the poker face pair of experts. Wasn’t the four of them--including Sir Kurusiya, checked in the same inn this afternoon? It was clear Madame Sylvia and Mister Harrington had their own intentions, thus Sir Baront Staterwind shrugged the idea of exposing their little white lies.</p>\n<p>And with that, Bhela Malikh led the three expert guests she invited out of the room. Young Master Blackwood, who was ignored so hard she almost exploded, yelling, “Young Lady Bhela!”</p>\n<p>Bhela turned around. “Yes, Young Master Blackwood?”</p>\n<p>“How about me?”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh blinked. Then she picked a bowl of roasted peanuts and approached him, saying softly, “Please sit down and enjoy this snack. I need to attend to my guests.”</p>\n<p>Hearing her soft, yet slightly cold voice, Young Lady Blackwood the understood something that made him excited, so excited he obediently sat down and nimbled on the roasted peanuts the beautiful Young Lady Bhela gave him.</p>\n<p>Then after Bhela brought the guests out, the Blackwood Family adjutant who was waiting outside came in inside the hall.</p>\n<p>“What are you doing?!” Young Master Blackwood hissed.</p>\n<p>The adjutant gawked. “Young master, I’m here to serve you…”</p>\n<p>“Serve me?” the young master cringed. What a joke! Soon he’d have a time being alone with Young Lady Bhela, and this old man wanted to be here right when he had the chance of his lifetime? What if there--during the discussion--was an accident where he had to be responsible as a man? Would he be happy if the adjutant was here when that happened?</p>\n<p>Absolutely not!</p>\n<p>“Get out! Don’t dawdle around here tonight! I need to discuss an important manner with Young Lady Bhela secretly!”</p>\n<p>“Y-young master--”</p>\n<p>“What are you waiting for! Go back to the inn and don’t bother me till the next morning!”</p>\n<p>The adjutant naturally understood what was inside the young master’s mind. He didn’t dare to linger around. With careful steps, he closed the door and went back to the inn Blackwood Family checked in.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Young Master Blackwood was so excited he couldn’t sit calmly alone in the hall. The thought of having private discussion with a girl as pretty as Bhela Malikh made him thinking a lot of things. Slowly, he getting horny.</p>\n<p>“What is taking her so long?” he mumbled to himself after waiting a fruitless thirty minutes. “Is it maybe she needs to… prepare, herself?”</p>\n<p>If it was going to be her first time, of course she needed time to prepare herself, Young Master Blackwood thought. This young noble had “befriend” and participating in “private discussions” with many experienced women. But virgin girls, he never tasted any.</p>\n<p>Because of that, he willing to wait however much longer for the young lady to prepare herself. And thus, after waiting for another thirty minutes, nothing happened. Nothing happened for the next hour as well. Then, after waiting for nearly three hours alone, the door finally opened…</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela, you finally ready!” Young Master Blackwood snapped out of his sleepy face and excitedly came to greet the visitor. Much to his disappointment, the visitor turned out to be the faithful adjutant.</p>\n<p>“Why is that you?!” Young Master Blackwood roared.</p>\n<p>“Y-young master… let’s get back to the inn,” the adjutant nervously asked.</p>\n<p>“Where’s Young Lady Bhela?”</p>\n<p>“She is in her room…”</p>\n<p>“Then you send someone there to ask her when she’s going to meet me,” the young noble ordered.</p>\n<p>“I’m afraid I can’t… young master…”</p>\n<p>“I’ve been waiting for hours, why?”</p>\n<p>The adjutant gulped before he replied.</p>\n<p>“Because the young lady has already gone sleeping since three hours ago!”</p>\n<p>So much for his dreamy private discussion! Young Master Blackwood was so angry for being misled that he slapped the adjutant’s face all the way back to his inn.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A single torch on a stick stubbornly lit the corner of the village in spite of the strong wind. A howling wolf in the distance reinforced the lone, cold sense of the midnight Badril Village. The only shop that still open at this hours could be counted with one hand, and this liquor shop was one of them. No customer visited it except a foreign eastern Kaya man.</p>\n<p>A series of step could be heard. The sleepy shopkeeper snapped back when he heard a new customer approaching.</p>\n<p>“Give me a glass of <em>tuak</em>, shopkeeper,” the new customer ordered with a booming voice. One could see his beardy feature when his face exposed to the shop’s lantern light. “Mind if I join you, Sir Kurusiya?”</p>\n<p>The eastern man didn’t reply. He drank his alcohol instead.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront Staterwind laughed by his cold treatment. The beardy guy was an easygoing person, so he casually grabbed a bowl of steamed peanuts and started to nibble on those snacks.</p>\n<p>“You’re not visiting Bhela’s father? You said you know him, you know, saying hi to a sick old buddy?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t say hi to a dying man,” Sir Kurusiya said.</p>\n<p>The answer made the air awkward. So Sir Baront quickly came with another topic.</p>\n<p>“It seems those two lovers adamant to protect the girl,” he said, referring to the other two experts who once were couple before Mister Harrington lost Madame Sylvia to another guy. “Or I think they just want some privacy to have some little reunion… who knows?”</p>\n<p>Sir Kurusiya never bothered with petty gossip, he callously replied, “They don’t know Malikh Family. They can’t protect her forever.”</p>\n<p>“Exactly,” Sir Baront Staterwind agreed. After that both men continued drinking without saying anything.</p>\n<p>“Hey shopkeeper,” Sir Baront called, “don’t you have anything with less alcohol? I have a business I’d like to deal with tomorrow, so I want to avoid shitty hangover.”</p>\n<p>“I have some sweet <em>tuak</em>,” the shopkeeper poured a new bottle into Sir Baront’s empty glass, “this one usually for them boys who haven’t gone coming of age ceremony. No alcohol, costs as little as four copper kobe coins.”</p>\n<p>“Four coppers, ah! Why’s that the souther I go the cheaper the drink?” he sipped it, “mm! Pretty good, my good man!”</p>\n<p>He tipped the shopkeeper with a silver coin. The shopkeeper was dumbfounded but quickly recovered and hid the coin safely.</p>\n<p>Sir Kurusiya said to Sir Baront, “You want to go to Yashura Family tomorrow?”</p>\n<p>“How did you know?”</p>\n<p>“Even though I can’t see him, I know the one who repelled Bhela’s arrow was a Nalaq,” Sir Kurusiya said.</p>\n<p>“Hoho, since I managed to rope in the young lady of Yurin Family, I’ve got promoted to an instructor,” Sir Baront smiled widely. “Doing the legwork isn’t my job anymore… but checking him and the boy won’t hurt, so I’m going. Hmm, I wonder if the Nalaq has already form his contract?”</p>\n<p>“Huuh…” the shopkeeper, who had been hearing their chatting, couldn’t help but asked, “you good sir, what’s this talking about a Nalaq having to do with Yashura Family?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, you’re a Yashura?” Sir Baront asked.</p>\n<p>“I’m Elzhier, from the outer family,” the shopkeeper said. “I’ve been in this village for forty years, but never I’ve heard any Nalaq passing by.”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, that’s why I’m going. Usually a rogue Nalaq isn’t someone tied with a faction, so they aren’t that big of deal--which also make them easier to rope in!”</p>\n<p>“Ooohh! Are you a Nalaq expert, mister? From overseas? Our family’s eldest young lady actually was scouted by a passing expert from overseas too, an expert from purple something sect!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, you mean Purple Garden Sect?” Sir Baront Staterwind and asked as he played along.</p>\n<p>But Sir Kurusiya was sceptic. “Purple Garden Sect is too far. And someone from that kind of superpower faction won’t be too idle to accidentally passing by on this kind of rural village.”</p>\n<p>Sir Baront nodded at Sir Kurusiya’s logic. Even if it was that particular sect that accepted the said young lady, both experts wouldn’t be too sure about whether she could be the sect’s legitimate disciple. Their doubts made the shopkeeper embarrassed. Since ten years ago, the tales of the eldest young lady of Elzhier Family being accepted by a foreign expert was a legend amongst Badril Village locals. Except her and the recent Malikh Family’s young lady, no one in the village was lucky got scouted to study oversea, so it became a fact that Elzhier Family was very proud of--and was one of the reasons why the Elzhier could win the village head’s seat from Yashura Family after their decades of leading Badril Village. But the problem was, in the letters their young lady sent home, she always talked about shops, fashions, and some other trivial stuffs that usually young women her age excited about. That made even her father, the current Elzhier Family’s patriarch and the Village Head, felt it was became difficult to still boasting the young lady’s status after ten years of her spending overseas.</p>\n<p>“But still, experts, you might not know this, but our eldest young lady was Young Lady of Malikh Family’s closest childhood friend! When Young Lady Bhela Malikh only a little girl our young lady gave her a lot of pointers and knowledge, so much that I assure that if it wasn’t for her being there for Young Lady Bhela, the Malikh Family wouldn’t get their talented Unique Class for at least the next one hundred years!”</p>\n<p>“Right…” Sir Baront became awkward instantly. To think some ignorant folks believed blessing of Unique Classes was that simple, even Sir Kurusiya scoffed at the idea.</p>\n<p>The shopkeeper’s face became red as he realized it was wise not to delay any longer. So he quickly said, “If you have some spare time, sir experts, I’m sure our Elzhier Family willing to entertain you!”</p>\n<p>After paying for their drinks, even the agreeable Sir Baront Staterwind felt it was very awkward for him to return to this little shop. Both decided not to get themselves involved with Elzhier Family after the shopkeeper’s little salesman talks, whilst not knowing the inn they stayed inn owned by Elzhier Family.</p>\n<p>On the way back, Sir Baront asked Sir Kurusiya for advice.</p>\n<p>“Yo, Kurusiya, I’m going to accept the Yashura boy as my third disciple if the Nalaq’s pretty good. But, you know, the Nalaq who contracted with youngest disciple is a master thirteen thousands years ago. She was a heavy weight figure, so I reckon I’ll let her calls the shot. What’s your opinion on this?”</p>\n<p>“How powerful is this Nalaq you’re talking about?”</p>\n<p>Sir Baront grinned. “You know the legend about Seven Pillars of Tiramikal Continent? She’s the Frost Mage mentioned in that history. Pretty neat, huh? She was able to revive as Nalaq and regained her consciousness five years ago. All the big shots in my Blue Robe Society can’t wait for the girl she’s contracted with to formally accepted into our faction.”</p>\n<p>“If that’s the case then your disciple isn’t necesserily worse than Malikh’s four elemental Archer girl.”</p>\n<p>“So you know why I can’t accept the boy if he’s too crude--I can’t afford to offend this madam Nalaq even the slightest bit.” he took out a bag of roasted peanuts he bought from the shopkeeper, and started to nibble on them. “I’m going to write a letter to my disciples, they’ve been playing around in the neighboring village. This madam Nalaq will come and check the boy herself.”</p>\n<p>Sir Kurusiya abruptly stopped his steps.</p>\n<p>“You want my advice?” he looked straight at Sir Baront’s eyes. “My advice is simple. You’re going to make this madam Nalaq of yours polite and you’re going to beg her to be mindful of her attitude in front of Yashura Family.”</p>\n<p>“You’re joking? You serious?”</p>\n<p>“I’m always serious,” Sir Kurusiya said.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Patriarch of Yashura Family, Shuro Yashura, was exhilarated to see Grandpa Piss and Snotty came to visit the village. One part because he treasured the friendships between their family and Grandpa Piss’s relatives, but mainly, he got to show-off his latest coconut cake recipe.</p>\n<p>“Ah, this is life, drinking <em>tuak</em> when we’re watching the moon, getting drunk while we’re eating coconuts. What a life!” Patriarch Shuro mumbled.</p>\n<p>“What a life indeed,” Grandpa Piss nodded with a low chuckle. On the sky, the full moon was shining bright really beautiful.</p>\n<p>After he’d done his part in ngajen ceremony, Patriarch Shuro Yashura accompanied the old Alchemist and his grandson in a spacious veranda, where they ate coconut cakes and drinking _tuak _while spending time moongazing. They had the Yashura Family’s sole butler, Yulong, to hold the _tuak _bottle and refilled their cups when empty.</p>\n<p>“Grandpa Piss, why didn’t you tell us beforehand before you visit Badril Village? We ran out of <em>rendang</em> before even the ceremony ended, so I’m sorry if you couldn’t eat <em>rendang</em>!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, we already ate chicken curry in Malikh Family, you don’t have to prepare food for us,” Grandpa Piss said.</p>\n<p>“How about breakfast? Are we still have leftover chickens, Yulong?”</p>\n<p>“We still have some leftover grilled village chicken, I’ll talk with the kitchen to reheat two portion first thing in the morning,” Yulong said.</p>\n<p>The Yashura Family’s patriarch was a role model of the stereotype Mossack people. He loved to cook and loved even more to feed people. It was no wonder why southern Mossacks’ visitors always felt welcomed whenever they visited the southern lands.</p>\n<p>“I sent them to bring <em>rendang</em> to Malikh Family, I never expected something like that to happen, hah!” Patriarch Shuro shook his head with a weak smile plastered on his face. During their talk, Grandpa Piss mentioned they met with Shira and Mila, as well mentioned the duel that happened between the two families’ young ladies and the upcoming duel between Shira and the young noble from Blackwood Family. “Whatever, if jerks wanted to fight with us, we won’t back down. Yashura Family never a coward!”</p>\n<p>“I believe Young Master Shira knows what he has to do,” Grandpa Piss assured.</p>\n<p>“I hope so, pity his father never around to hold the sky falling for him,” Patriarch Shuro gulped his <em>tuak</em>. “Anyway, let’s talk about something else. That Ghalim, you checked on him, Grandpa? What’s happened to him?”</p>\n<p>Snotty a little scared when Shuro Yashura suddenly brought up that topic. Snotty glanced at Butler Yulong’s wrinkled face, Yulong smiled back at him. The big muscle man couldn’t help but shuddered inside.</p>\n<p>“Patriarch Ghalim isn’t feeling well after eating some unhygienic food. I already prescribed some medicine for him, but I don’t know when he’d be able to get back at being patriarch since his digestive system was never good.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, is that so? Never knew he had something like that,” Patriarch Shuro mumbled. “There’s this really bad rumor about him being poisoned, Grandpa Piss, we never had something wicked like that in Badril Village.”</p>\n<p>“No, no no no, I can assure you, it’s not poison. I’ve been in the business more than seventy years--it’s <em>not</em> a poison.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss helped Yashura Family a lot when the patriarch’s in-law, Jhuro’s wife, had Shira in her belly. So Patriarch Shuro had long esteemed Grandpa Piss’s medicinal skill, even though he didn’t really had any idea how skillful the friendly old man was. He believed Grandpa Piss in the end.</p>\n<p>“We shouldn’t talk about sad things, Patriarch. Here, I bought a <em>tuak</em> my family handmade ourself. Let’s give it a try,” Grandpa Piss said.</p>\n<p>“Please, let me,” Butler Yulong asked the <em>tuak</em> bottle Grandpa Piss took out and poured it evenly to Patriarch Shuro’s, Grandpa Piss’s, along with Snotty’s glasses.</p>\n<p>The second thing Patriarch Shuro loved, after coconuts, was a strong <em>tuak</em>. He was the first one to gulp his glass clean, and he sighed about how good Grandpa Piss’s family <em>tuak</em> craft was. However, soon after that, his eyes somehow became heavy.</p>\n<p>“Huhh… usually, I still can drink till dawn…” Patriarch Shuro said with a yawn. “Let’s drink together… come on, Snotty, come drink with Uncle Shuro more.”</p>\n<p>“Patriarch, I think you are tired,” Yulong said softly, rejecting to pour patriarch’s glass.</p>\n<p>“Snotty, you go accompany Uncle Shuro inside,” Grandpa Piss said.</p>\n<p>Snotty nodded while still holding his glass full of <em>tuak</em>. The liquor was definitely mixed with something. Considering it was his grandfather who presented it, it was amazing to see Patriarch Shuro Yashura to be able to resist the urge to sleepiness. Snotty stood up and brought the yawning Shuro Yashura away.</p>\n<p>After both of them gone, Yulong picked up a clean glass. He poured the liquor that made Patriarch Shuro sleepy and drank it for himself. Grandpa Piss took out his second bottle and accompanied Yulong drinking <em>tuak</em>.</p>\n<p>“Is there’s something you need to discuss with me?” Yulong asked.</p>\n<p>“Indeed, it’s about Ghalim Malikh’s real condition…” Grandpa Piss didn’t leave any details when he told the Butler Yulong what had really happened in Malikh Family, particularly his discovery about the true nature of poison that made Patriarch Ghalim bedridden.</p>\n<p>When he heard that shocking fact, there was no surprise in the butler’s old face. Only sorrow and regret.</p>\n<p>“I knew this would happened,” Yulong sighed.</p>\n<p>“Then there’s Blackwood Family too…” Grandpa Piss’s sigh followed. “They seems interested in taking away Young Lady Bhela as a bride… I really don’t know what to say…”</p>\n<p>Yulong drank the <em>tuak</em> and told Grandpa Piss his reasoning, “That boy from Blackwood Family still hasn’t accepted Sir Jhuro’s decission to retire sixteen years ago. He’s been keeping quiet because he knew even the royalty and the organization behind him couldn’t protect him from Old Sir Lharu’s and Old Madam Sari’s retrubution. Time’s change. I reckon there’s some change somewhere that make him cocky.”</p>\n<p>“Old Sir and Old Madam too far away to give help in case something like this happens suddenly. Should I help you and Sir Jhuro keeping tabs on Blackwood Family?” Grandpa Piss asked.</p>\n<p>While Jhuro Yashura left behind resources and men outside before he retired, he almost never interacted with the high society of nobility. For ears and eyes to reach those fancy places, it would take time and efforts for current Yulong and Shuro Yashura to do so. It was way better to ask Grandpa Piss who already familiar due to his family’s generations of Alchemist profession. However, Yulong rejected the offer without giving it a real thought.</p>\n<p>“You don’t need to worry. Blackwood Family only taking a ride of that boy’s ambition. If he really supports his foster family right from the start, Blackwood won’t be stuck with their viscount nobility rank.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss wanted to offer any more help, but he long sensed the old butler’s distrust of him on affairs that didn’t include medicines and elixirs. So he kept his mouth shut for the time being.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, a golden owl landed on the veranda where the two old men enjoyed their <em>tuak</em>. The own brought a small piece of paper and inked quill with it.</p>\n<p>“Go, send this message to Sir Jhuro, as fast as possible!” Butler Yulong said to the owl after he wrote his tiny letter. Then he glanced at Grandpa Piss and said, “this is an owl I keep around in case there’s an emergency. Sir Jhuro also brought one with him.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss nodded with a painful smile. This golden owl was long thought to be extinct, but the reality there were small amounts of them were being kept in case of emergencies. They were rare, almost becoming birds of legend. Small to medium sized kingdoms wouldn’t dare to think getting their hands on it, not to mention Grandpa Piss’s own family. But this old butler had one with him. And the prodigial man of Yashura Family casually brought this treasure bird with him to travel around the southern land.</p>\n<p>“This is really for emergency,” Yulong said coldly, knowing full well the old Alchemist’s envy.</p>\n<p>“I know, I know--for emergency.”</p>\n<p>The owl then flew away bringing Yulong’s letter.</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss and Snotty returned back to their own village the next morning. After sending them away, Yulong found out the young master, Shira Yashura, wanted to go to the market to pick some goods for his contracted pedlers to sell. He was worried the young master’s inexperience getting him exploited. Therefore, he waited in the gate and followed the boy from behind.</p>\n<p>In front of an inn owned by Elzhier Family, Yulong saw a familiar eastern Kaya man came out with a respectable, but humble Mossack man behind him. The Kaya man, Sir Kurusiya, noticed Yulong, immediately cupped his fist and bowed his body. That was a salute of great respect eastern Kaya men usually give to people they regard highly. Sir Baront Staterwind didn’t know what was going on, so he imitated his companion to salute Yulong even though he didn’t really know he was only a butler.</p>\n<p>“You know them, Yulong?” Shira asked.</p>\n<p>“The Kaya man once works in the same place as your father, young master.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, that’s why you know him.” Yulong was his mother helper, and his father brought him along to Yashura Family when Shira still in his mother’s belly. Shira never liked to listen about his father’s past, even though it was often glorified since he was completely stopped marauding bandits from approaching Badril Village. Walking toward the market, Shira kept quiet and didn’t ask the matter any further.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Far away from Badril Village, the golden owl Yulong tasked with the emergency letter flew through walls of mist and mountains. It instinctively knew the location of its recipient, Jhuro Yashura, even though Yulong wasn’t necesserarily knew where he was. Not even a half day passed by since the bird took off from Yashura Family, it flew already more than halfway toward its destination.</p>\n<p>Its speed was unprecendeted amongst the magical beast. No wonder commonfolks thought it was the bird of the legend. It was a shame that it failed to detect a single flash on the horizon, resulting it to succumb to a terrible fate.</p>\n<p><em>Flap flap flap!</em></p>\n<p>The owl futilely tried to avoid danger.</p>\n<p>A single flash all it took to capture the dumbfounded owl. A pair of cold talons gripped its short neck and the next thing it knew, the owl panically flapping its wings in search of oxygen, only to be deprived of fresh air even more. The owl couldn’t see the beast, it only saw a dashingly crimson flash before it was captured by the neck. The hostile beast scretched, only after that the owl realized a damned predator eagle already got it. Annoyed by the owl’s desperate struggle, the eagle broke its neck. The handsome crimson-colored eagle then delivered the dead owl to a mysterious masked man, who then passed it to another man--a pale, thin man who only dressed himself as black as the phantom itself.</p>\n<p>“This owl coming out from Yashura Family, Mister Blackwood. The bird brings a letter with it,” the masked man said as he presented the letter to the pale man.</p>\n<p>“Ah, so they figured it out about the poison,” the pale man with Blackwood surname said. Beside him and the masked man, there was a third man who drained the blood of the golden owl, prepared a little feast of its dead body. The man was very peculiar; bald, with veined oversized muscles that looked like it was almost exploded, and the strange tatooes that covered its body. He was a northern barbarian, the kind that never took orders from civilized men no matter they came from the west, south, or the east. Yet, when the Blackwood guy told him top plucking the dead owl, he obidiently put aside the carcass, not daring to show any hints of disatisfaction.</p>\n<p>“Mister, the young lady of Malikh Family turns out to be a four-elemental Unique Class, she’s a real talent with tremendous potential--your sister tries to take her to Blackwood Family and having a setback because there’s some experts happened to visit Malikh Family. Shall we send anymore resources to help her?”</p>\n<p>“What’s her Blackwood Family have to do with me? It’s already good enough I let her to use my name to coerce people and strengthen her influence in commerce world. She’s getting annoying every time she’s using my toys. That Jhuju’s poison I sent to her only a reminder to Ghalim of our old friendship, my sister should be thankful enough if she gets some benefits from it.”</p>\n<p>The masked man knew the pale man was irritated by his sister’s cockiness. So he excused himself and brought the crimson eagle with him, disappearing into the shadow.</p>\n<p>“We’ve rested enough,” the pale man said as he crumbled the small letter he read. The bald barbarian’s head cocked and he await the order. “Prepare the horses,” the man continued, “I’ve got an old friend I should say hi to.”</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-1/chapter-6":"<p>When the news about what happened in Malikh Family’s ngajen ceremony arrived at Blackwood Family, Madam Blackwood was so enraged she broke the tea cup she held onto the floor. Establishing the family’s foot in Badril Village was supposed to be easy, but not only he failed to gain the support of Malikh Family and the villagers, the Young Master of Blackwood Family somehow managed to incite the bedridden patriarch’s supporters to regain their lost foothold against the corrupt Malikh Family’s elders.</p>\n<p>“There’s no point keeping him in that rural village,” Madam Blackwood said. She was a flamboyant, late thirty years old woman whose beauty was so superior that the previous viscount adopt her as a daughter. “Call Frane back to the city, he’s going to spend two months training in capital!”</p>\n<p>The butler who was waiting for her bowed and went away to carry out the task.</p>\n<p>“How’s Lyla’s birthday party going?”</p>\n<p>“Reply to madam, the party has started, the guests who came only from baron nobilities and mid-rank merchants,” a maid replied.</p>\n<p>The madam glanced the timid middle-aged man who sat on the same table as her. She scoffed, saying, “Look how your daughter made a name for herself. Not only the bribe money was wasted away, she coming on trips in the seminars only resulting her made a fool out of herself! Hah, like father, like daughter! Imbecile!”</p>\n<p>Madam Blackwood hurled the new cup that recently poured with hot, scalding tea. She purposely aimed at the table so the hot water splashed on the viscount’s hands. The timid viscount didn’t make a sound when his hands getting burnt, he didn’t dare to fight against his wife. It was already ten years too late for him to retaliate in any way. From the way he dragged his limping leg to fetch damp towel for his scaling skin, it was clear the waiting servants already used to ignore him.</p>\n<p>Recently, his wife’s mood had became the worst ever since their youngest daughter came back from the two years seminars. Unlike Frane--who only registered as his son by blood in papers, Lyla hadn’t show any particular talents in becoming a Class worthy of a noble family. She had a decent progress speed, a Level 7 Novice after seminars, but that progress mainly because she never had the interest to train herself. Madam Blackwood had bribed the officials so Lyla could enter the seminars supposed to boost her standing in high society, so she could catch higher ranking nobles eyes somehow. However, that plan failed in the worst way that could happen to a noble family like the Blackwood. She made blunders and broke rules so many times that she became a laughing stock. The only families that interested in her only lower rank nobles and not-so well off merchant families.</p>\n<p>“There also no point keeping that useless girl forever in the mansion,” Madam Blackwood said. “Send her to Badril Village by tomorrow. Make some smart men tending to her needs--they have to smart enough to know how to reel those Malikh villagers to say yes when I send my words in the future!”</p>\n<p>After the son’s failure, the madam would send her daughter, to do nothing but play around in Malikh Family. Even if there was something the girl could do, the madam surely wouldn’t choose this daughter of hers who she deemed too brainless to do even the simplest tasks. Her daughter was just that useless to her. The one with received the orders were people who accompanied her, who had experience in bribing and coercing. They were tasked to devour Malikh Family from the inside. The Blackwood would surely corner Bhela Malikh this time.</p>\n<p>Somewhere else, in a colorless courtyard, a birthday party already went on for about two hours. Most guests already leaving, not unlike the year before the two-years seminars happened when the sons of noble families dallying around waiting for a chance to talk with the young lady. Today, the Young Lady of Blackwood Family turned fourteen, two years before she would considered mature, but this young miss still pouting her mouth like a little girl.</p>\n<p>The old handmaid saw her young lady was bored and offered a treat.</p>\n<p>“Young lady, try this cake. A certain famous bakery made this just for your birthday.”</p>\n<p>The cake served on a small plate along with a silver fork. The girl took only mere seconds to finish it.</p>\n<p>“Is it good?” the handmaid asked.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t matter if it’s good or not, Aunt Jiji, I still hungry with this tiny minny bit of cake! Let me eat that one!” the girl pointed at the layered cake served on the center of the party.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Lyla, you can’t!”</p>\n<p>“Why can’t I?!”</p>\n<p>“You must present yourself as a proper young lady, so you can’t!”</p>\n<p>The cake was to be portioned to serve for the same amount of guests since the last party, but because the Blackwood Family’s young lady had a bad reputation in the seminars, most invited families didn’t actually come.</p>\n<p>“But I can’t be a lady if I’m hungry, am I?”</p>\n<p>“You must learn the way. Be patient, Young Lady Lyla!”</p>\n<p>“But I am huuungriiiiieeeehhh!!!”</p>\n<p>Aunt Jiji was terrified when she realized the young lady wasn’t referred only to portion of the cake, but she wanted to eat the whole cake. This shorty girl, although her feature was thin with only her cheeks got plump, actually had a talent to be a terrifying glutton that would be seen in Tiramikal Continent every one hundred years. It was a useless talent that brought only shame to Blackwood Family.</p>\n<p>It was fortunate that before the young lady could make a big ruckus, a maidservant came to bring the news about the madam’s decision. Aunt Jiji passed it to the young lady immediately.</p>\n<p>“You heard that, young lady! Madam is going to send you for a vacation!”</p>\n<p>Lyla’s head straightened, she forgot to pout. “Vacation? Where? Where where?”</p>\n<p>“To Badril Village!”</p>\n<p>“Badril Village?” the girl tilted her head. “Where’s that?”</p>\n<p>“If you promise Aunt Jiji not to eat too much cake today, Aunt Jiji will tell you where it is…”</p>\n<p>“I will if it turned out somewhere fun!”</p>\n<p>“Badril Village is where Young Lady Bhela’s home place!”</p>\n<p>“Sis Bhela’s home?!” Lyla gasped, “yahoooo!!!”</p>\n<p>Ignoring that she was the center of attention, Lyla suddenly jumped and danced like no tomorrow. Aunt Jiji tried to stop her, but it was futile since Lyla only promised not to be glutton. The remaining guests began whispering with each other. They were people who doubted the rumors about this Young Lady Blackwood, but after seeing how childish and ridiculous the girl danced, people were finally convinced. How was this a viscount’s daughter supposed to act? The girl danced her hips and hopped around like a bunny that had an itchy bum. Soon, the Young Lady Lyla Blackwood fell to the bottom list of desired young ladies to marry. Her reputation fell from not-so-smart, to stupid, and then fell again to brainless and imbecile. People didn’t see her in a good light. But that just how a girl named Lyla Blackwood really was.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Yashura Family got a peculiar visitor these past two days. He introduced himself as an expert from overseas, and somehow this foreign expert became interested in Shira Yashura. When the story leaked by insiders from Yashura Family, people were scratching their heads, wondering what could an educated man saw from this trash who could only get himself to level 3 Novice. Some people even sneered, saying that whole news was just Yashura Family’s little trick to clear up rumors from their heir’s name.</p>\n<p>“You understand, kiddo? There are three mandatory rules if someone wants to meet privately with me. First rule, it’s a <em>she</em>, not <em>he</em>. Second rule, big boobs. Third rule, in her lower part, there must be big bubbly butts, as big as her boobs. <em>Anything</em> lesser than that you can just send them back to wherever they came from.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit said that as he moved his chess piece, eating one of Shira’s pawns.</p>\n<p>“And remember, my standard is pretty high. Consult with how loadful those girls from Big-Boobed Sect are for more information,” the Nalaq continued.</p>\n<p>“Please don’t talk nonsense. I’m being serious here,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“Ey, I’m not talking nonsense. The girls from Big-Boobed Sect are real deal, okay? They’re huge! If you don’t believe me then you should go to Elzhier Family one of these days, go check out how glorious their boobs are. They always dance or become the maidservants when they’re not on duties.”</p>\n<p>“Ol’ Good-Natured Spirit… I don’t want to hear this imaginary all-woman sect of yours. Elzhier Family is only a normal rural family, they don’t host any sect members within their walls. If they did, the Village Head would boast about it at my uncle’s face every single day.”</p>\n<p>“You just don’t believe it because you never see how great they are--their boobs, I mean. How great those melons inside tight suits are! Just think about it; leather suits and melons--two entirely different things but if they come together they’d jiggling in harmony. This Good-Natured Spirit approved their sense of style.”</p>\n<p>“Forget about it, it’s not important--”</p>\n<p>“Boobs are important, ey!”</p>\n<p>Shira waved his hand as he didn’t want to continue this nonsense. He then moved a piece and finished his turn. He returned the topic back again, “The expert said he came from a first-tier faction called Blue Robe Society. If we can get his faction’s recognition then at least my family can silence all those rumors about me--especially the recent ones, they really are becoming a pain in the ass.”</p>\n<p>“I told you. I don’t talk with guys. No boobs, no good. Period.”</p>\n<p>“You are really becoming a pain in the ass,” Shira complained.</p>\n<p>After Shira said that, Good-Natured Spirit’s knight jumped over a wall of pawns to get on his bishop. Within a single breath Shira immediately moved his rook, creating a chain reaction that exposes the Nalaq’s defence, resulting his king trapped in three different direction.</p>\n<p>“Check mate.”</p>\n<p>“Ey, what the fu--” Good-Natured Spirit rage quit, flipping the chess board. “Hah! I knew it! You brat, you intentionally make me talk about boobs in order to lower my guard, right?! Fuck! That is how it is, isn’t it?!”</p>\n<p>“No, it is not.”</p>\n<p>“You sneaky bastard. You really got me,” Good-Natured Spirit threw his hands up in the air. <br>\n“Man, I surrender, that is some sick psychological tactic you got there.”</p>\n<p>“Now I don’t really know what you’re talking about.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit waved his hands in surrender, then he lit a cigarette. “Anyway, what do you want from me this time? Money again? I prepared some kobe coins enough for you to buy some candy, here, take this.”</p>\n<p>Shira shoved back the coin bag. “Not today. I just want you to meet Sir Baront Staterwind.”</p>\n<p>“No boobs, no good. Ask something else. How about I tell you the secret place where are those Big-Boobed Sect girls take their bath, ‘ey? Seems fair deal to me.”</p>\n<p>“How many times do I have to tell you--”</p>\n<p>“Sssshhh!!” Good-Natured Spirit hushed the boy. He then whispered, “you hear that?”</p>\n<p>Because the Nalaq suddenly became vigilant, Shira instinctively lowered his voice too. “Hear what?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“I heard some rats watching us…” the Nalaq covered his mouth, as if he didn’t want people to read lips what he said next, “some big-boobed rats…”</p>\n<p>“Huh… what?”</p>\n<p>“The girls from Big-Boobed Sect… they’re here…”</p>\n<p>“The heck are you talking about? This hill is Yashura Family’s property--”</p>\n<p>“Sssshhhh! They’ve noticed me noticing them. Wait here, I’mma get you some melons for your reward!”</p>\n<p>After he saying that, Good-Natured Spirit’s figure melting into the thin air.</p>\n<p>Shira Yashura sighed. At times, asking favor to this vulgar Nalaq not only difficult, it also unpredictable he’d only incite troubles if he not careful.</p>\n<p>After his winning streak for more than half a year maybe he became cocky. He forgot the Nalaq wasn’t there to solve his problem whenever he wanted, although the Nalaq sort of ended up like that after a few months he came here. Shira got some thinking, maybe he should stop seeing this Nalaq as his convenient piggy bank for his own good.</p>\n<p>“Really, he always making a mess for me to clean. I wonder if such thoughtless Nalaqs like him are common around here… now, where’s the last piece again?” he sighed for the second time.</p>\n<p>When he was picking up chess pieces that board Good-Natured Spirit flipped earlier, Shira realized there was a missing piece. Turned out it was stuck in the hole between tree roots.</p>\n<p>He plunged his hand to look for the missing chess piece.</p>\n<p>“Ugh… my fingers can’t reach.”</p>\n<p>He tried to squirm his body to fit his hand in.</p>\n<p>“Where is it again?”</p>\n<p>He frowned. He squirmed his body again really hard.</p>\n<p>“Oh, there it--”</p>\n<p><em>BOOOOOMMMMM!!!!</em></p>\n<p>An explosion happened not far away from the place he used to hang out, creating a wave of rolling dust that swept over the hill. Shira got his hand stuck between the tree rots, he could only hugged his head with his free hand and waited for the shockwave to finish. The chess pieces he gathered already nowhere to be found. He cooked up his head, looking left and right, and saw the greeny grasses were covered with dirts and trees were uprooted. The whole hill became a shithole kind of mess.</p>\n<p>Before the boy could swallow what was going on, a chuckle could be heard near him. Before him, Good-Natured Spirit emerged, coiling around the Nalaq’s body were purple-colored living flames that hungrily tried to eat him whole.</p>\n<p>As carefree as he usually was, Good-Natured Spirit said with a grin, “Those Big-Boobed Sect girls sure are feisty. They’re escaping too fast, I can’t get you melons. I managed to get a feeling of their butts, though. Here, there’s some fragrant left behind.”</p>\n<p>Shira stepped back when the Nalaq offered his palm. It was still on fire, the boy didn’t want to get burn along with him. Besides, he didn’t want to get involved with the Nalaq’s deprived hobby.</p>\n<p>“Sure you don’t want it?” Good-Natured Spirit took a last sniff from his palm, followed by a low chuckle of his.</p>\n<p>“Good-Natured Spirit… what’s that fire?”</p>\n<p>“Yeah? Dunno, man. Exorcism flame or something.”</p>\n<p>“Ohh… oh, it’s very nice to know you up until know. Good bye.”</p>\n<p>“Hmm? You want to go somewhere?” Realizing the purple flame was getting annoying, Good-Natured Spirit then patted away the coiling flame from his shoulders like it was nothing.</p>\n<p>Shira shrugged his shoulders. It seemed this bastard Nalaq was too tough for that exorcism flame. Maybe the flame was too ordinary? Whatever, he didn’t care about that anymore. His eyes then swept the ruin around him. He said, “You can’t forget about the meeting for today. But please clean the mess you made yourself.”</p>\n<p>“That’s what you want for the chess reward?”</p>\n<p>Shira nodded.</p>\n<p>“Aye, aye, will do.” Good-Natured Spirit flicked his fingers, and human-sized paper cranes came out of thin air. They were obedient, not clear whether were monsters or just magical devices. The paper cranes used magnet-like magic to carry the messy uprooted trees and boulders, along with sweeping the dirt from the grass. The cleaning up might take a while, since the hill really was a mess. Shira, feeling a little light on the head, facepalming as he returned back to Yashura Family.</p>\n<p>The whole explosion could be heard from all over Badril Village. It wasn’t clear what its cause, but Yashura Family sent guards to prevent people from knowing what really happened. In Yashura Family’s guest hall, Patriarch Shuro Yashura, a few good Yashura Family elders, and the respected visitor, Sir Baront Staterwind, forming a circle as they sat cross-legged, discussing the explosion that had just occurred.</p>\n<p>“Good elders, Sir Patriarch Yashura, I know you must get excited when I said Young Master Shira has some talent in communicating with Nalaqs. However, a Nalaq still a Nalaq. You must not offend a Nalaq whatsoever, or the consequence is dire! Young Master Shira’s life is way more important than getting a qualification to enter my school!” Sir Baront Staterwind warned. His forehead was still wet with sweat, since he hurriedly ran to Yashura Family when he realized the direction of recent explosion.</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, you’re right, Sir Staterwind. Absolutely right! I already sent someone to check on my nephew’s condition, please calm down,” Patriarch Shuro said.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront shook his head. “You don’t really know what I’m trying to say, do you? You should prepare a very good healer or a doctor, Patriarch Shuro, because if it isn’t death, one can easily lose a limb over angering a Nalaq! That happens more often than you think!”</p>\n<p>The elders drew cold breaths in unison when they heard that. Patriarch Shuro, whose face already pale, becoming even whiter than a sheet of paper. If they boy lost a limb, Shira’s chance to succeed him as the next patriarch could be swept away like specks of dust.</p>\n<p>Yulong the Butler arrived. Everyone in the room had been anxiously waiting for him they instinctively stood up when Yulong approached.</p>\n<p>“Yulong, how’s Shira doing?” Patriarch Shuro asked.</p>\n<p>Yulong replied, “Young Master Shira is back, patriarch. But Madam Yashura sent him to the kitchen for a second breakfast.”</p>\n<p>“Breakfast? What’s a breakfast has something to do with that explosion? Can he still walk?”</p>\n<p>“He’s walking fine, Patriarch Yashura.”</p>\n<p>“Then, Yulong, please go fetch my nephew for me, we have something urgent to tell him!”</p>\n<p>After his trained elegant bow, Yulong stepped back and proceeded to do the task given to him.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront Staterwind peered at the butler’s back. He traveled southern lands many times, visiting many villages, yet, he seldom heard a Mossack descent major family employed western-style butler. What made him confused even more that Sir Kurusiya apparently knew the butler and gave his respect to him, which Sir Baront Staterwind didn’t expect that coming from the cold eastern Kaya swordsman.</p>\n<p>“Dear good elder,” Sir Baront Staterwind asked a random elder who sat beside him, “may I know why there’s a butler working here?”</p>\n<p>“Is Sir referring to Yulong? Yulong isn’t actually working for Yashura Family, but Young Master Shira’s mother’s attendant. I can’t tell you the details, so forgive me sir, all I can say is Young Master Shira’s father is exceedingly brave and awesome he managed to woo a respectable lady many years ago.”</p>\n<p>“Ahhh…” Sir Baront nodded. The boy apparently a result of his parent eloping. The Blue Robe Society expert of course knew etiquette to hold himself from digging the story further.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, Yulong came back with Shira followed behind. The boy wore new clothes since his previous one was dirty. When he saw the group of elders and the expert guest looking at him, Shira sighed inside his heart. He knew he had to clean Good-Natured Spirit’s mess once again.</p>\n<p>“Greetings, elders… greetings, uncle patriarch… greetings, Sir Staterwind…”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro impatiently treading forward. “Shira my boy, is it true that you lost your limbs?”</p>\n<p>“I’m unhurt, uncle, see?” Shira waved both of his hands to prove that his limbs still functioned as they should be.</p>\n<p>“Oh! God, thank God! Really! These are really your hands, aren’t they? Not a fake one made with wood?” Patriarch Shuro Yashura grabbed his nephew hands and waved it around like a child playing with flags.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira,” Sir Baront opened his mouth, “I reckon you failed to ask the Nalaq to meet me? If you can’t do it, young master, it best for you not to push him any further. Today, you offend him and he blast the hill behind your Yashura Family as a warning, but what happens if you make the same mistake tomorrow?”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro nodded at his words vigorously. “Sir Baront is right, Shira my boy. A Nalaq is a revered being ancient Mossacks worshiped as their guardian angel. The consequence of making them mad is very dire! You should know better, my boy, you should’ve told your uncle if a Nalaq came to you the first time!”</p>\n<p>Sir Baront and his uncle Patriarch Shuro had good intentions in telling him about how to be respectful to a Nalaq. But the more Shira heard their warning, the more he doubted about Good-Natured Spirit being a “revered” Nalaq like they said. Of course, saying the truth about the explosion’s true cause resulting only Yashura Family losing face in front of Sir Baront Staterwind. Shira had no choice, he had to tread the matter very carefully.</p>\n<p>“<em>Cough, cough</em>… Uncle, Sir Baront, thank you for your concern. Truth is, it wasn’t that the Nalaq being mad that causes the explosion, but there was some… accident… that happened right before.”</p>\n<p>“With what title do you usually call him, Young Master Shira?” Sir Baront asked.</p>\n<p>“As far as I know, he doesn’t have a title. At least he didn’t tell me if he ever had one. He told me to call him ‘Good-Natured Spirit’.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, with that kind of nickname, he must be a very benevolent person when he was alive,” Sir Baront concluded as he rubbed his beard. “So, Young Master Shira, it seems he didn’t really intent to blast into smithereens.”</p>\n<p>Shira nodded. That part was true. Instead, someone else happened to be intending to blast this Nalaq into smithereens.</p>\n<p>“Thank God! Thank God! If he is a good Nalaq, maybe we don’t need to throw the second ngajen ceremony for this month, after all!” Patriarch Shuro Yashura exclaimed. The elders in the guest hall followed his exclaiming by handclapping and joyful cries. Ngajen ceremony only held once a month so the village safe from angry Selaqs, no one ever tried it to protect themselves from intelligent Nalaqs. Since the village was founded, the locals never had a Nalaq dwelling there. So it was natural for the elders to worry about throwing a ceremony they didn’t know working or not. Ngajen ceremony was expensive, after all.</p>\n<p>The more Shira saw how the previous tense hall turned jubilant and full of relieved faces, the more awkward he became. That Nalaq might call himself ‘Good-Natured Spirit’, yet he was anything but good. A low-life spirit who no doubt had been using the invisibility traits of spirits to commit many deprived crimes. He was closer to evil spirit incarnation than a good-natured one. The misunderstanding was too great his face twisted as if he’d just taste a sour lemon.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront Staterwind said, “Still, since he seems reluctant to use his old name, I reckon the Nalaq that approaching you is a low-tier one, Young Master Shira. Low-tier Nalaqs usually spirits that gain consciousness merely by luck. They don’t have factions backing them, and fortunately--in my experience--it easier to initiate negotiation with unaffiliated Nalaqs.” A hint of pride then flashed through his eyes, he continued, “my disciples will arrive tomorrow morning. One of them contracted with a high-tier Nalaq. Since the Nalaq’s mood turned sour is partly my fault, with help from the Nalaq contracted with one of my disciples, I will ask him to leave Yashura Family peacefully!”</p>\n<p>“Sir Staterwind is wise! Thank you for your concern, Sir!” Patriarch Shuro sang praises toward this expert. The elders of Yashura Family followed suit.</p>\n<p>“As expected of such expert!”</p>\n<p>“Sir Staterwind is the best of bunch of all experts that I know all my life!”</p>\n<p>“Hurray for Sir Staterwind!”</p>\n<p>They circling Sir Baront Staterwind and, not long after that, someone started to prostate. They behaved as if the guest was their one and only savior. Even Shira was getting embarrassed from seeing the scene, not to mention the already flushing Baront Staterwind.</p>\n<p>When everyone getting carried away, Shira slipped out after excusing himself. He knew he was no match for the Yashura Family’s older generations’ shamelessness. Upon walking outside, he saw Yulong was standing by the hall’s door looking galant as usual with his butler professionalism.</p>\n<p>“Can you please try to stop my uncle, Yulong? Sir Staterwind is started to get uncomfortable there.”</p>\n<p>Yulong glanced at the whole mess inside, and then he said to his young master, “I think it’s not everyday an expert coming to Yashura Family, young master, so let’s count this as Patriarch Yashura to gaining favors from a foreign expert.”</p>\n<p>“Are they really okay, though?”</p>\n<p>Yulong smiled.</p>\n<p>“Of course they aren’t, young master. But Patriarch Shuro and the family elders are honest people. Although sometimes they can be overwhelming, I’m sure Sir Staterwind can see no falsehood in their words.”</p>\n<p>Shira looked at those elders inside once again. The more he saw, the more he realized that those hysterical village men calling a man they barely knew these past two days a savior by no means a lie from their part. The elders really were freaking out when they heard the explosion. And Patriarch Shuro Yashura was the most worried of the bunch, considering him a patriarch and an uncle. Thinking about it all again, Shira couldn’t really say he still embarrassed seeing the elders spewing exaggerated flattering with straight faces.</p>\n<p>“Sir Staterwind comes from a respectable sect. Someone like that won’t get to travel the southern lands if he didn’t know the nature of the local people. So it best not to worry about it too much, young master,” Yulong said.</p>\n<p>“Really… ah, speaking of sects,” Shira deliberately changed the topic, “I heard from someone that one of the major families in Badril Village hosts members of a certain sect in secret. You’re from outside, Yulong--do you think something so outrageous like that could happen?”</p>\n<p>“Some older sects have long reaching influence, but I don’t think anyone would be interested to plant their own in Badril Village. There’s nothing valuable here for them to take notice.”</p>\n<p>“As I thought. It’s just unthinkable to think some secret powers lurking beneath our everyday lives. What if some experts actually pretending to be servants here in Yashura Family?”</p>\n<p>Although it wasn’t noticeable, Yulong’s smile became stiff.</p>\n<p>“You jest, young master. If that was true, do you think your uncle and the elders can take that kind of truth?”</p>\n<p>Following Yulong’s gaze, Shira peeped the hall and saw Sir Baront’s awkward figure, where he was in the center of Yashura Family elites--all of them-- who passionately prostrating in the floor. They practically worshipping him now.</p>\n<p>“You’re right…” Shira could only hide his face with his palm. Just when he thought he could understand them, the boy then wished he didn’t know these shameless men.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>As far as the current generation of Badril Village locals knew, they never got visited by nobles until this month Malikh Family’s ngajen ceremony happened. Everyone still talking about it.</p>\n<p>Young Master of Blackwood Family only stayed in Badril Village in one day. And the noble carriage of Blackwood Family set off out of Badril Village by noon. The next morning after the day he was gone, the two foreign guests who had been staying in Malikh Family, Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia, felt overstaying might be unnecessary, thus decided to leave too.</p>\n<p>Because the carriages going out from Badril Village mostly for public transports, Bhela personally asked an elder from his father’s faction who had a horse carriage to give her guests a ride to the nearest town, where they’d later book a private carriage for them to return home. Mister Harrington, as an unsocial bachelor as he always was, was waiting in the carriage for Madame Sylvia to say her parting words to Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>“You have a very bright future, Young Lady Bhela. A girl with limitless potential. So your favor will become very valuable as you mature,” Madame Sylvia said. “If you need something, you can always send letters to my sect. Don’t hold back. Just think about this of us making an investment.”</p>\n<p>Since Bhela a smart girl anyway, Madame Sylvia decided not to make her words fancy and told her in a straightforward manner. Bhela appreciated her honesty, and said her thanks.</p>\n<p>The carriage then set off. In the main gate of Badril Village, the guards on duty witnessed the recently blazing popular Young Lady Bhela Malikh bowing her body as she sent off two foreigners in traveling clothes made from expensive linen.</p>\n<p>“Look at how she is,” inside the carriage, Madame Sylvia said to Mister Harrington. “She’s a pretty sensible girl, don’t you think?”</p>\n<p>“She is,” Mister Harrington said softly, almost a murmur.</p>\n<p>It was hard to start a conversation whenever Mister Harrington sat with his arms crossed tightly. Madame Sylvia could see that he wasn’t exactly happy with the outcome regarding Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>There was no bandits lurking around, and no monsters occasionally came out, proved that the lands around Badril Village actually well-protected--too well, perhaps, for a rural village without a major power backing them. Their journey was smooth without disturbance. Thirty minutes after they left Badril Village, they encountered another carriage painted with black-jet color. The black carriage was well-decorated with golden-colored plates, obviously elites or nobles were traveling inside.</p>\n<p>However, unlike common nobles who liked to hide in the carriage to show-off their elegance and aloofness, this carriage simply out of commonsense. To talk about how weird this carriage was there was a need to point out the refreshing greenness of the view around. Despite there being a road far away from settlement, hint of liveliness from bird chirping--along with croaking frogs from nearby streams and singing insects--completed the idyllic road with a strange harmony that invited light-hearted person to sing along with lively nature. That was exactly what the noble in the black carriage doing. A young lady with a very girly and childish feature was carefreely sitting in the window in spite of pale servants begging her to sit still. She completely dumb about the servants’ pleas. And with her personality, nobody knew whether she was pretending or not. The only thing that the jubilant Lyla Blackwood cared about was singing an off-tune song about her befriending village frogs and bunnies.</p>\n<p>“Prepare your life you frogs and bunnies~</p>\n<p>Cause I’m not letting you go before we become the best of buddies~~</p>\n<p>Wait for me you birdies and kitties~~</p>\n<p>Cause we’re about to become the best of all buddies~~ yuhuu~ yuhuu~~</p>\n<p>The best buddies in this lifetime~~ yuhuuuu~~~”</p>\n<p>There was nothing the servants and the guards could do to stop their young lady from singing this amazingly ugly song about her future exploits in Badril Village. Seeing that another carriage approaching, the horse-riding guards did their best to block the view to the crest planted on the carriage’s compartment. Their effort to save faces from the young lady’s mishap was futile, however, since the other party happened to know Lyla.</p>\n<p>“How many times have I told you to stay away from windows, Lyla!”</p>\n<p>“Whu--what? Who?” Lyla was surprised. But then she was elated to see a familiar face. “Is that you, Instructor Sylvia? You here to train Sis Bhela’s archery again?”</p>\n<p>“Get down from the window!” Madame Sylvia raised her voice.</p>\n<p>“I’m also here to meet Sis Bhela!” Lyla also raised her voice cheerfully.</p>\n<p>“Lyla, you won’t be able to get married in the future if you’re always act like this!” Madame Sylvia warned her. She long dropped title of Young Lady Blackwood when talking to this naughty girl.</p>\n<p>“Um!” Lyla nodded. “But which one do you like more, Instructor Sylvia, bunnies or kitties?” It was no use trying to talk sense to Lyla. Any warning only come to her right ear and gone out straight from the left one.</p>\n<p>“Stay away from the windows!!!” Madame Sylvia screamed until her voice shrilled.</p>\n<p>Lyla also screamed, “Good morning to you too!!!”</p>\n<p>Both carriages drifted apart after the brief encounter. It ended with Lyla happily waved her hands happily. Madame Sylvia sighed and shook her head. That girl was so naughty that the troubles she created made the seminars’ managements even considered to drop her once during the seminars. Only after Bhela Malikh convinced them she’d take care of Lyla they finally did let go the matter.</p>\n<p>Before, the black carriage of Blackwood Family came to Badril Village in the shroud of night’s darkness, so nobody noticed their elegance and the aura of expensive carriage blazing through the village road--of which was surprisingly wide for a settlement road, unlike road of cities in the western kingdoms, because long ago Mossack people needed to endure monster stampedes passing through their villages once every few months.</p>\n<p>“Mom, look, is that a noble?” a snotty kid pointing out the carriage.</p>\n<p>The mother hurriedly pulled her child. “Ssuuussh! Keep your finger to yourself! Don’t you know what happened to peasants that make noble angry from the stories they always talking about?”</p>\n<p>The steel-armored guards who escort the carriage scoffed them in disdain. Contrast with the escorts’ attitudes, Lyla waved her hand at them, while shouting, “Hey boy, don’t you think bunnies are cute as the kitties? Or do you like cats more?”</p>\n<p>The kid didn’t answer. He instead forced to bow by her mother and let the carriage went through silently. The villagers didn’t have the experience in receiving nobles, most of them--except for those who attended the ngajen ceremony in Malikh Family--had never saw nobles in their lives. Because of that they were awkward and didn’t know what to do.</p>\n<p>Lyla didn’t seem to mind their stiffness. Instead, she vigorously greeted everyone she saw from the window she sat on.</p>\n<p>“Good day! Good morning! I’m here to sleepover at Sis Bhela’s place! Do you know where Sis Bhela lives?”</p>\n<p>Back in Elzhier Family, in the main family’s house, their patriarch, hurriedly changed his clothes to a formal one he always used every ngajen ceremony.</p>\n<p>“Hurry, hurry! As the head of this village, how can I let a noble arriving without me receiving them?!”</p>\n<p>Not even he yet buttoned his shirt properly, the Village Head sprinted toward the main street, only to see the crowd of onlookers already dispersed and still talking about the scary nobles they always heard in stories were actually <em>weirdly</em> friendly.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Bhela Malikh was already notified about Lyla Blackwood’s arrival. She waited on a chair at the Malikh Family’s gate, drinking a fresh young coconut water occasionally. The black carriage finally was in her view. And the young girl she was waiting for happily waved her hand at her. From the window.</p>\n<p>“Carefull, Lyla!” Bhela yelled as she sprang from her chair.</p>\n<p>“Huuupp!” Lyla Blackwood simply didn’t want to waste anytime leaving the carriage through the door. So she simply jumped from the window she sat upon, before the carriage even stopped. It was fortunate that amongst Bhela’s skill as a Unique Class, she had <b>Haste</b>, which boosted her speed in short duration. She used that to catch Lyla before she hurt herself. The young noble girl landed splendidly in Bhela’s arm.</p>\n<p>“What’s this, Sistah?” Lyla’s eyes sparkled when she saw Bhela get a young coconut in her other hand. She was completely oblivious she just did something dangerous.</p>\n<p>“Young coconut. There’s still some of its water left. Here, try this,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“For me? Really?”</p>\n<p>“Drink slowly…”</p>\n<p><em>Glug glug glug</em>. Lyla drank the coconut in anything but in slowly manner. She even burped shamelessly.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Lyla, ah!” the butler who coming with her was in horror seeing how Young Lady Lyla Blackwood made a horrible mess by spilling the coconut water on her expensive, silk woven black dress. Only an equally expensive silk handkerchief worthy enough to wipe his young lady’s noble dress!</p>\n<p>“I told you to drink slowly…” Bhela said. She used her sleeve to wipe Lyla’s wet face, and then proceeded to also wipe Lyla’s dress.</p>\n<p>“Y-young miss!” the butler shouted in panic. His body jolted as soon as he saw the outrageous act of spoiling the young noble’s dress by making it contacted with commoner clothes. That was heresy! He needed her to stop before she contained Blackwood’s expensive dress with her commoner’s bacteria!</p>\n<p>“You need something?” Bhela looked at this unfamiliar butler of Blackwood Family. Her expressionless face judged the butler coldly.</p>\n<p>“My name is Tim, young miss--please use this!” the butler offered a silky smooth handkerchief with Blackwood Family’s crest embroidered on the surface. The handkerchief was actually the butler’s, was awarded to his great-great-great grandfather by the then Baron Blackwood for some sort of achievement that practically nobody was still alive to remember. Everytime Butler Tim met a new person, he’d make an excuse to show off this particular handkerchief. Today was no exception. It was his most precious handkerchief. Just from the look of it one could tell how crazy expensive it was.</p>\n<p>“Ah, ah… my nose… aahhh--” Lyla felt her nose was wet and itchy, “--ahhtchii!!!”</p>\n<p>“You’ve got a flu?” Bhela asked worriedly.</p>\n<p>“Yeah. Aunt Jiji told me to drink my medicine everyday but it’s so bitter. So much bitter that it’s evil!”</p>\n<p>“Where’s your medicine now?”</p>\n<p>“Oh. I throw it away last night.”</p>\n<p>Bhela shook her head.</p>\n<p>“That’s no good. You can’t throw away your medicine like that. Now, wipe your nose. This mister butler said to use this…” she put the handkerchief on Lyla’s nose, and Lyla blew her nose on it.</p>\n<p>Lyla gave back the handkerchief to Butler Tim. “Thank you, Sir Butler. It’s very helpful of you.”</p>\n<p>The butler received back his most precious handkerchief. Bonus Lyla’s snot.</p>\n<p>“Come on inside,” Bhela said to Lyla. “Even if the water runs dry, coconuts still have meat we can scoop. After that we’ll pick some star fruits that I planted since I was a child.”</p>\n<p>“Star fruits! Woohooo!”</p>\n<p>The girls then walked inside. Lyla was so excited she didn’t leave her friend, hanging on her neck like a koala being comfortable on a tree branch. The stories about a noble young lady coming to Malikh Family for Bhela Malikh spread amongst the maidservants like oil being poured on an open wildfire. The Malikhs couldn’t describe the pride seeing their eldest young lady with a blue blood friend. Especially the aunties. They watched how close Bhela and Lyla with teary eyes and happy smiles.</p>\n<p>“Young lady is… finally… finally…”</p>\n<p>“She finally has a friend…”</p>\n<p>“Huuu… huuu… merciful Goddesses finally saw the young lady’s plight and blessed her with a real friend… huuu huuuu….”</p>\n<p>Nobody more happier than the aunties who were familiar with how their Young Lady Bhela lived her live. They silently cried watching their young lady, who usually alone and unapproachable, finally grown up and had her first friend in these past ten years.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Butler Tim grimaced inside. Despite the fact that he was tasked to win over Bhela Malikh with any means necessary, he didn’t like this girl. It wasn’t because his handkerchief got dirty--well, maybe he resented her for it a little--it because the girl named Bhela Malikh wasn’t acting as a young country girl supposed to act. Country bumpkins supposed to falter when they saw the radiance seeped out of the nobles’ aura, they supposed to tremble when they saw the noble wealth glittering beneath the sun. But this girl was indifferent and aloof. She was cold but the coldness paired with concise and elegant mannerism. Butler Tim knew she trying to act noble herself. That was why he didn’t like her.</p>\n<p>However, Butler Tim was a smart person. Any smart person would wear a perfect smile despite his heart bleeding over the snot on his precious handkerchief. Before leaving the city, the butler didn’t forget to look for a gift he’d use to lower the Malikh Family’s guard. He heard the previous gift was rejected, and when he asked for the content of the gift, the smart Butler Tim shook his head as if he knew it would happen.</p>\n<p>Toward country bumpkins, too expensive gifts would never work. He knew this because he was smart. And because he was smart, he knew better gifts. Not-so-expensive gifts worked for country bumpkins.</p>\n<p>Therefore, he presented Bhela Malikh with popular city biscuits.</p>\n<p>“I heard this biscuit is currently very popular among noble young ladies. This butler happened to pass by a store that sold this, so I reckon Young Lady Bhela might love to taste some.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, because the elders roughly knew the Blackwood Family’s youngest lady would come to visit, two leaders of opposing factions came to watch how their Young Lady Bhela would receive the noble guest. Elder Jhamil was all smiling because he liked what he saw. But the expression of Elder Khasim turned sour when he saw how the butler of Blackwood Family tried to butter up to Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>“Don’t accept it, young lady, please….” Elder Khasim whispered under his breath. Of course, there was no single soul heard what he just said. He was worried the hard work to rebuild his faction’s morale all would turn into dust if people thought their spiritual mascot, the one and only Young Lady Bhela Malikh, could be bought with mere biscuits.</p>\n<p>Contrary to what Elder Khasim hoped, Bhela Malikh received the gift without even putting a second thought. A feeling of defeat surged inside him. Elder Jhamil looked at his rival with a mocking glance.</p>\n<p>After receiving the snacks, Bhela excused herself and brought Lyla with her to stroll around Malikh Family’s gardens. Butler Tim pretended to wave his hand and smiled, but inside, he was gloating at how hypocrite Bhela was. His guess that Young Lady Bhela wouldn’t refuse the gift he brought was entirely correct. Before, he deliberately said the biscuit was noble young ladies’ favorite. Thus, according to his smart logic, as long as it wasn’t too expensive that it’d scare this fake young lady, no way a noble wannabe would reject this kind of gifts.</p>\n<p>“Heh,” Butler Tim scoffed when Bhela and Lyla already left. “Bet you’ve never eaten any city biscuits your entire life, haven’t you.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, Bhela Malikh hadn’t had any city biscuits her entire life. Not before and also not today. What Butler Tim didn’t know was that the snacks he bought with his own money ultimately ended up returned to Blackwood Family--to be exact, it ended up inside Lyla Blackwood’s belly. Bhela couldn’t help but received the biscuits when, beside her, she saw Lyla was drooling looking at the biscuits.</p>\n<p>The elders led by Elder Jhamil then respectfully welcomed the butler along with servants and guards from Blackwood Family. From the impression alone, Butler Tim could see reasons for him to like this slick-tongued Elder Jhamil. He knew how to flatter and also he knew how to act humble in front of people with higher status than him. Not like that noble-wannabe Young Lady of Malikh Family. This Elder Jhamil knew that he was only a country bumpkin thus acted accordingly. Naturally, the smart Butler Tim was pleased.</p>\n<p>And so began Butler Tim’s quests to swallow Malikh Family with his smartly planned schemes and cunning political games.</p>\n<p>In mere hours, the neutral elders who hadn’t joined either both rivalling factions began flocking to Elder Jhamil’s side. One part because they wanted to side with the faction that had the noble support and another part simply because Elder Jhamil, with the help of Butler Tim, had been throwing around sweet deals over all directions.</p>\n<p>“Only one tenth of the elder council members don’t want to pick a side by now, but their number is too significant to be an obstacle for Sir Butler’s great plan,” Elder Jhamil reported the current situation to Butler Tim.</p>\n<p>The butler was enjoying a glass of tea served by the maid that supposed to serve Young Lady Lyla Blackwood as if he was the visiting noble himself. He nodded. “I see. With this, the first stage of my plan has been completed.”</p>\n<p>“Oohhh!” Elder Jhamil exclaimed. “Sir Butler summoned rain and fire by flipping Malikh Family’s political scene upside down, and this is only the first stage?! As expected, the Butler of Blackwood Family is very smart!”</p>\n<p>Butler Tim originally wanted to act aloof and sophisticated before he visited this rural village. However, upon being called a smart person, he couldn’t help but grinned widely. “Oho, you’re an interesting fella, aren’t you? Very well, since you’ve done a good job yourself, I won’t be so petty to grab all the credit. Tell me how I should do next, if I like what I hear, we might as well corporate your thoughts into my plan.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was excited. How could he not? An opportunity to rise beyond a mere elder of rural village was laid before him.</p>\n<p>“Sir Butler, you may not know this, but we Mossack people regard having a good meal very highly. Everytime we’re having breakfast or dinner together as the entire family, even though we’re always looked peaceful outside, those trivial events actually are a political battlefield for us elders to extend our influence! This lowly man himself used a few move in the past during breakfast to gather like-minded men under my banner. I used all my resources and connections in a single mealtime to attack my rivals! However, these past two days, my biggest rival used a lowly method against me…”</p>\n<p>“Oh? What did he do?” Butler Tim asked.</p>\n<p>“He didn’t do much,” Elder Jhamil said, sneering when he was talking about this rival of his, “all he did was inviting Young Lady Bhela everytime we were having a meal in the family hall. He’s been a stubborn and ignorant supporter of main family, but this time he actually knew how to use his connection with the main family to deal a blow against me. A few of the elders had been faltering when they saw Young Lady Bhela leaning over the other side; I’m afraid if we’re leaving this ignorant rival of me doing as he wanted, there’s gonna be a hole in Sir Butler’s smart plan!”</p>\n<p>Butler Tim swirled the tea in his cup as though he was deep in thought. Of course, if this proven to endanger his smart plan, the butler couldn’t sit still watching all that happened. “I heard the Mossacks are peculiar people, but I don’t know you Mossack people have a strange custom!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, we’re living here far away from the city, so of course our traditions might seem unsophisticated to wise westerners like Sir Butler,” Elder Jhamil fawned.</p>\n<p>“Then what do you suggest Blackwood Family should do in this situation, Elder Jhamil?”</p>\n<p>“It’s easy!” Elder Jhamil was so excited he almost jumped from his seat. “My rival faction used Young Lady Bhela to gain foothold, and we can also use that to deal a greater blow back to them!”</p>\n<p>“And that is?”</p>\n<p>“Of course, we can use--I mean, we can invite young noble miss to a dinner together with us. With this we can unofficially announce our alliance with Blackwood Family! It’s the final nail to main family’s faction!”</p>\n<p>Even though Bhela Malikh’s status as a Unique Class shone throughout all of Badril Village, her name still fall short with a pure noble like Lyla Blackwood. Madam back in Blackwood Family used her daughter so Blackwood could infiltrate Malikh Family easily, but that didn’t mean Lyla still wasn’t as useful.</p>\n<p>“Very well. Let us go with that,” then he asked the maid responsible for Lyla’s schedule. “What was Young Lady Lyla doing this afternoon?”</p>\n<p>The maid replied, “Young Lady Bhela Malikh carried her around to play. At first, they went to Malikh Family’s orchard to pick some fruits. Then they visited the sick Patriarch Malikh in his room for a few minutes. After that, they went outside to stroll and came back with a new rabbit pet they bought from other family. Finally, when the sun is setting, they went to the kitchen to watch the servants cooking.”</p>\n<p>“How uncouth for a noble young lady being led around in dirty places like that,” Butler Tim was displeased, but nothing he could do since making Bhela’s attention elsewhere meant he could move freely to make a trap for her. Nodding to himself, the butler then gave an instruction to the maid, “you go to Young Lady Lyla and tell that Malikh Family invite her for a dinner.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was excitedly rubbing his hands when Butler Tim said that. Finally, payback to those imbecile Elder Khasim!</p>\n<p>“But, Butler Tim…” the maid hesitated.</p>\n<p>“What is it?”</p>\n<p>“Malikh Family already invited Young Lady Lyla to have dinner. She’s eating in Malikh Family’s hall right now….”</p>\n<p>“Hmm, what do you mean?”</p>\n<p>What the maid meant was that someone in Malikh Family already brought Lyla to have dinner with them.</p>\n<p>When Butler Tim playing political games and scheming around in Malikh Family, Bhela Malikh, along with the elders friendly with Elder Khasim, had been giving bunch of candies and food for Lyla Blackwood, much more than the biscuits Butler Tim brought with him. Being a great foodie herself, Lyla never had enough, the first day in Malikh Family she ate more sweets and foods worth of one week back in Blackwood Family’s manor. Aunt Jiji and other Blackwood Family’s maid servants would freak out if they saw how glutton Lyla currently was.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the news that the main family’s faction hosting a dinner for a noble miss swept Malikh Family like a thunderstorm. The neutral elders Elder Jhamil had just bought flocking back toward Elder Khasim’s side. It was so sudden. Everyone wasn’t even got a breath to process what had happened. And this for sure was an unprecedented move ever since Patriarch Ghalim suddenly fell ill and retreated from the political scene.</p>\n<p>Just as one side was busy completing the first stage to win over the Young Lady of Malikh Family, the other side already won over Young Lady of the noble Blackwood Family. All happened in a span of a single day.</p>\n<p>“Y-young Lady Lyla…”</p>\n<p>Even Butler Tim couldn’t pull his own young miss seeing how happy she was. His plan had been jabbed in a completely unexpected way. Maybe he wasn’t so smart after all.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>It was unfortunate that Madam Malikh didn’t see the Young Noble Miss of Blackwood Family kindly. Even though the girl did nothing wrong, Madam Malikh wasn’t so muddled that she wasn’t aware what Blackwood Family and those corrupt elders conspiring against her husband and Malikh’s main family. Even Bhela herself couldn’t do anything to change her mother’s mind.</p>\n<p>However, Lyla Blackwood, an airhead as she always was, was oblivious of the hostility directed toward her.</p>\n<p>It was morning the second day Lyla in Badril Village. Following her friend Bhela, she carried a little box inside Patriarch Ghalim’s bedroom. This little box filled with custom-made medicines--most were amateurly mixed from two different trivial medicines, consisted of remedies for flu and headache. Nothing harmful but nothing useful at the same time. And just like yesterday, to pay for Bhela parents’ kindness for letting her staying in Malikh Family, Lyla Blackwood decided to play doctor a little bit.</p>\n<p>“Uncle, I’m coming again to help you feel better,” Lyla said as she dragged a chair and sat beside Patriarch Ghalim’s sick bed. Seeing the pale middle-aged man in bed, she blinked her googly eyes, then continued, “how’s yesterday medicine I gave you. Are you feeling a tiny minny bit better, perhaps?”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim certainly was feeling better these past few days, not because Lyla’s medicines, but Grandpa Piss’s diagnosis and remedies. Toward this girl, he weakly nodded. “Thank you for your help, little lady.”</p>\n<p>“Then I’m going to fed you my newest recipe, uncle. Here, here, open your mouth.”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghamil did what he was told. Because Lyla didn’t like bitter medicine, she added lots of brown sugar. Lots and lots of brown sugar.</p>\n<p>“It’s… sweet.”</p>\n<p>“Are you feeling better, now?” Lyla asked.</p>\n<p>“Yes, little lady, I’m feeling better.”</p>\n<p>As a matter of fact, he wasn’t. The medicine was more like a candy than remedy.</p>\n<p>“Good! If you eat this three times a day, maybe your illness would go away, uncle,” Lyla then sternly pointed out, “maybe!”</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh was nervous when her husband consumed the strange medicine Lyla gave him, but she didn’t open her mouth to protest. Bhela was changing the pillows’ sheet nearby, and doing some other chores that usually were done by the servants. In the meantime, Lyla was giving advice for Patriarch Ghalim liked how he should eat moderately three times a day, how he should brush his teeth after he ate sweets, and all the things Aunt Jiji told Lyla all the time.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to visit again, uncle, get well soon!” Lyla waved her hands. Carrying a broom in her hands, Lyla’s next schedule was following Bhela doing chores in the courtyard.</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim weakly waved his hand back. Of course, after the girls were already gone, he noticed his bitter wife biting her lips indignantly.</p>\n<p>“Don’t stare the girl so much. She’s not responsible for her family’s wrongdoings. It’s not like a girl her age knows what her parents do behind the scene.”</p>\n<p>“Why did you eat that? What if they used her to give you more poison?”</p>\n<p>“Bhela wouldn’t let me have the medicine if she didn’t what it was, no? Stop putting that kind of face, you only make our daughter feels awkward about all this.”</p>\n<p>The woman held her husband’s hand, kissing it with her forehead as she hid her face. She whispered, “Oh, don’t you know how hurt this heart holding back my grievance? Why did our daughter had to bring someone from that family inside our roof?” she sniffed, “how long this farce gonna last? What should I do in the mean time? Oh! I don’t know! I don’t know!”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim sighed as he witnessed his wife cried helplessly.</p>\n<p>In the courtyard, near the coops where Malikh Family raised chickens and ducks, Lyla was squatting in front of the new bunny she and Bhela bought just yesterday. She was waiting the whole morning just to feed this bunny. The bunny hopped around, itching to play in spite it couldn’t resist the temptation of delicious green leaves, again and again. Wathing how glutton the bunny was, Lyla found herself immerse in immense joy. She very much envying the life of a bunny. Perhaps that because she could relate to how it spent its day without worry; eating, playing, sleeping, then playing again--a life that she longed to have. If only she was born a rabbit instead of a young lady of noble family….</p>\n<p>The sound of the broom swept the ground took away her attention. Lyla couldn’t understand how a daughter of a patriarch like Bhela had to work so much.</p>\n<p>“Why do you work so much, Sistah?” Lyla asked when she found out there still much dry leaves Bhela had to sweep. “Won’t you get bored soon? Just let the servants clean this place.”</p>\n<p>Bhela, sweeping as if Lyla’s idleness didn’t bother her the slightest, replied, “Here in Badril Village, everyone who hasn’t done their coming of age ceremony has to do chores for their parents. It doesn’t matter if it’s the farmer’s daughter or the biggest family’s young lady, helping the matter of the household is one of the seven virtues we Mossack people get to do for our parents.”</p>\n<p>Originally, Lyla wanted her friend also playing with the bunny. But hearing Bhela just said something serious, there was no way she’d reveal her intention now. “My mom always nagging me to go to dance lesson or whatever. It’s very very boring,” she murmured, a bit dejected.</p>\n<p>“The west and the south have different values,” Bhela said. “Complete your virtue for your parents then you’ll grow to be a fine lady, Lyla.”</p>\n<p>“Uggghhh…” Lyla grunted as she didn’t want to continue the topic any further. She long developed a sense for her own survival to detect whether or not the conversation ended up she being forced to do some boring stuff. Knowing Bhela’s personality, Lyla knew soon Sis Bhela’d make her doing chores too. Grabbing the bunny, Lyla quickly escaped somewhere else so that she could spend her time playing. Bhela shook her head seeing the girl’s behavior.</p>\n<p>Bhela then noticed some servants whispering while they looking at Lyla from the distance. Many people were curious what a noble young lady like her would do in a rural place like this, and Bhela wasn’t that oblivious not to notice the eyes planted by the elders of Malikh Family.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, she then saw four girls dressed in expensive garments approaching Lyla with their mouth covered with feathered fans in their hands. Their clothing looked as if they attending some sort of ceremony, while in fact, they calculated that this kind of appearance was the most suitable for them to socialize with a girl of blue-blooded origin. Bhela recognized the leader of those girls was actually Elder Jhamil’s niece.</p>\n<p>“Have you read Le Armour dan Varoza written by Leornador De Gonzalez, Young Lady Blackwood?”</p>\n<p>“Ah, yes, that piece was adequately sophisticated but I think Vista van Gracious’s omnibus more than adequate, le banjour?”</p>\n<p>“I see, I see, their pieces adequately well-written as those senor themselves adequattely live as maestro. But perhaps equoliette more than fit the diagram as paradigm sensorita abligioate senor des adequately le banjour.”</p>\n<p>“But of course, Young Lady Blackwood is more addequately sophisitacted as it’s a noblesse obligiote to be more sohpisitacated than us village senioritas. Perhaps le banjour is fortuna with de gracious by Young Lady’s great wisdom?”</p>\n<p>Lyla blinked her eyes trying to decipher whatever these girls mean. The bunny in her arms even escaped amidst her confusion.</p>\n<p>“Uhh… uhhh…” Lyla timidly stepped back from the feathered fan girls. “I think Sis Bhela is calling me…”</p>\n<p>She swiftly ran away back to her friend Bhela.</p>\n<p>“Sistah, Sistah Bhela!” Lyla cried and grabbing Bhela’s sloven sleeve tightly, demanding for justice, “they came to bully me!”</p>\n<p>“What did they do?” Bhela asked.</p>\n<p>“They know I can’t speak western language! They came to test me! They’re even worse than those rich girls in seminar--they jumble some western mumbo jumbo into plain language in order to confuse me! They must be laughing and call me stupid by now!”</p>\n<p>Hearing Lyla’s grievance, Bhela patted her head in order to let the girl calmed down.</p>\n<p>“Lyla, those girls are different than the noble girls that always making fun of you.”</p>\n<p>“Different? How so?”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at the girls who also was watching them back while fanning themselves with their fabulous feathered fans.</p>\n<p>“They looked like noble descendants, but actually were not.”</p>\n<p>“I still don’t like them nonetheless!”</p>\n<p>“You don’t have to talk to them if you don’t want to,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>Yet Lyla still restlessly tugging Bhela’s sleeves, making it harder for her to do her chores. Before the peers that always making fun of her, Lyla was always helpless and had been depending on Bhela’s figure as a shield. What it looked like from the point of view of an outsider was a scene where a young mother being tested of her patience dealing with a girl who was throwing a tantrum.</p>\n<p>Seeing that the young noble miss wouldn’t come back soon, the feathered fan girls approaching Bhela and Lyla instead.</p>\n<p>“Oh, fancy to meet Young Lady Bhela here, le banjour!”</p>\n<p>“Le bonjour…” Bhela hesitated to reply back. Tilting her head slightly, she studied the pompously dressed girls before her. These girls were relatives of Malikh Family’s elders. None of them could match with Bhela if talking strictly about social status wise, not to mention talents. However, while she was holding her broom, it looked like Bhela was the one with common origin, while these girls were floating swans who happened to be generous enough to greet plebeians with their <em>unique</em> vocabulary.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Lyla Blackwood hid behind Lyla’s back. Despite a noble origin herself, meeting more cocky and fake young ladies than the girls before her were rare experience for Lyla.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela, fancy to meet you. Good morning. The weather is nice. I eat snails everyday,” Elder Jhamil’s niece took the lead and said that with a hint of inflated pride.</p>\n<p>Bhela narrowed her eyes. She could see why Lyla instantly hated these girls. She then said in a sleek foreign language, “Je ne sais pas de quoi tu parles. Si vous ne parlez pas une langue étrangère, fermez simplement la bouche, sinon vous faites peur aux enfants avec votre non-sens.”</p>\n<p>The feathered fan girls blinked their eyes trying to decipher whatever Bhela had said.</p>\n<p>“Oh, it turns out Young Lady Bhela is aquadettely know some le banjour!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, Young Lady Bhela is adequately sophisticated after all. Me gusta!”</p>\n<p>“I see, I see, le pasta fortuna is delicosaza.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s niece didn’t say anything as she only maintained a sweet smile while being nervous herself. Racking her brains over remembering the contents of thick dictionary, she tried to form a decent sentences in foreign language. But Bhela then cut off her train of thought before she could say a word.</p>\n<p>“Blackwood Family is migrating noble that has long been making their roots here in southern land. Hundred of years living far away from their western peers, noble families like this would naturally become more lax. It’s natural for Lyla to not mastering her homeland’s native tongue.”</p>\n<p>Bhela said that in a straight manner. That was a white lie, however. It was true that many noble families coming from the western side of Tiramikal Continent to forgot their western root and began to see themselves as southerners. But those were usually the case depending right circumstances, like exiled nobles, or some young masters who had lost in political battle branched out and fancied themselves a legit noble family with themselves at the helm. Blackwood Family weren’t exiled nobles, and though Lyla’s ancestors branching out some hundreds of years ago, that didn’t automatically made them cutting off ties with the original family. The main family of Blackwood was back in a western country called Tatalghia Kingdom, still sending letters and envoys from time to time to the branch Lyla was living in--although, undeniably, the southern branch of Blackwood Family had long developed and surpassed the main one.</p>\n<p>It seemed like Bhela already used to tell this lie. Anyone who heard this would be forced to accept it, unless they wanted to spend time and resources digging through the details--which to be honest, none of these pompous young girls were willing or simply unable to go through.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Elder Jhamil’s niece believed Lyla’s family exempt her to excel in foreign language. Yet she was still displeased inside. Her uncle told her that Bhela had been hogging the young noble’s influence for herself, everyone in Malikh Family already knew how Bhela Malikh carrying around the noble young lady yesterday. So what if she had some more bit of talent and had been running around overseas in that whatever seminars she was attending? A bumpkin origin wouldn’t be able to change their bumpkin bloodline. So if Bhela had the right to get close with the Young Lady of Blackwood Family, that meant someone coming from the same family should have the same change as her!</p>\n<p>The elder’s niece said, “Young Lady Bhela, I know the main family is prideful. But Young Lady Blackwood is here to experience the village slow life. Don’t you think she also needs to mingle with us commoners?”</p>\n<p>“Lyla will befriend any person she fancies herself, I don’t control with whom she wants to socialize with,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“If that’s the case, then why she still has no friends other than you?”</p>\n<p>“That’s not true!” Lyla cried indignantly, “I’ve made friends! With aunties! Aunties in the kitchen!”</p>\n<p>It was easy to be friendly with Lyla. She was always unconventional and never saw people by the social system. To her, people only divided by two types, those who gave her food and those who didn’t. She was like a cat. Just bring a good food and she’d be very friendly the next moment.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Lyla’s frank open-mindedness wasn’t easily accepted by some people. Elder Jhamil’s niece gasped as she looked at Lyla and Bhela, back and forth. “My goodness! Young Lady Bhela, were you letting a noble young lady such as Young Lady Blackwood mingle with dirty servants?!”</p>\n<p>“Why wouldn’t I?” Bhela asked back.</p>\n<p>“You--don’t young lady care about our family’s reputation? What if people said we’ve mistreated a noble young lady?”</p>\n<p>“Lyla is here to experience village slow life,” Bhela said slowly, “don’t you think she also needs to mingle with commoners?”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s niece was speechless as Bhela used her own words. The contorted expression on her chaky make-up face brought satisfaction for Lyla, who then snorted.</p>\n<p>“What now? Kitty got your tongue?” Lyla said with her mouth pouted. “So that you know, Sis Bhela already made speechless many many bullies like you! Who were many many many times smarter than you! This is what you get by making fun of me--shame on you, hmph! Who’s the stupid one, now?”</p>\n<p>Even after losing a round of squabble against Young Lady Bhela, unexpectedly the nobly young lady herself became hostile against her. All was so sudden that it made blood drained from her face.</p>\n<p>Bhela ruffled Lyla’s hair. Apparently Lyla still believed these girls came to bully her. When Lyla already made up her mind to not liking someone, it was hard to bend on her opinion.</p>\n<p>“Let’s go, Lyla. We’ll help aunties make sweets for afternoon lunch,” Bhela said. Back in the seminars, when Bhela asked Lyla to do some chores, the supposed noble young lady of Blackwood Family would move slowly, occasionally pouting and murmuring some complaints, unwilling to exert her calories on some boring stuff. However, it was different if the destination was kitchen. The spirit of lively bunny would come to possess her--she’d jolt, sprinting, unwilling to waste time as the promise of free sweets and delicious salty snacks was revealed before her.</p>\n<p>“What was that about?!” one of the le bonjour girls scowled after Bhela and Lyla was gone. “How could a young lady speaks like that?”</p>\n<p>“Bhela must lead her around to act like that! Did you hear what she said? The noble young lady thinks we bully her or something.”</p>\n<p>“Aahhh! What a manipulative bitch! I really want to know what that little cunt said to make Young Lady Blackwood think we had made fun of her. No way in hell someone would dare making fun of a noble like her!”</p>\n<p>Actually, Lyla was made fun of so many times. Especially during her study in the seminars abroad. She made fun of so much that she formed a survival instinct to hide behind Bhela’s back. But they didn’t know that. They just assumed as a young lady coming from a noble family, Lyla Blackwood would be adequately pure noble in stories and gossip. The main reason Bhela brought Lyla away was so that Lyla didn’t have to mingle with these delusional le bonjour girls.</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-1/chapter-62":"<p>When the news about what happened in Malikh Family’s ngajen ceremony arrived at Blackwood Family, Madam Blackwood was so enraged she broke the tea cup she held onto the floor. Establishing the family’s foot in Badril Village was supposed to be easy, but not only he failed to gain the support of Malikh Family and the villagers, the Young Master of Blackwood Family somehow managed to incite the bedridden patriarch’s supporters to regain their lost foothold against the corrupt Malikh Family’s elders.</p>\n<p>“There’s no point keeping him in that rural village,” Madam Blackwood said. She was a flamboyant, late thirty years old woman whose beauty was so superior that the previous viscount adopt her as a daughter. “Call Frane back to the city, he’s going to spend two months training in capital!”</p>\n<p>The butler who was waiting for her bowed and went away to carry out the task.</p>\n<p>“How’s Lyla’s birthday party going?”</p>\n<p>“Reply to madam, the party has started, the guests who came only from baron nobilities and mid-rank merchants,” a maid replied.</p>\n<p>The madam glanced the timid middle-aged man who sat on the same table as her. She scoffed, saying, “Look how your daughter made a name for herself. Not only the bribe money was wasted away, she coming on trips in the seminars only resulting her made a fool out of herself! Hah, like father, like daughter! Imbecile!”</p>\n<p>Madam Blackwood hurled the new cup that recently poured with hot, scalding tea. She purposely aimed at the table so the hot water splashed on the viscount’s hands. The timid viscount didn’t make a sound when his hands getting burnt, he didn’t dare to fight against his wife. It was already ten years too late for him to retaliate in any way. From the way he dragged his limping leg to fetch damp towel for his scaling skin, it was clear the waiting servants already used to ignore him.</p>\n<p>Recently, his wife’s mood had became the worst ever since their youngest daughter came back from the two years seminars. Unlike Frane--who only registered as his son by blood in papers, Lyla hadn’t show any particular talents in becoming a Class worthy of a noble family. She had a decent progress speed, a Level 7 Novice after seminars, but that progress mainly because she never had the interest to train herself. Madam Blackwood had bribed the officials so Lyla could enter the seminars supposed to boost her standing in high society, so she could catch higher ranking nobles eyes somehow. However, that plan failed in the worst way that could happen to a noble family like the Blackwood. She made blunders and broke rules so many times that she became a laughing stock. The only families that interested in her only lower rank nobles and not-so well off merchant families.</p>\n<p>“There also no point keeping that useless girl forever in the mansion,” Madam Blackwood said. “Send her to Badril Village by tomorrow. Make some smart men tending to her needs--they have to smart enough to know how to reel those Malikh villagers to say yes when I send my words in the future!”</p>\n<p>After the son’s failure, the madam would send her daughter, to do nothing but play around in Malikh Family. Even if there was something the girl could do, the madam surely wouldn’t choose this daughter of hers who she deemed too brainless to do even the simplest tasks. Her daughter was just that useless to her. The one with received the orders were people who accompanied her, who had experience in bribing and coercing. They were tasked to devour Malikh Family from the inside. The Blackwood would surely corner Bhela Malikh this time.</p>\n<p>Somewhere else, in a colorless courtyard, a birthday party already went on for about two hours. Most guests already leaving, not unlike the year before the two-years seminars happened when the sons of noble families dallying around waiting for a chance to talk with the young lady. Today, the Young Lady of Blackwood Family turned fourteen, two years before she would considered mature, but this young miss still pouting her mouth like a little girl.</p>\n<p>The old handmaid saw her young lady was bored and offered a treat.</p>\n<p>“Young lady, try this cake. A certain famous bakery made this just for your birthday.”</p>\n<p>The cake served on a small plate along with a silver fork. The girl took only mere seconds to finish it.</p>\n<p>“Is it good?” the handmaid asked.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t matter if it’s good or not, Aunt Jiji, I still hungry with this tiny minny bit of cake! Let me eat that one!” the girl pointed at the layered cake served on the center of the party.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Lyla, you can’t!”</p>\n<p>“Why can’t I?!”</p>\n<p>“You must present yourself as a proper young lady, so you can’t!”</p>\n<p>The cake was to be portioned to serve for the same amount of guests since the last party, but because the Blackwood Family’s young lady had a bad reputation in the seminars, most invited families didn’t actually come.</p>\n<p>“But I can’t be a lady if I’m hungry, am I?”</p>\n<p>“You must learn the way. Be patient, Young Lady Lyla!”</p>\n<p>“But I am huuungriiiiieeeehhh!!!”</p>\n<p>Aunt Jiji was terrified when she realized the young lady wasn’t referred only to portion of the cake, but she wanted to eat the whole cake. This shorty girl, although her feature was thin with only her cheeks got plump, actually had a talent to be a terrifying glutton that would be seen in Tiramikal Continent every one hundred years. It was a useless talent that brought only shame to Blackwood Family.</p>\n<p>It was fortunate that before the young lady could make a big ruckus, a maidservant came to bring the news about the madam’s decision. Aunt Jiji passed it to the young lady immediately.</p>\n<p>“You heard that, young lady! Madam is going to send you for a vacation!”</p>\n<p>Lyla’s head straightened, she forgot to pout. “Vacation? Where? Where where?”</p>\n<p>“To Badril Village!”</p>\n<p>“Badril Village?” the girl tilted her head. “Where’s that?”</p>\n<p>“If you promise Aunt Jiji not to eat too much cake today, Aunt Jiji will tell you where it is…”</p>\n<p>“I will if it turned out somewhere fun!”</p>\n<p>“Badril Village is where Young Lady Bhela’s home place!”</p>\n<p>“Sis Bhela’s home?!” Lyla gasped, “yahoooo!!!”</p>\n<p>Ignoring that she was the center of attention, Lyla suddenly jumped and danced like no tomorrow. Aunt Jiji tried to stop her, but it was futile since Lyla only promised not to be glutton. The remaining guests began whispering with each other. They were people who doubted the rumors about this Young Lady Blackwood, but after seeing how childish and ridiculous the girl danced, people were finally convinced. How was this a viscount’s daughter supposed to act? The girl danced her hips and hopped around like a bunny that had an itchy bum. Soon, the Young Lady Lyla Blackwood fell to the bottom list of desired young ladies to marry. Her reputation fell from not-so-smart, to stupid, and then fell again to brainless and imbecile. People didn’t see her in a good light. But that just how a girl named Lyla Blackwood really was.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Yashura Family got a peculiar visitor these past two days. He introduced himself as an expert from overseas, and somehow this foreign expert became interested in Shira Yashura. When the story leaked by insiders from Yashura Family, people were scratching their heads, wondering what could an educated man saw from this trash who could only get himself to level 3 Novice. Some people even sneered, saying that whole news was just Yashura Family’s little trick to clear up rumors from their heir’s name.</p>\n<p>“You understand, kiddo? There are three mandatory rules if someone wants to meet privately with me. First rule, it’s a <em>she</em>, not <em>he</em>. Second rule, big boobs. Third rule, in her lower part, there must be big bubbly butts, as big as her boobs. <em>Anything</em> lesser than that you can just send them back to wherever they came from.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit said that as he moved his chess piece, eating one of Shira’s pawns.</p>\n<p>“And remember, my standard is pretty high. Consult with how loadful those girls from Big-Boobed Sect are for more information,” the Nalaq continued.</p>\n<p>“Please don’t talk nonsense. I’m being serious here,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“Ey, I’m not talking nonsense. The girls from Big-Boobed Sect are real deal, okay? They’re huge! If you don’t believe me then you should go to Elzhier Family one of these days, go check out how glorious their boobs are. They always dance or become the maidservants when they’re not on duties.”</p>\n<p>“Ol’ Good-Natured Spirit… I don’t want to hear this imaginary all-woman sect of yours. Elzhier Family is only a normal rural family, they don’t host any sect members within their walls. If they did, the Village Head would boast about it at my uncle’s face every single day.”</p>\n<p>“You just don’t believe it because you never see how great they are--their boobs, I mean. How great those melons inside tight suits are! Just think about it; leather suits and melons--two entirely different things but if they come together they’d jiggling in harmony. This Good-Natured Spirit approved their sense of style.”</p>\n<p>“Forget about it, it’s not important--”</p>\n<p>“Boobs are important, ey!”</p>\n<p>Shira waved his hand as he didn’t want to continue this nonsense. He then moved a piece and finished his turn. He returned the topic back again, “The expert said he came from a first-tier faction called Blue Robe Society. If we can get his faction’s recognition then at least my family can silence all those rumors about me--especially the recent ones, they really are becoming a pain in the ass.”</p>\n<p>“I told you. I don’t talk with guys. No boobs, no good. Period.”</p>\n<p>“You are really becoming a pain in the ass,” Shira complained.</p>\n<p>After Shira said that, Good-Natured Spirit’s knight jumped over a wall of pawns to get on his bishop. Within a single breath Shira immediately moved his rook, creating a chain reaction that exposes the Nalaq’s defence, resulting his king trapped in three different direction.</p>\n<p>“Check mate.”</p>\n<p>“Ey, what the fu--” Good-Natured Spirit rage quit, flipping the chess board. “Hah! I knew it! You brat, you intentionally make me talk about boobs in order to lower my guard, right?! Fuck! That is how it is, isn’t it?!”</p>\n<p>“No, it is not.”</p>\n<p>“You sneaky bastard. You really got me,” Good-Natured Spirit threw his hands up in the air. <br>\n“Man, I surrender, that is some sick psychological tactic you got there.”</p>\n<p>“Now I don’t really know what you’re talking about.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit waved his hands in surrender, then he lit a cigarette. “Anyway, what do you want from me this time? Money again? I prepared some kobe coins enough for you to buy some candy, here, take this.”</p>\n<p>Shira shoved back the coin bag. “Not today. I just want you to meet Sir Baront Staterwind.”</p>\n<p>“No boobs, no good. Ask something else. How about I tell you the secret place where are those Big-Boobed Sect girls take their bath, ‘ey? Seems fair deal to me.”</p>\n<p>“How many times do I have to tell you--”</p>\n<p>“Sssshhh!!” Good-Natured Spirit hushed the boy. He then whispered, “you hear that?”</p>\n<p>Because the Nalaq suddenly became vigilant, Shira instinctively lowered his voice too. “Hear what?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“I heard some rats watching us…” the Nalaq covered his mouth, as if he didn’t want people to read lips what he said next, “some big-boobed rats…”</p>\n<p>“Huh… what?”</p>\n<p>“The girls from Big-Boobed Sect… they’re here…”</p>\n<p>“The heck are you talking about? This hill is Yashura Family’s property--”</p>\n<p>“Sssshhhh! They’ve noticed me noticing them. Wait here, I’mma get you some melons for your reward!”</p>\n<p>After he saying that, Good-Natured Spirit’s figure melting into the thin air.</p>\n<p>Shira Yashura sighed. At times, asking favor to this vulgar Nalaq not only difficult, it also unpredictable he’d only incite troubles if he not careful.</p>\n<p>After his winning streak for more than half a year maybe he became cocky. He forgot the Nalaq wasn’t there to solve his problem whenever he wanted, although the Nalaq sort of ended up like that after a few months he came here. Shira got some thinking, maybe he should stop seeing this Nalaq as his convenient piggy bank for his own good.</p>\n<p>“Really, he always making a mess for me to clean. I wonder if such thoughtless Nalaqs like him are common around here… now, where’s the last piece again?” he sighed for the second time.</p>\n<p>When he was picking up chess pieces that board Good-Natured Spirit flipped earlier, Shira realized there was a missing piece. Turned out it was stuck in the hole between tree roots.</p>\n<p>He plunged his hand to look for the missing chess piece.</p>\n<p>“Ugh… my fingers can’t reach.”</p>\n<p>He tried to squirm his body to fit his hand in.</p>\n<p>“Where is it again?”</p>\n<p>He frowned. He squirmed his body again really hard.</p>\n<p>“Oh, there it--”</p>\n<p><em>BOOOOOMMMMM!!!!</em></p>\n<p>An explosion happened not far away from the place he used to hang out, creating a wave of rolling dust that swept over the hill. Shira got his hand stuck between the tree rots, he could only hugged his head with his free hand and waited for the shockwave to finish. The chess pieces he gathered already nowhere to be found. He cooked up his head, looking left and right, and saw the greeny grasses were covered with dirts and trees were uprooted. The whole hill became a shithole kind of mess.</p>\n<p>Before the boy could swallow what was going on, a chuckle could be heard near him. Before him, Good-Natured Spirit emerged, coiling around the Nalaq’s body were purple-colored living flames that hungrily tried to eat him whole.</p>\n<p>As carefree as he usually was, Good-Natured Spirit said with a grin, “Those Big-Boobed Sect girls sure are feisty. They’re escaping too fast, I can’t get you melons. I managed to get a feeling of their butts, though. Here, there’s some fragrant left behind.”</p>\n<p>Shira stepped back when the Nalaq offered his palm. It was still on fire, the boy didn’t want to get burn along with him. Besides, he didn’t want to get involved with the Nalaq’s deprived hobby.</p>\n<p>“Sure you don’t want it?” Good-Natured Spirit took a last sniff from his palm, followed by a low chuckle of his.</p>\n<p>“Good-Natured Spirit… what’s that fire?”</p>\n<p>“Yeah? Dunno, man. Exorcism flame or something.”</p>\n<p>“Ohh… oh, it’s very nice to know you up until know. Good bye.”</p>\n<p>“Hmm? You want to go somewhere?” Realizing the purple flame was getting annoying, Good-Natured Spirit then patted away the coiling flame from his shoulders like it was nothing.</p>\n<p>Shira shrugged his shoulders. It seemed this bastard Nalaq was too tough for that exorcism flame. Maybe the flame was too ordinary? Whatever, he didn’t care about that anymore. His eyes then swept the ruin around him. He said, “You can’t forget about the meeting for today. But please clean the mess you made yourself.”</p>\n<p>“That’s what you want for the chess reward?”</p>\n<p>Shira nodded.</p>\n<p>“Aye, aye, will do.” Good-Natured Spirit flicked his fingers, and human-sized paper cranes came out of thin air. They were obedient, not clear whether were monsters or just magical devices. The paper cranes used magnet-like magic to carry the messy uprooted trees and boulders, along with sweeping the dirt from the grass. The cleaning up might take a while, since the hill really was a mess. Shira, feeling a little light on the head, facepalming as he returned back to Yashura Family.</p>\n<p>The whole explosion could be heard from all over Badril Village. It wasn’t clear what its cause, but Yashura Family sent guards to prevent people from knowing what really happened. In Yashura Family’s guest hall, Patriarch Shuro Yashura, a few good Yashura Family elders, and the respected visitor, Sir Baront Staterwind, forming a circle as they sat cross-legged, discussing the explosion that had just occurred.</p>\n<p>“Good elders, Sir Patriarch Yashura, I know you must get excited when I said Young Master Shira has some talent in communicating with Nalaqs. However, a Nalaq still a Nalaq. You must not offend a Nalaq whatsoever, or the consequence is dire! Young Master Shira’s life is way more important than getting a qualification to enter my school!” Sir Baront Staterwind warned. His forehead was still wet with sweat, since he hurriedly ran to Yashura Family when he realized the direction of recent explosion.</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, you’re right, Sir Staterwind. Absolutely right! I already sent someone to check on my nephew’s condition, please calm down,” Patriarch Shuro said.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront shook his head. “You don’t really know what I’m trying to say, do you? You should prepare a very good healer or a doctor, Patriarch Shuro, because if it isn’t death, one can easily lose a limb over angering a Nalaq! That happens more often than you think!”</p>\n<p>The elders drew cold breaths in unison when they heard that. Patriarch Shuro, whose face already pale, becoming even whiter than a sheet of paper. If they boy lost a limb, Shira’s chance to succeed him as the next patriarch could be swept away like specks of dust.</p>\n<p>Yulong the Butler arrived. Everyone in the room had been anxiously waiting for him they instinctively stood up when Yulong approached.</p>\n<p>“Yulong, how’s Shira doing?” Patriarch Shuro asked.</p>\n<p>Yulong replied, “Young Master Shira is back, patriarch. But Madam Yashura sent him to the kitchen for a second breakfast.”</p>\n<p>“Breakfast? What’s a breakfast has something to do with that explosion? Can he still walk?”</p>\n<p>“He’s walking fine, Patriarch Yashura.”</p>\n<p>“Then, Yulong, please go fetch my nephew for me, we have something urgent to tell him!”</p>\n<p>After his trained elegant bow, Yulong stepped back and proceeded to do the task given to him.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront Staterwind peered at the butler’s back. He traveled southern lands many times, visiting many villages, yet, he seldom heard a Mossack descent major family employed western-style butler. What made him confused even more that Sir Kurusiya apparently knew the butler and gave his respect to him, which Sir Baront Staterwind didn’t expect that coming from the cold eastern Kaya swordsman.</p>\n<p>“Dear good elder,” Sir Baront Staterwind asked a random elder who sat beside him, “may I know why there’s a butler working here?”</p>\n<p>“Is Sir referring to Yulong? Yulong isn’t actually working for Yashura Family, but Young Master Shira’s mother’s attendant. I can’t tell you the details, so forgive me sir, all I can say is Young Master Shira’s father is exceedingly brave and awesome he managed to woo a respectable lady many years ago.”</p>\n<p>“Ahhh…” Sir Baront nodded. The boy apparently a result of his parent eloping. The Blue Robe Society expert of course knew etiquette to hold himself from digging the story further.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, Yulong came back with Shira followed behind. The boy wore new clothes since his previous one was dirty. When he saw the group of elders and the expert guest looking at him, Shira sighed inside his heart. He knew he had to clean Good-Natured Spirit’s mess once again.</p>\n<p>“Greetings, elders… greetings, uncle patriarch… greetings, Sir Staterwind…”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro impatiently treading forward. “Shira my boy, is it true that you lost your limbs?”</p>\n<p>“I’m unhurt, uncle, see?” Shira waved both of his hands to prove that his limbs still functioned as they should be.</p>\n<p>“Oh! God, thank God! Really! These are really your hands, aren’t they? Not a fake one made with wood?” Patriarch Shuro Yashura grabbed his nephew hands and waved it around like a child playing with flags.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira,” Sir Baront opened his mouth, “I reckon you failed to ask the Nalaq to meet me? If you can’t do it, young master, it best for you not to push him any further. Today, you offend him and he blast the hill behind your Yashura Family as a warning, but what happens if you make the same mistake tomorrow?”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro nodded at his words vigorously. “Sir Baront is right, Shira my boy. A Nalaq is a revered being ancient Mossacks worshiped as their guardian angel. The consequence of making them mad is very dire! You should know better, my boy, you should’ve told your uncle if a Nalaq came to you the first time!”</p>\n<p>Sir Baront and his uncle Patriarch Shuro had good intentions in telling him about how to be respectful to a Nalaq. But the more Shira heard their warning, the more he doubted about Good-Natured Spirit being a “revered” Nalaq like they said. Of course, saying the truth about the explosion’s true cause resulting only Yashura Family losing face in front of Sir Baront Staterwind. Shira had no choice, he had to tread the matter very carefully.</p>\n<p>“<em>Cough, cough</em>… Uncle, Sir Baront, thank you for your concern. Truth is, it wasn’t that the Nalaq being mad that causes the explosion, but there was some… accident… that happened right before.”</p>\n<p>“With what title do you usually call him, Young Master Shira?” Sir Baront asked.</p>\n<p>“As far as I know, he doesn’t have a title. At least he didn’t tell me if he ever had one. He told me to call him ‘Good-Natured Spirit’.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, with that kind of nickname, he must be a very benevolent person when he was alive,” Sir Baront concluded as he rubbed his beard. “So, Young Master Shira, it seems he didn’t really intent to blast into smithereens.”</p>\n<p>Shira nodded. That part was true. Instead, someone else happened to be intending to blast this Nalaq into smithereens.</p>\n<p>“Thank God! Thank God! If he is a good Nalaq, maybe we don’t need to throw the second ngajen ceremony for this month, after all!” Patriarch Shuro Yashura exclaimed. The elders in the guest hall followed his exclaiming by handclapping and joyful cries. Ngajen ceremony only held once a month so the village safe from angry Selaqs, no one ever tried it to protect themselves from intelligent Nalaqs. Since the village was founded, the locals never had a Nalaq dwelling there. So it was natural for the elders to worry about throwing a ceremony they didn’t know working or not. Ngajen ceremony was expensive, after all.</p>\n<p>The more Shira saw how the previous tense hall turned jubilant and full of relieved faces, the more awkward he became. That Nalaq might call himself ‘Good-Natured Spirit’, yet he was anything but good. A low-life spirit who no doubt had been using the invisibility traits of spirits to commit many deprived crimes. He was closer to evil spirit incarnation than a good-natured one. The misunderstanding was too great his face twisted as if he’d just taste a sour lemon.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront Staterwind said, “Still, since he seems reluctant to use his old name, I reckon the Nalaq that approaching you is a low-tier one, Young Master Shira. Low-tier Nalaqs usually spirits that gain consciousness merely by luck. They don’t have factions backing them, and fortunately--in my experience--it easier to initiate negotiation with unaffiliated Nalaqs.” A hint of pride then flashed through his eyes, he continued, “my disciples will arrive tomorrow morning. One of them contracted with a high-tier Nalaq. Since the Nalaq’s mood turned sour is partly my fault, with help from the Nalaq contracted with one of my disciples, I will ask him to leave Yashura Family peacefully!”</p>\n<p>“Sir Staterwind is wise! Thank you for your concern, Sir!” Patriarch Shuro sang praises toward this expert. The elders of Yashura Family followed suit.</p>\n<p>“As expected of such expert!”</p>\n<p>“Sir Staterwind is the best of bunch of all experts that I know all my life!”</p>\n<p>“Hurray for Sir Staterwind!”</p>\n<p>They circling Sir Baront Staterwind and, not long after that, someone started to prostate. They behaved as if the guest was their one and only savior. Even Shira was getting embarrassed from seeing the scene, not to mention the already flushing Baront Staterwind.</p>\n<p>When everyone getting carried away, Shira slipped out after excusing himself. He knew he was no match for the Yashura Family’s older generations’ shamelessness. Upon walking outside, he saw Yulong was standing by the hall’s door looking galant as usual with his butler professionalism.</p>\n<p>“Can you please try to stop my uncle, Yulong? Sir Staterwind is started to get uncomfortable there.”</p>\n<p>Yulong glanced at the whole mess inside, and then he said to his young master, “I think it’s not everyday an expert coming to Yashura Family, young master, so let’s count this as Patriarch Yashura to gaining favors from a foreign expert.”</p>\n<p>“Are they really okay, though?”</p>\n<p>Yulong smiled.</p>\n<p>“Of course they aren’t, young master. But Patriarch Shuro and the family elders are honest people. Although sometimes they can be overwhelming, I’m sure Sir Staterwind can see no falsehood in their words.”</p>\n<p>Shira looked at those elders inside once again. The more he saw, the more he realized that those hysterical village men calling a man they barely knew these past two days a savior by no means a lie from their part. The elders really were freaking out when they heard the explosion. And Patriarch Shuro Yashura was the most worried of the bunch, considering him a patriarch and an uncle. Thinking about it all again, Shira couldn’t really say he still embarrassed seeing the elders spewing exaggerated flattering with straight faces.</p>\n<p>“Sir Staterwind comes from a respectable sect. Someone like that won’t get to travel the southern lands if he didn’t know the nature of the local people. So it best not to worry about it too much, young master,” Yulong said.</p>\n<p>“Really… ah, speaking of sects,” Shira deliberately changed the topic, “I heard from someone that one of the major families in Badril Village hosts members of a certain sect in secret. You’re from outside, Yulong--do you think something so outrageous like that could happen?”</p>\n<p>“Some older sects have long reaching influence, but I don’t think anyone would be interested to plant their own in Badril Village. There’s nothing valuable here for them to take notice.”</p>\n<p>“As I thought. It’s just unthinkable to think some secret powers lurking beneath our everyday lives. What if some experts actually pretending to be servants here in Yashura Family?”</p>\n<p>Although it wasn’t noticeable, Yulong’s smile became stiff.</p>\n<p>“You jest, young master. If that was true, do you think your uncle and the elders can take that kind of truth?”</p>\n<p>Following Yulong’s gaze, Shira peeped the hall and saw Sir Baront’s awkward figure, where he was in the center of Yashura Family elites--all of them-- who passionately prostrating in the floor. They practically worshipping him now.</p>\n<p>“You’re right…” Shira could only hide his face with his palm. Just when he thought he could understand them, the boy then wished he didn’t know these shameless men.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>As far as the current generation of Badril Village locals knew, they never got visited by nobles until this month Malikh Family’s ngajen ceremony happened. Everyone still talking about it.</p>\n<p>Young Master of Blackwood Family only stayed in Badril Village in one day. And the noble carriage of Blackwood Family set off out of Badril Village by noon. The next morning after the day he was gone, the two foreign guests who had been staying in Malikh Family, Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia, felt overstaying might be unnecessary, thus decided to leave too.</p>\n<p>Because the carriages going out from Badril Village mostly for public transports, Bhela personally asked an elder from his father’s faction who had a horse carriage to give her guests a ride to the nearest town, where they’d later book a private carriage for them to return home. Mister Harrington, as an unsocial bachelor as he always was, was waiting in the carriage for Madame Sylvia to say her parting words to Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>“You have a very bright future, Young Lady Bhela. A girl with limitless potential. So your favor will become very valuable as you mature,” Madame Sylvia said. “If you need something, you can always send letters to my sect. Don’t hold back. Just think about this of us making an investment.”</p>\n<p>Since Bhela a smart girl anyway, Madame Sylvia decided not to make her words fancy and told her in a straightforward manner. Bhela appreciated her honesty, and said her thanks.</p>\n<p>The carriage then set off. In the main gate of Badril Village, the guards on duty witnessed the recently blazing popular Young Lady Bhela Malikh bowing her body as she sent off two foreigners in traveling clothes made from expensive linen.</p>\n<p>“Look at how she is,” inside the carriage, Madame Sylvia said to Mister Harrington. “She’s a pretty sensible girl, don’t you think?”</p>\n<p>“She is,” Mister Harrington said softly, almost a murmur.</p>\n<p>It was hard to start a conversation whenever Mister Harrington sat with his arms crossed tightly. Madame Sylvia could see that he wasn’t exactly happy with the outcome regarding Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>There was no bandits lurking around, and no monsters occasionally came out, proved that the lands around Badril Village actually well-protected--too well, perhaps, for a rural village without a major power backing them. Their journey was smooth without disturbance. Thirty minutes after they left Badril Village, they encountered another carriage painted with black-jet color. The black carriage was well-decorated with golden-colored plates, obviously elites or nobles were traveling inside.</p>\n<p>However, unlike common nobles who liked to hide in the carriage to show-off their elegance and aloofness, this carriage simply out of commonsense. To talk about how weird this carriage was there was a need to point out the refreshing greenness of the view around. Despite there being a road far away from settlement, hint of liveliness from bird chirping--along with croaking frogs from nearby streams and singing insects--completed the idyllic road with a strange harmony that invited light-hearted person to sing along with lively nature. That was exactly what the noble in the black carriage doing. A young lady with a very girly and childish feature was carefreely sitting in the window in spite of pale servants begging her to sit still. She completely dumb about the servants’ pleas. And with her personality, nobody knew whether she was pretending or not. The only thing that the jubilant Lyla Blackwood cared about was singing an off-tune song about her befriending village frogs and bunnies.</p>\n<p>“Prepare your life you frogs and bunnies~</p>\n<p>Cause I’m not letting you go before we become the best of buddies~~</p>\n<p>Wait for me you birdies and kitties~~</p>\n<p>Cause we’re about to become the best of all buddies~~ yuhuu~ yuhuu~~</p>\n<p>The best buddies in this lifetime~~ yuhuuuu~~~”</p>\n<p>There was nothing the servants and the guards could do to stop their young lady from singing this amazingly ugly song about her future exploits in Badril Village. Seeing that another carriage approaching, the horse-riding guards did their best to block the view to the crest planted on the carriage’s compartment. Their effort to save faces from the young lady’s mishap was futile, however, since the other party happened to know Lyla.</p>\n<p>“How many times have I told you to stay away from windows, Lyla!”</p>\n<p>“Whu--what? Who?” Lyla was surprised. But then she was elated to see a familiar face. “Is that you, Instructor Sylvia? You here to train Sis Bhela’s archery again?”</p>\n<p>“Get down from the window!” Madame Sylvia raised her voice.</p>\n<p>“I’m also here to meet Sis Bhela!” Lyla also raised her voice cheerfully.</p>\n<p>“Lyla, you won’t be able to get married in the future if you’re always act like this!” Madame Sylvia warned her. She long dropped title of Young Lady Blackwood when talking to this naughty girl.</p>\n<p>“Um!” Lyla nodded. “But which one do you like more, Instructor Sylvia, bunnies or kitties?” It was no use trying to talk sense to Lyla. Any warning only come to her right ear and gone out straight from the left one.</p>\n<p>“Stay away from the windows!!!” Madame Sylvia screamed until her voice shrilled.</p>\n<p>Lyla also screamed, “Good morning to you too!!!”</p>\n<p>Both carriages drifted apart after the brief encounter. It ended with Lyla happily waved her hands happily. Madame Sylvia sighed and shook her head. That girl was so naughty that the troubles she created made the seminars’ managements even considered to drop her once during the seminars. Only after Bhela Malikh convinced them she’d take care of Lyla they finally did let go the matter.</p>\n<p>Before, the black carriage of Blackwood Family came to Badril Village in the shroud of night’s darkness, so nobody noticed their elegance and the aura of expensive carriage blazing through the village road--of which was surprisingly wide for a settlement road, unlike road of cities in the western kingdoms, because long ago Mossack people needed to endure monster stampedes passing through their villages once every few months.</p>\n<p>“Mom, look, is that a noble?” a snotty kid pointing out the carriage.</p>\n<p>The mother hurriedly pulled her child. “Ssuuussh! Keep your finger to yourself! Don’t you know what happened to peasants that make noble angry from the stories they always talking about?”</p>\n<p>The steel-armored guards who escort the carriage scoffed them in disdain. Contrast with the escorts’ attitudes, Lyla waved her hand at them, while shouting, “Hey boy, don’t you think bunnies are cute as the kitties? Or do you like cats more?”</p>\n<p>The kid didn’t answer. He instead forced to bow by her mother and let the carriage went through silently. The villagers didn’t have the experience in receiving nobles, most of them--except for those who attended the ngajen ceremony in Malikh Family--had never saw nobles in their lives. Because of that they were awkward and didn’t know what to do.</p>\n<p>Lyla didn’t seem to mind their stiffness. Instead, she vigorously greeted everyone she saw from the window she sat on.</p>\n<p>“Good day! Good morning! I’m here to sleepover at Sis Bhela’s place! Do you know where Sis Bhela lives?”</p>\n<p>Back in Elzhier Family, in the main family’s house, their patriarch, hurriedly changed his clothes to a formal one he always used every ngajen ceremony.</p>\n<p>“Hurry, hurry! As the head of this village, how can I let a noble arriving without me receiving them?!”</p>\n<p>Not even he yet buttoned his shirt properly, the Village Head sprinted toward the main street, only to see the crowd of onlookers already dispersed and still talking about the scary nobles they always heard in stories were actually <em>weirdly</em> friendly.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Bhela Malikh was already notified about Lyla Blackwood’s arrival. She waited on a chair at the Malikh Family’s gate, drinking a fresh young coconut water occasionally. The black carriage finally was in her view. And the young girl she was waiting for happily waved her hand at her. From the window.</p>\n<p>“Carefull, Lyla!” Bhela yelled as she sprang from her chair.</p>\n<p>“Huuupp!” Lyla Blackwood simply didn’t want to waste anytime leaving the carriage through the door. So she simply jumped from the window she sat upon, before the carriage even stopped. It was fortunate that amongst Bhela’s skill as a Unique Class, she had <b>Haste</b>, which boosted her speed in short duration. She used that to catch Lyla before she hurt herself. The young noble girl landed splendidly in Bhela’s arm.</p>\n<p>“What’s this, Sistah?” Lyla’s eyes sparkled when she saw Bhela get a young coconut in her other hand. She was completely oblivious she just did something dangerous.</p>\n<p>“Young coconut. There’s still some of its water left. Here, try this,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“For me? Really?”</p>\n<p>“Drink slowly…”</p>\n<p><em>Glug glug glug</em>. Lyla drank the coconut in anything but in slowly manner. She even burped shamelessly.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Lyla, ah!” the butler who coming with her was in horror seeing how Young Lady Lyla Blackwood made a horrible mess by spilling the coconut water on her expensive, silk woven black dress. Only an equally expensive silk handkerchief worthy enough to wipe his young lady’s noble dress!</p>\n<p>“I told you to drink slowly…” Bhela said. She used her sleeve to wipe Lyla’s wet face, and then proceeded to also wipe Lyla’s dress.</p>\n<p>“Y-young miss!” the butler shouted in panic. His body jolted as soon as he saw the outrageous act of spoiling the young noble’s dress by making it contacted with commoner clothes. That was heresy! He needed her to stop before she contained Blackwood’s expensive dress with her commoner’s bacteria!</p>\n<p>“You need something?” Bhela looked at this unfamiliar butler of Blackwood Family. Her expressionless face judged the butler coldly.</p>\n<p>“My name is Tim, young miss--please use this!” the butler offered a silky smooth handkerchief with Blackwood Family’s crest embroidered on the surface. The handkerchief was actually the butler’s, was awarded to his great-great-great grandfather by the then Baron Blackwood for some sort of achievement that practically nobody was still alive to remember. Everytime Butler Tim met a new person, he’d make an excuse to show off this particular handkerchief. Today was no exception. It was his most precious handkerchief. Just from the look of it one could tell how crazy expensive it was.</p>\n<p>“Ah, ah… my nose… aahhh--” Lyla felt her nose was wet and itchy, “--ahhtchii!!!”</p>\n<p>“You’ve got a flu?” Bhela asked worriedly.</p>\n<p>“Yeah. Aunt Jiji told me to drink my medicine everyday but it’s so bitter. So much bitter that it’s evil!”</p>\n<p>“Where’s your medicine now?”</p>\n<p>“Oh. I throw it away last night.”</p>\n<p>Bhela shook her head.</p>\n<p>“That’s no good. You can’t throw away your medicine like that. Now, wipe your nose. This mister butler said to use this…” she put the handkerchief on Lyla’s nose, and Lyla blew her nose on it.</p>\n<p>Lyla gave back the handkerchief to Butler Tim. “Thank you, Sir Butler. It’s very helpful of you.”</p>\n<p>The butler received back his most precious handkerchief. Bonus Lyla’s snot.</p>\n<p>“Come on inside,” Bhela said to Lyla. “Even if the water runs dry, coconuts still have meat we can scoop. After that we’ll pick some star fruits that I planted since I was a child.”</p>\n<p>“Star fruits! Woohooo!”</p>\n<p>The girls then walked inside. Lyla was so excited she didn’t leave her friend, hanging on her neck like a koala being comfortable on a tree branch. The stories about a noble young lady coming to Malikh Family for Bhela Malikh spread amongst the maidservants like oil being poured on an open wildfire. The Malikhs couldn’t describe the pride seeing their eldest young lady with a blue blood friend. Especially the aunties. They watched how close Bhela and Lyla with teary eyes and happy smiles.</p>\n<p>“Young lady is… finally… finally…”</p>\n<p>“She finally has a friend…”</p>\n<p>“Huuu… huuu… merciful Goddesses finally saw the young lady’s plight and blessed her with a real friend… huuu huuuu….”</p>\n<p>Nobody more happier than the aunties who were familiar with how their Young Lady Bhela lived her live. They silently cried watching their young lady, who usually alone and unapproachable, finally grown up and had her first friend in these past ten years.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Butler Tim grimaced inside. Despite the fact that he was tasked to win over Bhela Malikh with any means necessary, he didn’t like this girl. It wasn’t because his handkerchief got dirty--well, maybe he resented her for it a little--it because the girl named Bhela Malikh wasn’t acting as a young country girl supposed to act. Country bumpkins supposed to falter when they saw the radiance seeped out of the nobles’ aura, they supposed to tremble when they saw the noble wealth glittering beneath the sun. But this girl was indifferent and aloof. She was cold but the coldness paired with concise and elegant mannerism. Butler Tim knew she trying to act noble herself. That was why he didn’t like her.</p>\n<p>However, Butler Tim was a smart person. Any smart person would wear a perfect smile despite his heart bleeding over the snot on his precious handkerchief. Before leaving the city, the butler didn’t forget to look for a gift he’d use to lower the Malikh Family’s guard. He heard the previous gift was rejected, and when he asked for the content of the gift, the smart Butler Tim shook his head as if he knew it would happen.</p>\n<p>Toward country bumpkins, too expensive gifts would never work. He knew this because he was smart. And because he was smart, he knew better gifts. Not-so-expensive gifts worked for country bumpkins.</p>\n<p>Therefore, he presented Bhela Malikh with popular city biscuits.</p>\n<p>“I heard this biscuit is currently very popular among noble young ladies. This butler happened to pass by a store that sold this, so I reckon Young Lady Bhela might love to taste some.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, because the elders roughly knew the Blackwood Family’s youngest lady would come to visit, two leaders of opposing factions came to watch how their Young Lady Bhela would receive the noble guest. Elder Jhamil was all smiling because he liked what he saw. But the expression of Elder Khasim turned sour when he saw how the butler of Blackwood Family tried to butter up to Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>“Don’t accept it, young lady, please….” Elder Khasim whispered under his breath. Of course, there was no single soul heard what he just said. He was worried the hard work to rebuild his faction’s morale all would turn into dust if people thought their spiritual mascot, the one and only Young Lady Bhela Malikh, could be bought with mere biscuits.</p>\n<p>Contrary to what Elder Khasim hoped, Bhela Malikh received the gift without even putting a second thought. A feeling of defeat surged inside him. Elder Jhamil looked at his rival with a mocking glance.</p>\n<p>After receiving the snacks, Bhela excused herself and brought Lyla with her to stroll around Malikh Family’s gardens. Butler Tim pretended to wave his hand and smiled, but inside, he was gloating at how hypocrite Bhela was. His guess that Young Lady Bhela wouldn’t refuse the gift he brought was entirely correct. Before, he deliberately said the biscuit was noble young ladies’ favorite. Thus, according to his smart logic, as long as it wasn’t too expensive that it’d scare this fake young lady, no way a noble wannabe would reject this kind of gifts.</p>\n<p>“Heh,” Butler Tim scoffed when Bhela and Lyla already left. “Bet you’ve never eaten any city biscuits your entire life, haven’t you.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, Bhela Malikh hadn’t had any city biscuits her entire life. Not before and also not today. What Butler Tim didn’t know was that the snacks he bought with his own money ultimately ended up returned to Blackwood Family--to be exact, it ended up inside Lyla Blackwood’s belly. Bhela couldn’t help but received the biscuits when, beside her, she saw Lyla was drooling looking at the biscuits.</p>\n<p>The elders led by Elder Jhamil then respectfully welcomed the butler along with servants and guards from Blackwood Family. From the impression alone, Butler Tim could see reasons for him to like this slick-tongued Elder Jhamil. He knew how to flatter and also he knew how to act humble in front of people with higher status than him. Not like that noble-wannabe Young Lady of Malikh Family. This Elder Jhamil knew that he was only a country bumpkin thus acted accordingly. Naturally, the smart Butler Tim was pleased.</p>\n<p>And so began Butler Tim’s quests to swallow Malikh Family with his smartly planned schemes and cunning political games.</p>\n<p>In mere hours, the neutral elders who hadn’t joined either both rivalling factions began flocking to Elder Jhamil’s side. One part because they wanted to side with the faction that had the noble support and another part simply because Elder Jhamil, with the help of Butler Tim, had been throwing around sweet deals over all directions.</p>\n<p>“Only one tenth of the elder council members don’t want to pick a side by now, but their number is too significant to be an obstacle for Sir Butler’s great plan,” Elder Jhamil reported the current situation to Butler Tim.</p>\n<p>The butler was enjoying a glass of tea served by the maid that supposed to serve Young Lady Lyla Blackwood as if he was the visiting noble himself. He nodded. “I see. With this, the first stage of my plan has been completed.”</p>\n<p>“Oohhh!” Elder Jhamil exclaimed. “Sir Butler summoned rain and fire by flipping Malikh Family’s political scene upside down, and this is only the first stage?! As expected, the Butler of Blackwood Family is very smart!”</p>\n<p>Butler Tim originally wanted to act aloof and sophisticated before he visited this rural village. However, upon being called a smart person, he couldn’t help but grinned widely. “Oho, you’re an interesting fella, aren’t you? Very well, since you’ve done a good job yourself, I won’t be so petty to grab all the credit. Tell me how I should do next, if I like what I hear, we might as well corporate your thoughts into my plan.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was excited. How could he not? An opportunity to rise beyond a mere elder of rural village was laid before him.</p>\n<p>“Sir Butler, you may not know this, but we Mossack people regard having a good meal very highly. Everytime we’re having breakfast or dinner together as the entire family, even though we’re always looked peaceful outside, those trivial events actually are a political battlefield for us elders to extend our influence! This lowly man himself used a few move in the past during breakfast to gather like-minded men under my banner. I used all my resources and connections in a single mealtime to attack my rivals! However, these past two days, my biggest rival used a lowly method against me…”</p>\n<p>“Oh? What did he do?” Butler Tim asked.</p>\n<p>“He didn’t do much,” Elder Jhamil said, sneering when he was talking about this rival of his, “all he did was inviting Young Lady Bhela everytime we were having a meal in the family hall. He’s been a stubborn and ignorant supporter of main family, but this time he actually knew how to use his connection with the main family to deal a blow against me. A few of the elders had been faltering when they saw Young Lady Bhela leaning over the other side; I’m afraid if we’re leaving this ignorant rival of me doing as he wanted, there’s gonna be a hole in Sir Butler’s smart plan!”</p>\n<p>Butler Tim swirled the tea in his cup as though he was deep in thought. Of course, if this proven to endanger his smart plan, the butler couldn’t sit still watching all that happened. “I heard the Mossacks are peculiar people, but I don’t know you Mossack people have a strange custom!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, we’re living here far away from the city, so of course our traditions might seem unsophisticated to wise westerners like Sir Butler,” Elder Jhamil fawned.</p>\n<p>“Then what do you suggest Blackwood Family should do in this situation, Elder Jhamil?”</p>\n<p>“It’s easy!” Elder Jhamil was so excited he almost jumped from his seat. “My rival faction used Young Lady Bhela to gain foothold, and we can also use that to deal a greater blow back to them!”</p>\n<p>“And that is?”</p>\n<p>“Of course, we can use--I mean, we can invite young noble miss to a dinner together with us. With this we can unofficially announce our alliance with Blackwood Family! It’s the final nail to main family’s faction!”</p>\n<p>Even though Bhela Malikh’s status as a Unique Class shone throughout all of Badril Village, her name still fall short with a pure noble like Lyla Blackwood. Madam back in Blackwood Family used her daughter so Blackwood could infiltrate Malikh Family easily, but that didn’t mean Lyla still wasn’t as useful.</p>\n<p>“Very well. Let us go with that,” then he asked the maid responsible for Lyla’s schedule. “What was Young Lady Lyla doing this afternoon?”</p>\n<p>The maid replied, “Young Lady Bhela Malikh carried her around to play. At first, they went to Malikh Family’s orchard to pick some fruits. Then they visited the sick Patriarch Malikh in his room for a few minutes. After that, they went outside to stroll and came back with a new rabbit pet they bought from other family. Finally, when the sun is setting, they went to the kitchen to watch the servants cooking.”</p>\n<p>“How uncouth for a noble young lady being led around in dirty places like that,” Butler Tim was displeased, but nothing he could do since making Bhela’s attention elsewhere meant he could move freely to make a trap for her. Nodding to himself, the butler then gave an instruction to the maid, “you go to Young Lady Lyla and tell that Malikh Family invite her for a dinner.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was excitedly rubbing his hands when Butler Tim said that. Finally, payback to those imbecile Elder Khasim!</p>\n<p>“But, Butler Tim…” the maid hesitated.</p>\n<p>“What is it?”</p>\n<p>“Malikh Family already invited Young Lady Lyla to have dinner. She’s eating in Malikh Family’s hall right now….”</p>\n<p>“Hmm, what do you mean?”</p>\n<p>What the maid meant was that someone in Malikh Family already brought Lyla to have dinner with them.</p>\n<p>When Butler Tim playing political games and scheming around in Malikh Family, Bhela Malikh, along with the elders friendly with Elder Khasim, had been giving bunch of candies and food for Lyla Blackwood, much more than the biscuits Butler Tim brought with him. Being a great foodie herself, Lyla never had enough, the first day in Malikh Family she ate more sweets and foods worth of one week back in Blackwood Family’s manor. Aunt Jiji and other Blackwood Family’s maid servants would freak out if they saw how glutton Lyla currently was.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the news that the main family’s faction hosting a dinner for a noble miss swept Malikh Family like a thunderstorm. The neutral elders Elder Jhamil had just bought flocking back toward Elder Khasim’s side. It was so sudden. Everyone wasn’t even got a breath to process what had happened. And this for sure was an unprecedented move ever since Patriarch Ghalim suddenly fell ill and retreated from the political scene.</p>\n<p>Just as one side was busy completing the first stage to win over the Young Lady of Malikh Family, the other side already won over Young Lady of the noble Blackwood Family. All happened in a span of a single day.</p>\n<p>“Y-young Lady Lyla…”</p>\n<p>Even Butler Tim couldn’t pull his own young miss seeing how happy she was. His plan had been jabbed in a completely unexpected way. Maybe he wasn’t so smart after all.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>It was unfortunate that Madam Malikh didn’t see the Young Noble Miss of Blackwood Family kindly. Even though the girl did nothing wrong, Madam Malikh wasn’t so muddled that she wasn’t aware what Blackwood Family and those corrupt elders conspiring against her husband and Malikh’s main family. Even Bhela herself couldn’t do anything to change her mother’s mind.</p>\n<p>However, Lyla Blackwood, an airhead as she always was, was oblivious of the hostility directed toward her.</p>\n<p>It was morning the second day Lyla in Badril Village. Following her friend Bhela, she carried a little box inside Patriarch Ghalim’s bedroom. This little box filled with custom-made medicines--most were amateurly mixed from two different trivial medicines, consisted of remedies for flu and headache. Nothing harmful but nothing useful at the same time. And just like yesterday, to pay for Bhela parents’ kindness for letting her staying in Malikh Family, Lyla Blackwood decided to play doctor a little bit.</p>\n<p>“Uncle, I’m coming again to help you feel better,” Lyla said as she dragged a chair and sat beside Patriarch Ghalim’s sick bed. Seeing the pale middle-aged man in bed, she blinked her googly eyes, then continued, “how’s yesterday medicine I gave you. Are you feeling a tiny minny bit better, perhaps?”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim certainly was feeling better these past few days, not because Lyla’s medicines, but Grandpa Piss’s diagnosis and remedies. Toward this girl, he weakly nodded. “Thank you for your help, little lady.”</p>\n<p>“Then I’m going to fed you my newest recipe, uncle. Here, here, open your mouth.”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghamil did what he was told. Because Lyla didn’t like bitter medicine, she added lots of brown sugar. Lots and lots of brown sugar.</p>\n<p>“It’s… sweet.”</p>\n<p>“Are you feeling better, now?” Lyla asked.</p>\n<p>“Yes, little lady, I’m feeling better.”</p>\n<p>As a matter of fact, he wasn’t. The medicine was more like a candy than remedy.</p>\n<p>“Good! If you eat this three times a day, maybe your illness would go away, uncle,” Lyla then sternly pointed out, “maybe!”</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh was nervous when her husband consumed the strange medicine Lyla gave him, but she didn’t open her mouth to protest. Bhela was changing the pillows’ sheet nearby, and doing some other chores that usually were done by the servants. In the meantime, Lyla was giving advice for Patriarch Ghalim liked how he should eat moderately three times a day, how he should brush his teeth after he ate sweets, and all the things Aunt Jiji told Lyla all the time.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to visit again, uncle, get well soon!” Lyla waved her hands. Carrying a broom in her hands, Lyla’s next schedule was following Bhela doing chores in the courtyard.</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim weakly waved his hand back. Of course, after the girls were already gone, he noticed his bitter wife biting her lips indignantly.</p>\n<p>“Don’t stare the girl so much. She’s not responsible for her family’s wrongdoings. It’s not like a girl her age knows what her parents do behind the scene.”</p>\n<p>“Why did you eat that? What if they used her to give you more poison?”</p>\n<p>“Bhela wouldn’t let me have the medicine if she didn’t what it was, no? Stop putting that kind of face, you only make our daughter feels awkward about all this.”</p>\n<p>The woman held her husband’s hand, kissing it with her forehead as she hid her face. She whispered, “Oh, don’t you know how hurt this heart holding back my grievance? Why did our daughter had to bring someone from that family inside our roof?” she sniffed, “how long this farce gonna last? What should I do in the mean time? Oh! I don’t know! I don’t know!”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim sighed as he witnessed his wife cried helplessly.</p>\n<p>In the courtyard, near the coops where Malikh Family raised chickens and ducks, Lyla was squatting in front of the new bunny she and Bhela bought just yesterday. She was waiting the whole morning just to feed this bunny. The bunny hopped around, itching to play in spite it couldn’t resist the temptation of delicious green leaves, again and again. Wathing how glutton the bunny was, Lyla found herself immerse in immense joy. She very much envying the life of a bunny. Perhaps that because she could relate to how it spent its day without worry; eating, playing, sleeping, then playing again--a life that she longed to have. If only she was born a rabbit instead of a young lady of noble family….</p>\n<p>The sound of the broom swept the ground took away her attention. Lyla couldn’t understand how a daughter of a patriarch like Bhela had to work so much.</p>\n<p>“Why do you work so much, Sistah?” Lyla asked when she found out there still much dry leaves Bhela had to sweep. “Won’t you get bored soon? Just let the servants clean this place.”</p>\n<p>Bhela, sweeping as if Lyla’s idleness didn’t bother her the slightest, replied, “Here in Badril Village, everyone who hasn’t done their coming of age ceremony has to do chores for their parents. It doesn’t matter if it’s the farmer’s daughter or the biggest family’s young lady, helping the matter of the household is one of the seven virtues we Mossack people get to do for our parents.”</p>\n<p>Originally, Lyla wanted her friend also playing with the bunny. But hearing Bhela just said something serious, there was no way she’d reveal her intention now. “My mom always nagging me to go to dance lesson or whatever. It’s very very boring,” she murmured, a bit dejected.</p>\n<p>“The west and the south have different values,” Bhela said. “Complete your virtue for your parents then you’ll grow to be a fine lady, Lyla.”</p>\n<p>“Uggghhh…” Lyla grunted as she didn’t want to continue the topic any further. She long developed a sense for her own survival to detect whether or not the conversation ended up she being forced to do some boring stuff. Knowing Bhela’s personality, Lyla knew soon Sis Bhela’d make her doing chores too. Grabbing the bunny, Lyla quickly escaped somewhere else so that she could spend her time playing. Bhela shook her head seeing the girl’s behavior.</p>\n<p>Bhela then noticed some servants whispering while they looking at Lyla from the distance. Many people were curious what a noble young lady like her would do in a rural place like this, and Bhela wasn’t that oblivious not to notice the eyes planted by the elders of Malikh Family.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, she then saw four girls dressed in expensive garments approaching Lyla with their mouth covered with feathered fans in their hands. Their clothing looked as if they attending some sort of ceremony, while in fact, they calculated that this kind of appearance was the most suitable for them to socialize with a girl of blue-blooded origin. Bhela recognized the leader of those girls was actually Elder Jhamil’s niece.</p>\n<p>“Have you read Le Armour dan Varoza written by Leornador De Gonzalez, Young Lady Blackwood?”</p>\n<p>“Ah, yes, that piece was adequately sophisticated but I think Vista van Gracious’s omnibus more than adequate, le banjour?”</p>\n<p>“I see, I see, their pieces adequately well-written as those senor themselves adequattely live as maestro. But perhaps equoliette more than fit the diagram as paradigm sensorita abligioate senor des adequately le banjour.”</p>\n<p>“But of course, Young Lady Blackwood is more addequately sophisitacted as it’s a noblesse obligiote to be more sohpisitacated than us village senioritas. Perhaps le banjour is fortuna with de gracious by Young Lady’s great wisdom?”</p>\n<p>Lyla blinked her eyes trying to decipher whatever these girls mean. The bunny in her arms even escaped amidst her confusion.</p>\n<p>“Uhh… uhhh…” Lyla timidly stepped back from the feathered fan girls. “I think Sis Bhela is calling me…”</p>\n<p>She swiftly ran away back to her friend Bhela.</p>\n<p>“Sistah, Sistah Bhela!” Lyla cried and grabbing Bhela’s sloven sleeve tightly, demanding for justice, “they came to bully me!”</p>\n<p>“What did they do?” Bhela asked.</p>\n<p>“They know I can’t speak western language! They came to test me! They’re even worse than those rich girls in seminar--they jumble some western mumbo jumbo into plain language in order to confuse me! They must be laughing and call me stupid by now!”</p>\n<p>Hearing Lyla’s grievance, Bhela patted her head in order to let the girl calmed down.</p>\n<p>“Lyla, those girls are different than the noble girls that always making fun of you.”</p>\n<p>“Different? How so?”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at the girls who also was watching them back while fanning themselves with their fabulous feathered fans.</p>\n<p>“They looked like noble descendants, but actually were not.”</p>\n<p>“I still don’t like them nonetheless!”</p>\n<p>“You don’t have to talk to them if you don’t want to,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>Yet Lyla still restlessly tugging Bhela’s sleeves, making it harder for her to do her chores. Before the peers that always making fun of her, Lyla was always helpless and had been depending on Bhela’s figure as a shield. What it looked like from the point of view of an outsider was a scene where a young mother being tested of her patience dealing with a girl who was throwing a tantrum.</p>\n<p>Seeing that the young noble miss wouldn’t come back soon, the feathered fan girls approaching Bhela and Lyla instead.</p>\n<p>“Oh, fancy to meet Young Lady Bhela here, le banjour!”</p>\n<p>“Le bonjour…” Bhela hesitated to reply back. Tilting her head slightly, she studied the pompously dressed girls before her. These girls were relatives of Malikh Family’s elders. None of them could match with Bhela if talking strictly about social status wise, not to mention talents. However, while she was holding her broom, it looked like Bhela was the one with common origin, while these girls were floating swans who happened to be generous enough to greet plebeians with their <em>unique</em> vocabulary.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Lyla Blackwood hid behind Lyla’s back. Despite a noble origin herself, meeting more cocky and fake young ladies than the girls before her were rare experience for Lyla.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela, fancy to meet you. Good morning. The weather is nice. I eat snails everyday,” Elder Jhamil’s niece took the lead and said that with a hint of inflated pride.</p>\n<p>Bhela narrowed her eyes. She could see why Lyla instantly hated these girls. She then said in a sleek foreign language, “Je ne sais pas de quoi tu parles. Si vous ne parlez pas une langue étrangère, fermez simplement la bouche, sinon vous faites peur aux enfants avec votre non-sens.”</p>\n<p>The feathered fan girls blinked their eyes trying to decipher whatever Bhela had said.</p>\n<p>“Oh, it turns out Young Lady Bhela is aquadettely know some le banjour!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, Young Lady Bhela is adequately sophisticated after all. Me gusta!”</p>\n<p>“I see, I see, le pasta fortuna is delicosaza.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s niece didn’t say anything as she only maintained a sweet smile while being nervous herself. Racking her brains over remembering the contents of thick dictionary, she tried to form a decent sentences in foreign language. But Bhela then cut off her train of thought before she could say a word.</p>\n<p>“Blackwood Family is migrating noble that has long been making their roots here in southern land. Hundred of years living far away from their western peers, noble families like this would naturally become more lax. It’s natural for Lyla to not mastering her homeland’s native tongue.”</p>\n<p>Bhela said that in a straight manner. That was a white lie, however. It was true that many noble families coming from the western side of Tiramikal Continent to forgot their western root and began to see themselves as southerners. But those were usually the case depending right circumstances, like exiled nobles, or some young masters who had lost in political battle branched out and fancied themselves a legit noble family with themselves at the helm. Blackwood Family weren’t exiled nobles, and though Lyla’s ancestors branching out some hundreds of years ago, that didn’t automatically made them cutting off ties with the original family. The main family of Blackwood was back in a western country called Tatalghia Kingdom, still sending letters and envoys from time to time to the branch Lyla was living in--although, undeniably, the southern branch of Blackwood Family had long developed and surpassed the main one.</p>\n<p>It seemed like Bhela already used to tell this lie. Anyone who heard this would be forced to accept it, unless they wanted to spend time and resources digging through the details--which to be honest, none of these pompous young girls were willing or simply unable to go through.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Elder Jhamil’s niece believed Lyla’s family exempt her to excel in foreign language. Yet she was still displeased inside. Her uncle told her that Bhela had been hogging the young noble’s influence for herself, everyone in Malikh Family already knew how Bhela Malikh carrying around the noble young lady yesterday. So what if she had some more bit of talent and had been running around overseas in that whatever seminars she was attending? A bumpkin origin wouldn’t be able to change their bumpkin bloodline. So if Bhela had the right to get close with the Young Lady of Blackwood Family, that meant someone coming from the same family should have the same change as her!</p>\n<p>The elder’s niece said, “Young Lady Bhela, I know the main family is prideful. But Young Lady Blackwood is here to experience the village slow life. Don’t you think she also needs to mingle with us commoners?”</p>\n<p>“Lyla will befriend any person she fancies herself, I don’t control with whom she wants to socialize with,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“If that’s the case, then why she still has no friends other than you?”</p>\n<p>“That’s not true!” Lyla cried indignantly, “I’ve made friends! With aunties! Aunties in the kitchen!”</p>\n<p>It was easy to be friendly with Lyla. She was always unconventional and never saw people by the social system. To her, people only divided by two types, those who gave her food and those who didn’t. She was like a cat. Just bring a good food and she’d be very friendly the next moment.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Lyla’s frank open-mindedness wasn’t easily accepted by some people. Elder Jhamil’s niece gasped as she looked at Lyla and Bhela, back and forth. “My goodness! Young Lady Bhela, were you letting a noble young lady such as Young Lady Blackwood mingle with dirty servants?!”</p>\n<p>“Why wouldn’t I?” Bhela asked back.</p>\n<p>“You--don’t young lady care about our family’s reputation? What if people said we’ve mistreated a noble young lady?”</p>\n<p>“Lyla is here to experience village slow life,” Bhela said slowly, “don’t you think she also needs to mingle with commoners?”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s niece was speechless as Bhela used her own words. The contorted expression on her chaky make-up face brought satisfaction for Lyla, who then snorted.</p>\n<p>“What now? Kitty got your tongue?” Lyla said with her mouth pouted. “So that you know, Sis Bhela already made speechless many many bullies like you! Who were many many many times smarter than you! This is what you get by making fun of me--shame on you, hmph! Who’s the stupid one, now?”</p>\n<p>Even after losing a round of squabble against Young Lady Bhela, unexpectedly the nobly young lady herself became hostile against her. All was so sudden that it made blood drained from her face.</p>\n<p>Bhela ruffled Lyla’s hair. Apparently Lyla still believed these girls came to bully her. When Lyla already made up her mind to not liking someone, it was hard to bend on her opinion.</p>\n<p>“Let’s go, Lyla. We’ll help aunties make sweets for afternoon lunch,” Bhela said. Back in the seminars, when Bhela asked Lyla to do some chores, the supposed noble young lady of Blackwood Family would move slowly, occasionally pouting and murmuring some complaints, unwilling to exert her calories on some boring stuff. However, it was different if the destination was kitchen. The spirit of lively bunny would come to possess her--she’d jolt, sprinting, unwilling to waste time as the promise of free sweets and delicious salty snacks was revealed before her.</p>\n<p>“What was that about?!” one of the le bonjour girls scowled after Bhela and Lyla was gone. “How could a young lady speaks like that?”</p>\n<p>“Bhela must lead her around to act like that! Did you hear what she said? The noble young lady thinks we bully her or something.”</p>\n<p>“Aahhh! What a manipulative bitch! I really want to know what that little cunt said to make Young Lady Blackwood think we had made fun of her. No way in hell someone would dare making fun of a noble like her!”</p>\n<p>Actually, Lyla was made fun of so many times. Especially during her study in the seminars abroad. She made fun of so much that she formed a survival instinct to hide behind Bhela’s back. But they didn’t know that. They just assumed as a young lady coming from a noble family, Lyla Blackwood would be adequately pure noble in stories and gossip. The main reason Bhela brought Lyla away was so that Lyla didn’t have to mingle with these delusional le bonjour girls.</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-2/chapter-1-5":"<p>A fifteen years old boy played a game of chess against a spirit. Yesterday, he won a ghastly old encyclopedia nobody ever heard of. Today, the bet he eyed was silver coins. He didn’t know what he wanted from his opponent for tomorrow’s game. But the spirit in this dashing leather armor, adventurer-style, always wanted one thing for the game’s prize: taking control of the boy’s mortal body.</p>\n<p>More than a hundred games of chess later, the boy still got his healthy body intact, he never lost even once. And that made the spirit grow more dissatisfied as the days passing by.</p>\n<p>“Holy ff--! I clearly remember this damn bishop wasn’t there,” the spirit said. From the look of it, he was two moves away from getting his king owned.</p>\n<p>The boy clicked his tongue. He was hearing that kind of excuse every time the chess game came to its end.</p>\n<p>The spirit stubbornly closed the gap in his defense by sacrificing a rook. But soon, without taking a time to think, the boy casually moved his one horse, eating away the queen, sealing all the chance for the spirit to counter-attack.</p>\n<p>“Fuck this shit!!!”</p>\n<p>Enraged, the spirit flipped the chess board. About a dozen chess pieces hurled all side as they became the victims of the spirit’s frustration. The boy sighed. This was no good. Apparently he needed to be more considerate for the next game. He needed to pretend struggling before he crushed this impatient spirit so he didn’t feel cornered and ended up abandoning all these easy-money making games.</p>\n<p>“Hey,” the boy said. He tapped the flat-surfaced stone they used to lay the chess board before and reminded the spirit, almost as if he was saying “put the money here.”</p>\n<p>As annoyed as he was, the spirit could do nothing but give him a pouch of coins.</p>\n<p>“They are not kobes,” the boy said. “Shops and stalls in the village only accept kobe coins.”</p>\n<p>The spirit scoffed.</p>\n<p>“What do you know about it, brat. If you convert with the last week rate then you’ve got twice the shitty kobe you extort from me. Be glad about it.”</p>\n<p>“This won’t do, Ol’ Nalaq. The peddlers that come around here rarely accept strange currency. Neighbor country’s money is usually fine but I don’t think these coins would do. I don’t even know which country these coins are from.”</p>\n<p>“Then use it to add your savings,” the spirit said. “And don’t call me Nalaq. Don’t push your primitive tribal nonsense to me. Call me ‘Good-Natured Spirit’ as usual. I’m not like your usual Nalaqs, brat.”</p>\n<p>“It’s not tribal.” The boy didn’t show any sign of agreement. He didn’t know why this roguish-grinning spirit didn’t like to be called a Nalaq. The way southern Mossack people, like the boy himself, addressed spirits were usually by two terms: Nalaq and Selaq. As far as he knew Nalaq was a title worth to be proud of.</p>\n<novel-trivia label=”Lore”>\n<p>Nalaq were those of the spirit of fallen heroes and mages, had attained high-level of enlightenment to see ways to preserve souls across death. Whilst no longer to be alive, Nalaqs own their consciousness and retain their memories as well intelligence, though part of their original power diminished, especially those who relied on physical might during their prime.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Selaqs arose from death through unnatural causes, sometimes fueled by resentment and great energy of negativity. Though more powerful, their spirit didn’t dissipate because of strong, usually vile, emotions their harbour when they died, the restless spirits stuck in the limbo and returned back to the mortal world as hostile, mindless haunting spectres.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>Theoretically the spirit that currently playing chess was a Nalaq. He still got his consciousness, true. But, in a way, his intelligence seemed way apart from the Nalaqs southern Mossack tribes often revered in the past--that was what the boy had in mind when looking at this vulgar grinning spirit.</p>\n<p>“You’re not thinking something stupid about me, are you?” the spirit said with a snort as he realized the unexcited eyes the boy had as if he was looking at cow dung.</p>\n<p>“No, I was thinking just the usual--I was wondering about your very existence and your real identity.”</p>\n<p>“That so?” the spirit raised his chin. “Don’t need overthinking it, boy. Hehe. If you know even a piece of my name then you’d be amazed by how amazing I am. Everybody is my bitch when I’m still your age back then, hehe. That’s true.”</p>\n<p>“Hooohhh…” the boy half-heartedly nodded. As expected, every time he brought the topic about the spirit’s identity, all he got was empty talks, disgusting enough for him to regret for bringing up the topic. For now, the only joyous thing he got to do was counting the money he won from the chess game as the bullshit Good-Natured Spirit sang about his past tuning endlessly in the background.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Somewhere in Tiramikal Continent, far in the opposite side of the cold, barbaric northern lands, not too isolated from the bustling early-capitalistic empires of the western lands, and not too far away from the neighbor eastern lands of never-ending warfares between the eastern Kaya feudal lords, a village known as Badril Village was living peaceful for a number of years. The old blood the locals knew as Badril Village’s three big families rooted deeply these past one hundred years in spite of the thinning southern Mossack heritage. Despite slowly developing their rural village worthy of the westerner tourists and easterners refugees, the southern locals still taking pride in their Mossack hunters and gatherers ancestry. Exactly one year ago Good-Natured Spirit appeared in this humble village.󠆞</p>\n<p>On the wall of Yashura Family’s courtyard, which was ridiculously thick and tall for ordinary villages, the spirit took out a rolled paper of dried tobacco. This might not be common knowledge known only to limited people; for converting earthly materials to spiritual goods for Nalaqs to use, it could only be done in an expensive and complicated manner--usually performed in rituals by the royalties and great ancient clans for annual offerings to their ancestors. But the spirit in shabby leather armor did the converting for cigarettes and other trivial goods. Nobody knew how he did it. Even if they did, it’d be very hard to judge whether his quirk was worth to be admired or to be ridiculed at. Nevertheless he got this kind of air around him that telling people he didn’t care much about what they think.</p>\n<p>The street below the wall were children below ages of ten playing with sticks and chasing each other. When a crowd of housewives came, his eyes, sharp as an eagle’s, sweeping through in search of prey. One of his habit that obviously he brought with him since he was alive was to oogle women, especially for young wives and pretty middle-aged aunties interesting big breasts and interesting big butts. Despite his sighing and occasional annoying tongue-clicking, though, those wives and children didn’t turn their heads toward him. They didn’t even know a lecher ghost was there haunting the street. A Nalaq couldn’t be seen by common folks by default. Unless he wanted to, no one would realize there was a suspicious spirit ogling for women that were passing by.</p>\n<p>There was a young woman he knew trotted the street. Good-Natured Spirit knew her. She was neither a wife nor she was an aunty. Her butt and breasts sizes were also not worth being fusing about. The name was Mila Yashura, seventeen years old since last month. She was the older cousin of the boy he lost playing chess to.</p>\n<p>“Aunty,” Mila greeted an aunty by lowering her head, “did you see my cousin Shira around here?”</p>\n<p>The local wife she asked shook her head. Mila Yashura said a polite thanks and continued searching for her cousin.</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit swept the street with his eyes, looking for something. When he saw a certain manservant he stopped. Using his spiritual knife, he dismantled a small pebble from the stone wall he sat on, flicked it using his thumb and knocked the manservant’s head with it.</p>\n<p>“Ouch!” the manservant cried.</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura abruptly turned her head and saw a manservant of her Yashura Family holding his head. She briskly coming to him and asked the same question she threw to the aunty before.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira?” the manservant glanced at the direction of the hill behind Yashura Family’s wall. “I saw him walking there at noon. But whether he has returned or not I don’t know.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you. That’s good enough. Here, treat yourself some coffee beans before the peddlers set for the next village.”</p>\n<p>The hill behind the Yashura Family’s dwelling was originally a place where the family members brought the family’s goats to graze its green grasses. But under the current patriarch’s management, the family’s fortunate mostly put on investing on coconut plantations, thus some grazing places were left unused.</p>\n<p>“Shira! So here’s you holing yourself. I’ve been searching you for nearly an hour,” Mila saw how her cousin who was two years younger than her enjoying himself lying under a shadowy tree, using his arms as pillows. She kicked his foot, yelling him to get up, but Shira merely changed his position and groaned in protest.</p>\n<p>“This buffon…” Mila hissed. “You know how the fact you’re lazing around everyday breeds all those crappy rumors, don’t you?”</p>\n<p>“People can talk whatever they want as long as they don’t bother me,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“But they bother our family!”</p>\n<p>Mila inhaling a deep breath. Now her voice getting higher annoyingly and she continued, “You’re the young master of our family, you lazy pig. The nearest in-line to inherit the patriarch title! You may don’t give a shit about your reputation now but if you are to take the leader's mantle from my father then all the crap they said would certainly bite your ass in the future! You hear?!”</p>\n<p>Shira picked his ear coolly. He might not know anything about the future, but certainly his cousin’s annoying nagging was biting his ass at this moment.</p>\n<p>“What are you doing alone in this kind of place anyway?”</p>\n<p>“You might not believe it, but I’m making a fortune here,” Shira said. Of course, whenever he played a game of chess with a spirit invisible to ordinary humans, he needed a quiet place where nobody was around. This was a perfect place for him.</p>\n<p>But Mila winced her eyes. A few seconds later, she turned her head, catching a canvas filled with rough sketches resting on the tree.</p>\n<p>“By painting?”</p>\n<p>“Sometimes that too.” Shira knew a bit about drawing scenery and people, so even with his limited interpersonal connection as an introvert he could make some money with his painting. However, his casual reply got Mila in a bad mood instead. Suddenly Shira remembered the embarrassing accident two months ago when Mila found an unfinished commision from a certain good-for-nothing spirit that he had carefully hidden in his house. When people commissioned a no-name painter they mostly asked for a portrait or image they deemed interesting. What kind of images Good-Natured Spirit found interesting? Women, of course. Especially those with big butts and big breasts. He liked them in thin, slipping clothings as if those vulnerable ladies were stuck in a very dangerous situation. In other words, erotic paintings.</p>\n<p>Then, sighing at the explosive nagging coming his way, Shira took a stick he slipped on his right ear and presented it as a bribe. Ancient southern Mossacks used berries and some used squid inks as pigments, but after waves of outside influence they started using quills and brushes, depending on the regions. Pencils, although practical, were introduced by a certain Nalaq spirit and Shira hadn’t heard anyone using it beside himself. The stick he used as a bribe was exactly a pencil. It sharpened many times and half-way on its way before he needed another one. Shira thought, maybe he should extort some more pencils for the next match from Good-Natured Spirit.</p>\n<p>Mila furrowed. She knew about the pencil and its value not too long ago thus, as expected, she grabbed it shamelessly. “What? Do you think you can escape only with this?”</p>\n<p>“I planned to give you something else but I think you’d rather like this simple bribe anyway.”</p>\n<p>Shira wanted to simply give her money to make her shut up. But the coins he had on him now only in form of foreign currency--the coins he extorted from Good-Natured Spirit from the last chess game. The boy frowned. Beside nagging him at full force, what did Mila coming here for?</p>\n<p>“Yeah, that reminds me, the news I wanted to tell you!” Mila finally snapped out of her nagging mode. “That Malikh girl! Your fiancée! After two years abroad! She’s finally coming home!”</p>\n<p>“Ohh…” the reply was anticlimactic.</p>\n<p>“Ohh? What the fuck with that reply?”</p>\n<p>“You don’t mind me. I just already burn out when people compare me with her,” Shira said. Although their age were the same, this young lady of Malikh Family was famous even in the nearby villages and town as a talent, with a promising look that might make her a beauty worth dying for. The old generations called her treasure and the boys loved her as the village princess. She went abroad two years ago for a series of seminars after an official from the capital scouted her talent. Now that she returned, everybody was fervently talking about her. But for Shira Yashura, the boy who was supposed to be the fiancé, even that kind of news wasn’t enough to make him get up from his comfortable napping.</p>\n<p>“My father wants to talk with you,” Mila said, “get up now.”</p>\n<p>“What about?”</p>\n<p>“You still asking?”</p>\n<p>The boy had a premonition that a troublesome matter would be waiting for him. Mila gave him an ultimatum before she wandered off to do her own things.</p>\n<p>“Hehe, what’s this fiancée I heard just now?” Good-Natured Spirit popped out his head from a tree beside Shira.</p>\n<p>“It’s not what you think,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“Oh yeah?” Good-Natured Spirit nudged the boy with his elbow. “I heard that chick is a hella beauty. Hehe, I bet her luggages is in good-quality, you know what I mean?”</p>\n<p>“From whom did you hear that?”</p>\n<p>“Doesn’t matter who. When it comes to chick my radar is very sensitive, eh. I’m curious. Did you benefit from this engagement thingy? Benefit, know what I mean?”</p>\n<p>Shira clicked his tongue. “Like I said, it’s not what you think it is. Our parents set us up and it’s been a mess since the talks about engagement got out.”</p>\n<p>Talking some sense to this good-for-nothing Nalaq was futile. Good-Natured Spirit kept teasing him. “You haven’t seen her for two years, have you? The talks I’ve been hearing down there real hairy, brat. I mean… especially those luggages of hers, know what I mean? Know what I mean? Nudge nudge. Nudge nudge,” he winked. “Wanna check on her?”</p>\n<p>“I need to go back. My uncle wants to talk with me.”</p>\n<p>“Alright then,” Good-Natured Spirit nodded as he rubbed his chin. “I’ll check the chick myself.”</p>\n<p>Carrying the canvas and the chess with him, Shira warned the Nalaq, “You better not do anything funny to her, hear me?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho. Jealous?”</p>\n<p>“I just don’t want their entire family coming right after me with pitchforks just because yo do something stupid.”</p>\n<p>After he said that Shira Yashura turned around. He started to walk down the hill. Good-Natured Spirit saw the boy walk without caring for the world, then he set off to check the girl by himself with a chuckle that escaped from his mouth.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A few hours later the said fiancée showed herself in a public training field. The field, owned by the most influential family in Badril Village--the Elzhier Family--was neatly arranged with archery targets and provided with dulled swords for the teenagers trained themselves or doing mock battles. The Elzhiers sent some menservants occasionally to act as security in case conflicts would occur. Today, the young master of the said family himself, nicknamed Bony, guarded the entrance along with two of his lackeys.</p>\n<p>“I’ve got to pay you to enter?!” a young man gawked at the sudden irregularity regarding the training field’s rules. “What’s this? The field is supposed to be free for everyone!”</p>\n<p>“Well, man, gotta pay for maintenance cost,” one of the lackeys, called Pilek, said as he rubbed his nose.</p>\n<p>“One silver kobe! Heh, maintenance cost my ass! Nobody would pay for this bullshit.”</p>\n<p>“Nobody? You wrong, man,” another lackey called Polio pointed at the crowd inside the training field with a gesture of his head. The girl from the Malikh Family causing a big ruckus from her arrival alone. She attracted boys like a bright lamp attracted fireflies. Because of that, the three deliquents in the entrance for nearly half an hour had been amassing quite a fortune till now.</p>\n<p>“I’ll definitely send complaints to Elzhier Family now. Just because your father is the village head you think you can do whatever you want, eh?” the young man snorted, sending a glare to them.</p>\n<p>The Elzhier Family’s young master, who had been watching with his back resting on the wall and his arms crossed, decided to open his mouth, he said, “Pay or get lost.”</p>\n<p>“Hear that? Boss Bony has spoken,” Pilek glared back at the young man with his head tilted. “Better get lost now or else…”</p>\n<p>“Or else!” Polio emphasized with a higher voice.</p>\n<p>The three of them had been infamous in the village despite being heirs to their respective families. Naturally, though they were the same age, only an idiot would butting head directly with the heir of Elzhier Family. Thus the young man snorted, unwillingly turned and walked away.</p>\n<p>“What the heck is that?” Pilek didn’t like the way that young man snorted at them. “We should teach bastards like him a few good lessons one of these days.”</p>\n<p>“You’re right,” Polio added.</p>\n<p>“Just ignore that bum,” Bony said.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, the next onlookers came. Not boys, but two girls to be exact. They carried bags of dirty clothes with them as they were on their way to wash the clothes at the river.</p>\n<p>“Well, I’d be damned,” one of the girls, a young lady named Romana, said, “I’ve been hearing about the rumors but looking at that Malikh girl, damn…. Look at how she did with her hair, Mila.”</p>\n<p>They could see what was happening in the field even from the entrance. The two girls looked at a certain girl who was surrounded by boys. The other girl, Mila Yashura, furrowed her brows at the current appearance of her cousin’s fiancée. She kept her mouth shut despite the anger on her eyes.</p>\n<p>“She cut her hair short despite being engaged to your cousin,” Romana said to Mila. “What’s that supposed to mean?”</p>\n<p>It was a custom of southern Mossack people for women to cut their hair short to tell the opposite sex they currently unavailable. Mostly widows who weren’t ready to be courted again chose to cut their hair that way. However, since the young lady of Malikh Family was currently engaged, the act of cutting her hair short was confusing to people.</p>\n<p>From the three delinquents who had been hearing their conversations, Pilek butted in, “Yo, ladies, don’t think too much about it. We southern people been foreigners with this fiancé-and-fiancée business. We practical people, y’know? Southerners the kind of people who would do it first then talking ‘bout marriage later. A chance she might not know what she was doing.”</p>\n<p>Romana rolled her eyes. Knowing Mila Yashura was here, she wished this stupid cheerful delinquent wouldn’t say what he had said. In fact, better for him to not open his mouth. She hated him whenever he opened his mouth and said pointless things.</p>\n<p>Her and Mila’s goal was to check about the rumor regarding the fiancée’s short hair. They didn’t have the intention to enter the training field and mingle with those crowdy horny boys, lest talking with these shameless thugs who clearly act as bandits.</p>\n<p>“Let’s go, Mila,” Romana whispered as she realized Mila had been glaring at the three delinquents. Moving her eyes from Mila, she looked at Bony who was in between his two lackeys. She whispered again, “you can’t fight him like you used to. He got a Knight class now. People said he can even fight another Knight with four level above him. Let’s just forget about it.”</p>\n<p>Last time Mila and Bony fought was three years ago. Her punch made his nose bleed but that was the end of it. It was a hot topic for a while and most didn’t know what happened but the long enmity between the two of them suddenly dropped cold and they had been avoiding each other. Seeing how the other party was quite well, Mila Yashura grimaced. They were Novices back then but now, after both of them ascended the first level barrier and got themselves class titles, there was no way a support-class Specialist like her could deliver that kind of punch again to his face.</p>\n<p>“Mm. Let’s go,” Mila said to Romana. No matter how brave and reckless she was, as a non-combatant talent, she knew better than to sow another discord with the village’s young generation’s strongest.</p>\n<p>Pilek, the most cheerful in Bony’s group, who was actually the most friendly, waved his hand to the girls as they walked away. Neither of them bothered with him.</p>\n<p>“Ahhh, my sister’s been avoiding me lately,” Pilek grumbled. Romana, Mila’s friend, was actually his half-sister from different mother. He was a proud big brother when they were young, until their mothers had a fight and his half-sister moved into a separate house.</p>\n<p>“Pilek,” Bony called.</p>\n<p>“Yes boss?”</p>\n<p>“You should’ve kept your mouth shut.”</p>\n<p>Pilek wryly smiled and nodded. Polio also thought his friend Pilek couldn’t read between the line. Although Pilek’s remark was well-intentioned, it’d just make things worse for Bony. The bad mood from back three years ago still left after taste that made him and her uncomfortable dealing with each other.</p>\n<p>After that, more people were coming to see the young lady of Malikh Family.</p>\n<p>The talks and speculations about her hair made the boys think she was dissatisfied with her engagement with Shira Yashura. Thus giving them hopes to snatch her away. It was no exaggeration to say that most of the boys fell for her, especially after they saw how the young lady grew beautifully. They surrounded this girl who had this icy expression on her face, though she herself greatly concentrated on holding a bow and an arrow, eyes straight to the archery target dozens of meters from her. She shot. And when the arrow hit splendidly, the boys would cheer and fawn all over her. The girl kept her face cold despite the flooding flattery coming at her way.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” a young man in his early twenty stepped forward from the bunch of admirers and confidently said, “I see you have this different aura about you. Something special that I can’t quite get my fingers on it, and I can’t help but feel curious about you.”</p>\n<p>That was supposed to be a pick-up line, but Bhela Malikh replied straightforwardly, “I changed. Now I’m Level 10 and not a Novice anymore.”</p>\n<p>“Oooohhhh!!” the crowd was surprised. Reaching the first barrier and got a class title at fifteen years old was the second time in these two decades. The first one was Bony. However, considering the girl was quite a talent enough for people in the capital to notice her, there was a high chance for her to snatch the crown as Badril Village’s young generation’s strongest from Bony sooner than everyone expected.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” the young man called for her attention again, despite his first attempt at hitting on her was an utter failure. “I see your beautiful sharp eyes and beautiful nimble hands and your beautiful pretty face. The class you’ve got must be… a beautiful <b>Archer</b>, right?”</p>\n<p>“I am an archer,” Bhela replied tight-lipped. Well, it was obvious when she picked a bow the first thing she arrived here.</p>\n<p>“Ah, a beautiful and talented Archer then! It’s a pity, though for such a fine beautiful flower like yourself to be thrown into a heap of cow dung…”</p>\n<p>The remark made Bhela Malikh raise her brows. She somehow could predict where the topic was going to be directed.</p>\n<p>“That stupid engagement is what I say! How could a diamond such as yourself be forced to marry a trash from Yashura Family?”</p>\n<p>He sighed like he pitied the harsh fate of the beauty. And though unlikeable as he was, the murmurs of the crowd seemingly agreed with him. At that point, someone said, “That’s true. Even my ten years old nephew is one Level above him. Such trash to become…”</p>\n<p>The words stopped, Bhela looked at the person who said that. “The one from Yashura Family--he’s still a Level 3 Novice?”</p>\n<p>It was someone else who replied to her question. “Ah, yes, he’s stuck and made no progress even since Young Lady Bhela went outside the village. Everyone calls him The Eternal Novice.”</p>\n<p>And this made her raised brows turned into a frown. Going by the crowd, for a Level 5 Novice by fifteen years old was already considered slow progress even by the standard of rural places like Badril Village. Mostly at that age the youngsters already reached Level 7, the diligent ones could reach Level 8 with hard work. Faster than that, not counting usage of an unreasonable amount of growth-hack potions--which most children from rich noble families did, could be considered a talent amongst the younger generation. However, to think of a boy one year before his own coming-of-age ceremony coming still stuck at such low-level talent, even though if he was the heir of Badril Village’s major families, people would still call him trash, even in public.</p>\n<p>“Ah, Young Lady Bhela! You don’t have to bother yourself with such eyesore trash. I know you’re troubled with the careless arrangement your father made, but if we put our mind to it, we can--”</p>\n<p>All was well until the young man put bad words about her father. Never did he expect that the girl would mercilessly retract her hand just before the tips of their fingers touched.</p>\n<p>“Please don’t pretend you were familiar with me,” that was what she said.</p>\n<p>The rain of snickers rang all around him. Despite him glaring left and right in an intimidating manner, there was no way for him to suppress the crowd from humiliating him further. At the time he realized the chance for him to court the Young Lady of Malikh Family, the sole daughter of the Malikh Family Patriarch, was pitifully close to nothing. Thus, in a moment of spontaneity, he thought of a scheme to save his face and sounded it with a flash of desperate smirk plastered on his face. He grabbed a bow and said, “I see Young Lady Bhela rather reserved toward us long friends after two years abroad. Hmm, yeah, this is a perfect chance, by the way. I’m an Archer too, see. So why not this senior teach you a thing or two? Seventy meters--perhaps a good learning experience for young lady, no?”</p>\n<p>The surrounding began chattering lively. It was obvious it was a challenge as Archers. And the young man’s smirk turned more and more confident at the girl’s unresponsiveness. No matter how much potential talent one had, time and experience playing a vital role in assessing one’s current performance whether she was Archer or Priest or Knight or other classes. Skills, abilities one acquired after reaching the first barrier and getting a new class title could only progress with constant tempering in battle and improved alongside one’s level. The young man was a Level 12 Archer. So theoretically, a Level 10 new Archer like Bhela Malikh would need a few more years before she could beat the opponent in a fair competition.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh was annoyed. She glared at the ones who were supposed to be guarding the field. But Bony and his lackeys were busy counting coins. For Bhela, the crowd were a bunch of stupid annoying busybodies who prevented her to train in peace. But for Bony and his lackeys the crowd was simply a bunch of gold mines.</p>\n<p>“Please watch closely how I do it, Young Lady Bhela. See my elbow? If you could do the same way I do it, I’m sure your archery skill would improve significantly.”</p>\n<p>No one really bothered with the ‘humble direction’ the young man spouted. Bhela didn’t spare him a glance. She looked straight to target seventy meters from where she was standing. Repressing his anger, the young man began to shoot three arrows one by one splendidly; the final one landed right in the center of the target that was marked in red dot.</p>\n<p>He was satisfied with the result. Glancing at the young lady, this young man wanted to utter more words to improve his image. However, right before he opened his mouth, he found Bhela already drew her arrow, released it, and it hit one arrow splendidly. Not just hitting the target, but an arrow the young man previously shot. The second was the same. And the final third arrow also hit the arrow on the red dot.</p>\n<p>What was that? She used a skill? The young man wanted to object but his tongue froze and his lips quivered. Did she use <b>Far Sight</b> skill that enhanced eye-sight a hundred of meters away? Did she use <b>Boost Accuracy</b>, the skill that was supposedly forbidden to be used in duel between Archers? To think of beating him, an Archer older than her and 2 Level right above her, in such a devastating manner… she must be cheating, right?</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” the defeated young man said weakly, “I didn’t use my mana between my shots.”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh nodded.</p>\n<p>“Neither was I.”</p>\n<p>With that, Bhela turned around and left the crowd of dumbfounded boys with steps full of grace. She approached the entrance, returned back the bow she used to the three delinquents who just let people mess with her training and said coldly, “If this is how the famous Young Master Elzhier manages his property, then there’s no need for me to come here again. Please excuse me.”</p>\n<p>Bony’s expression didn’t change much as he still crossed his arms and rested his back casually on the wall.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Pilek, the one received the returned bow from Bhela, waved his hand again and shouted, “Take care, princess!”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Because she couldn’t train her archery peacefully in public, Bhela returned back to Malikh Family and trained in her private training place.</p>\n<p>It was originally a backyard turned archery ground, made by Malikh Family Patriarch after knowing his daughter showed interest in archery. It was nothing fancy. It was spacious and good enough when she started with her first bow but now Bhela felt the place was lacking. At most, she had to live with the meager fifty meters range maximum. Therefore, the practice she had made a habit of had to wait.</p>\n<p>Therefore, Bhela Malikh decided to put her mind over something else than her usual practice instead.</p>\n<p>She drew a deep breath. A table was provided with dozens of arrows laid on top of it. Bhela picked four at the same time, nocked them on her bow string. She began to aim.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the air surrounding her changed. Her inexperience as a newly Novice-graduate showed by the obvious mana that leaked from the inside out. With naked eyes, her mana looked calm colorful haze that consisted of four bold colors, tangling and struggling with each other for dominance. Her eyelashes quivered. Channeling mana to cast a skill she yet had mastered felt like trying to stand on the raging sea waves while she herself was being a weak newborn.</p>\n<p><em>Whhhhuuuuushh--</em></p>\n<p><em>Shuuuhsh--</em></p>\n<p><em>Ssshhhuuuush--</em></p>\n<p><em>Wwhuuuussh!!</em></p>\n<p>The fastest arrow, coated with sparking yellow-colored mana, hit one of the targets at around forty meters range. But the others performed pitifully. The one infused with wet blue-colored mana didn’t even reach two-third of the desired range. The green-colored one, an arrow infused with mana that generated unstable wind trajectory flew far far away, as if it was getting swallowed by the sky, never to be seen again. The last one, the red-colored arrow, was horrifying. It hit the training ground fence instead the target. The bamboo fences suddenly set ablaze by raging flames as soon as the said arrow came into contact with them.</p>\n<p><em>Clap clap clap!</em></p>\n<p>Uninvited claps resounded across the training ground. On the wall Good-Natured Spirit clapping after watching a good spectacle. For getting hand claps from a Nalaq like him, naturally the level of talent Bhela showed just now was far beyond ordinary.</p>\n<p>“Thank you…” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>It appeared she knew beforehand the four-arrows skill she shot would make a mess. So she gathered the maidservants and made them extinguish the fences that started to burn into ashes. “Thank you, thank you for your hard work,” she said to a pair of maidservants who briskly went back and forth to kill the fire before its spread.</p>\n<p>“Ah! Young lady, what skill was that just now?” one of the maidservants gawked after the fire was extinguished.</p>\n<p>“That wasn’t just your ordinary Archer skill, was it?” added the other.</p>\n<p>Summoning a blazing fire just with an arrow and pure mana was unheard of. At least, the maidservants knew nobody in the village could do that.</p>\n<p>Bhela drank a glass of murky liquify herbs mixed with mint to cool down her manasphere. “It’s something I learned when I was away,” she said after putting down the glass on the tray her maid servants provided. She continued, “I still can’t master it, though.”</p>\n<p>She cast her eyes at the unharmed targets one by one. Shooting at forty meters range was still too much for her using four arrows at the same time. When the maidservants realized her difficulty, they encouraged her to simplify it and shoot one arrow at a time. However at their suggestion, Bhela shook her head. “It’s the requirement of this skill I’ve got to shoot four arrows,” she explained.</p>\n<p>The maidservants nodded at her words and apologized for their shallow suggestion.</p>\n<p>“Don’t mind that,” Bhela waved her hand. “There’s something I heard from people, by the way. Something about Young Master Yashura.”</p>\n<p>The two maidservants glanced at each other before one of them replied. “The rumor says… he holed up from the public’s view because he’s ashamed he can’t even become a Level 4 Novice.”</p>\n<p>“Are the Yashura Family elders still favoring him as the heir of Yashura Family Patriarch?”</p>\n<p>“We don’t know whether they still favor him or not. But Yashura Family always united in their standing. So unless the current Patriarch of Yashura Family has a son, the Young Master Shira Yashura will undoubtedly become the next patriarch.”</p>\n<p>“No rumors about the Yashura Family elders wavering then?”</p>\n<p>The maidservants shook their heads altogether.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela… apologize for giving you my shallow suggestion once again but…” one of the maidservants came near to Bhela and whispered, “With him as the heir, Yashura Family’s future will be bleak. Everyone in our family said your father’s bad condition is a bad omen for us mingling with those simple Yashuras. I’m very sorry if this sounds impudent--but you should’ve better cut ties with them before too late, young lady. Madam was too grieved by your father’s ill health to make decisions thus the only one who can save our Malikh Family is you.”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at the maidservant. The glint on her eyes changed.</p>\n<p>“There’s already a plan laid to help our Malikh Family,” that was all Bhela said. “You better not say something like that again. You lucky no one here beside me to hear you utter that kind of words.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you for your mercy, young lady! We are sorry for being impudent!”</p>\n<p>They decided to make it history with only the four of them who knew the previous conversation. The four of them; the young lady and two maid servants and one Nalaq spirit who came here uninvited.</p>\n<p>“It seems I just heard something I shouldn’t hear,” Good-Natured Spirit said while he rubbed his chin. He came here peeking. He didn’t have the intention to reveal himself while the girls below had a secret conversation ignorant of his presence.</p>\n<p>After that Bhela continued with light training. Good-Natured Spirit watched her doing simple shooting, she didn’t even use a slightest of her mana from then on. Yawning, Good-Natured Spirit stood up. Then he flew away from Malikh Family and began to look for some other interesting thing to sate his boredom.</p>\n<hr>\n<authors-note id=\"Radhy\">\n<p>Testing, testing.

Yesterday, he won a ghastly old encyclopedia nobody ever heard of. Today, the bet he eyed was silver coins. He didn’t know what he wanted from his opponent for tomorrow’s game. But the spirit in this dashing leather armor, adventurer-style, always wanted one thing for the game’s prize: taking control of the boy’s mortal body.</p>\n<p>More than a hundred games of chess later, the boy still got his healthy body intact, he never lost even once. And that made the spirit grow more dissatisfied as the days passing by.</p>\n<p>“Holy ff--! I clearly remember this damn bishop wasn’t there,” the spirit said. From the look of it, he was two moves away from getting his king owned.</p>\n<p>The boy clicked his tongue. He was hearing that kind of excuse every time the chess game came to its end.</p>\n<p>The spirit stubbornly closed the gap in his defense by sacrificing a rook. But soon, without taking a time to think, the boy casually moved his one horse, eating away the queen, sealing all the chance for the spirit to counter-attack.</p>\n<p>“Fuck this shit!!!”</p>\n<p>Enraged, the spirit flipped the chess board. About a dozen chess pieces hurled all side as they became the victims of the spirit’s frustration. The boy sighed. This was no good. Apparently he needed to be more considerate for the next game. He needed to pretend struggling before he crushed this impatient spirit so he didn’t feel cornered and ended up abandoning all these easy-money making games.</p>\n<p>“Hey,” the boy said. He tapped the flat-surfaced stone they used to lay the chess board before and reminded the spirit, almost as if he was saying “put the money here.”</p>\n<p>As annoyed as he was, the spirit could do nothing but give him a pouch of coins.</p>\n<p>“They are not kobes,” the boy said. “Shops and stalls in the village only accept kobe coins.”</p>\n<p>The spirit scoffed.</p>\n<p>“What do you know about it, brat. If you convert with the last week rate then you’ve got twice the shitty kobe you extort from me. Be glad about it.”</p>\n<p>“This won’t do, Ol’ Nalaq. The peddlers that come around here rarely accept strange currency. Neighbor country’s money is usually fine but I don’t think these coins would do. I don’t even know which country these coins are from.”</p>\n<p>“Then use it to add your savings,” the spirit said. “And don’t call me Nalaq. Don’t push your primitive tribal nonsense to me. Call me ‘Good-Natured Spirit’ as usual. I’m not like your usual Nalaqs, brat.”</p>\n<p>“It’s not tribal.” The boy didn’t show any sign of agreement. He didn’t know why this roguish-grinning spirit didn’t like to be called a Nalaq. The way southern Mossack people, like the boy himself, addressed spirits were usually by two terms: Nalaq and Selaq. As far as he knew Nalaq was a title worth to be proud of.</p>\n<novel-trivia label=”Lore”>\n<p>Nalaq were those of the spirit of fallen heroes and mages, had attained high-level of enlightenment to see ways to preserve souls across death. Whilst no longer to be alive, Nalaqs own their consciousness and retain their memories as well intelligence, though part of their original power diminished, especially those who relied on physical might during their prime.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Selaqs arose from death through unnatural causes, sometimes fueled by resentment and great energy of negativity. Though more powerful, their spirit didn’t dissipate because of strong, usually vile, emotions their harbour when they died, the restless spirits stuck in the limbo and returned back to the mortal world as hostile, mindless haunting spectres.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>Theoretically the spirit that currently playing chess was a Nalaq. He still got his consciousness, true. But, in a way, his intelligence seemed way apart from the Nalaqs southern Mossack tribes often revered in the past--that was what the boy had in mind when looking at this vulgar grinning spirit.</p>\n<p>“You’re not thinking something stupid about me, are you?” the spirit said with a snort as he realized the unexcited eyes the boy had as if he was looking at cow dung.</p>\n<p>“No, I was thinking just the usual--I was wondering about your very existence and your real identity.”</p>\n<p>“That so?” the spirit raised his chin. “Don’t need overthinking it, boy. Hehe. If you know even a piece of my name then you’d be amazed by how amazing I am. Everybody is my bitch when I’m still your age back then, hehe. That’s true.”</p>\n<p>“Hooohhh…” the boy half-heartedly nodded. As expected, every time he brought the topic about the spirit’s identity, all he got was empty talks, disgusting enough for him to regret for bringing up the topic. For now, the only joyous thing he got to do was counting the money he won from the chess game as the bullshit Good-Natured Spirit sang about his past tuning endlessly in the background.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Somewhere in Tiramikal Continent, far in the opposite side of the cold, barbaric northern lands, not too isolated from the bustling early-capitalistic empires of the western lands, and not too far away from the neighbor eastern lands of never-ending warfares between the eastern Kaya feudal lords, a village known as Badril Village was living peaceful for a number of years. The old blood the locals knew as Badril Village’s three big families rooted deeply these past one hundred years in spite of the thinning southern Mossack heritage. Despite slowly developing their rural village worthy of the westerner tourists and easterners refugees, the southern locals still taking pride in their Mossack hunters and gatherers ancestry. Exactly one year ago Good-Natured Spirit appeared in this humble village.󠆞</p>\n<p>On the wall of Yashura Family’s courtyard, which was ridiculously thick and tall for ordinary villages, the spirit took out a rolled paper of dried tobacco. This might not be common knowledge known only to limited people; for converting earthly materials to spiritual goods for Nalaqs to use, it could only be done in an expensive and complicated manner--usually performed in rituals by the royalties and great ancient clans for annual offerings to their ancestors. But the spirit in shabby leather armor did the converting for cigarettes and other trivial goods. Nobody knew how he did it. Even if they did, it’d be very hard to judge whether his quirk was worth to be admired or to be ridiculed at. Nevertheless he got this kind of air around him that telling people he didn’t care much about what they think.</p>\n<p>The street below the wall were children below ages of ten playing with sticks and chasing each other. When a crowd of housewives came, his eyes, sharp as an eagle’s, sweeping through in search of prey. One of his habit that obviously he brought with him since he was alive was to oogle women, especially for young wives and pretty middle-aged aunties interesting big breasts and interesting big butts. Despite his sighing and occasional annoying tongue-clicking, though, those wives and children didn’t turn their heads toward him. They didn’t even know a lecher ghost was there haunting the street. A Nalaq couldn’t be seen by common folks by default. Unless he wanted to, no one would realize there was a suspicious spirit ogling for women that were passing by.</p>\n<p>There was a young woman he knew trotted the street. Good-Natured Spirit knew her. She was neither a wife nor she was an aunty. Her butt and breasts sizes were also not worth being fusing about. The name was Mila Yashura, seventeen years old since last month. She was the older cousin of the boy he lost playing chess to.</p>\n<p>“Aunty,” Mila greeted an aunty by lowering her head, “did you see my cousin Shira around here?”</p>\n<p>The local wife she asked shook her head. Mila Yashura said a polite thanks and continued searching for her cousin.</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit swept the street with his eyes, looking for something. When he saw a certain manservant he stopped. Using his spiritual knife, he dismantled a small pebble from the stone wall he sat on, flicked it using his thumb and knocked the manservant’s head with it.</p>\n<p>“Ouch!” the manservant cried.</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura abruptly turned her head and saw a manservant of her Yashura Family holding his head. She briskly coming to him and asked the same question she threw to the aunty before.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira?” the manservant glanced at the direction of the hill behind Yashura Family’s wall. “I saw him walking there at noon. But whether he has returned or not I don’t know.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you. That’s good enough. Here, treat yourself some coffee beans before the peddlers set for the next village.”</p>\n<p>The hill behind the Yashura Family’s dwelling was originally a place where the family members brought the family’s goats to graze its green grasses. But under the current patriarch’s management, the family’s fortunate mostly put on investing on coconut plantations, thus some grazing places were left unused.</p>\n<p>“Shira! So here’s you holing yourself. I’ve been searching you for nearly an hour,” Mila saw how her cousin who was two years younger than her enjoying himself lying under a shadowy tree, using his arms as pillows. She kicked his foot, yelling him to get up, but Shira merely changed his position and groaned in protest.</p>\n<p>“This buffon…” Mila hissed. “You know how the fact you’re lazing around everyday breeds all those crappy rumors, don’t you?”</p>\n<p>“People can talk whatever they want as long as they don’t bother me,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“But they bother our family!”</p>\n<p>Mila inhaling a deep breath. Now her voice getting higher annoyingly and she continued, “You’re the young master of our family, you lazy pig. The nearest in-line to inherit the patriarch title! You may don’t give a shit about your reputation now but if you are to take the leader's mantle from my father then all the crap they said would certainly bite your ass in the future! You hear?!”</p>\n<p>Shira picked his ear coolly. He might not know anything about the future, but certainly his cousin’s annoying nagging was biting his ass at this moment.</p>\n<p>“What are you doing alone in this kind of place anyway?”</p>\n<p>“You might not believe it, but I’m making a fortune here,” Shira said. Of course, whenever he played a game of chess with a spirit invisible to ordinary humans, he needed a quiet place where nobody was around. This was a perfect place for him.</p>\n<p>But Mila winced her eyes. A few seconds later, she turned her head, catching a canvas filled with rough sketches resting on the tree.</p>\n<p>“By painting?”</p>\n<p>“Sometimes that too.” Shira knew a bit about drawing scenery and people, so even with his limited interpersonal connection as an introvert he could make some money with his painting. However, his casual reply got Mila in a bad mood instead. Suddenly Shira remembered the embarrassing accident two months ago when Mila found an unfinished commision from a certain good-for-nothing spirit that he had carefully hidden in his house. When people commissioned a no-name painter they mostly asked for a portrait or image they deemed interesting. What kind of images Good-Natured Spirit found interesting? Women, of course. Especially those with big butts and big breasts. He liked them in thin, slipping clothings as if those vulnerable ladies were stuck in a very dangerous situation. In other words, erotic paintings.</p>\n<p>Then, sighing at the explosive nagging coming his way, Shira took a stick he slipped on his right ear and presented it as a bribe. Ancient southern Mossacks used berries and some used squid inks as pigments, but after waves of outside influence they started using quills and brushes, depending on the regions. Pencils, although practical, were introduced by a certain Nalaq spirit and Shira hadn’t heard anyone using it beside himself. The stick he used as a bribe was exactly a pencil. It sharpened many times and half-way on its way before he needed another one. Shira thought, maybe he should extort some more pencils for the next match from Good-Natured Spirit.</p>\n<p>Mila furrowed. She knew about the pencil and its value not too long ago thus, as expected, she grabbed it shamelessly. “What? Do you think you can escape only with this?”</p>\n<p>“I planned to give you something else but I think you’d rather like this simple bribe anyway.”</p>\n<p>Shira wanted to simply give her money to make her shut up. But the coins he had on him now only in form of foreign currency--the coins he extorted from Good-Natured Spirit from the last chess game. The boy frowned. Beside nagging him at full force, what did Mila coming here for?</p>\n<p>“Yeah, that reminds me, the news I wanted to tell you!” Mila finally snapped out of her nagging mode. “That Malikh girl! Your fiancée! After two years abroad! She’s finally coming home!”</p>\n<p>“Ohh…” the reply was anticlimactic.</p>\n<p>“Ohh? What the fuck with that reply?”</p>\n<p>“You don’t mind me. I just already burn out when people compare me with her,” Shira said. Although their age were the same, this young lady of Malikh Family was famous even in the nearby villages and town as a talent, with a promising look that might make her a beauty worth dying for. The old generations called her treasure and the boys loved her as the village princess. She went abroad two years ago for a series of seminars after an official from the capital scouted her talent. Now that she returned, everybody was fervently talking about her. But for Shira Yashura, the boy who was supposed to be the fiancé, even that kind of news wasn’t enough to make him get up from his comfortable napping.</p>\n<p>“My father wants to talk with you,” Mila said, “get up now.”</p>\n<p>“What about?”</p>\n<p>“You still asking?”</p>\n<p>The boy had a premonition that a troublesome matter would be waiting for him. Mila gave him an ultimatum before she wandered off to do her own things.</p>\n<p>“Hehe, what’s this fiancée I heard just now?” Good-Natured Spirit popped out his head from a tree beside Shira.</p>\n<p>“It’s not what you think,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“Oh yeah?” Good-Natured Spirit nudged the boy with his elbow. “I heard that chick is a hella beauty. Hehe, I bet her luggages is in good-quality, you know what I mean?”</p>\n<p>“From whom did you hear that?”</p>\n<p>“Doesn’t matter who. When it comes to chick my radar is very sensitive, eh. I’m curious. Did you benefit from this engagement thingy? Benefit, know what I mean?”</p>\n<p>Shira clicked his tongue. “Like I said, it’s not what you think it is. Our parents set us up and it’s been a mess since the talks about engagement got out.”</p>\n<p>Talking some sense to this good-for-nothing Nalaq was futile. Good-Natured Spirit kept teasing him. “You haven’t seen her for two years, have you? The talks I’ve been hearing down there real hairy, brat. I mean… especially those luggages of hers, know what I mean? Know what I mean? Nudge nudge. Nudge nudge,” he winked. “Wanna check on her?”</p>\n<p>“I need to go back. My uncle wants to talk with me.”</p>\n<p>“Alright then,” Good-Natured Spirit nodded as he rubbed his chin. “I’ll check the chick myself.”</p>\n<p>Carrying the canvas and the chess with him, Shira warned the Nalaq, “You better not do anything funny to her, hear me?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho. Jealous?”</p>\n<p>“I just don’t want their entire family coming right after me with pitchforks just because yo do something stupid.”</p>\n<p>After he said that Shira Yashura turned around. He started to walk down the hill. Good-Natured Spirit saw the boy walk without caring for the world, then he set off to check the girl by himself with a chuckle that escaped from his mouth.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A few hours later the said fiancée showed herself in a public training field. The field, owned by the most influential family in Badril Village--the Elzhier Family--was neatly arranged with archery targets and provided with dulled swords for the teenagers trained themselves or doing mock battles. The Elzhiers sent some menservants occasionally to act as security in case conflicts would occur. Today, the young master of the said family himself, nicknamed Bony, guarded the entrance along with two of his lackeys.</p>\n<p>“I’ve got to pay you to enter?!” a young man gawked at the sudden irregularity regarding the training field’s rules. “What’s this? The field is supposed to be free for everyone!”</p>\n<p>“Well, man, gotta pay for maintenance cost,” one of the lackeys, called Pilek, said as he rubbed his nose.</p>\n<p>“One silver kobe! Heh, maintenance cost my ass! Nobody would pay for this bullshit.”</p>\n<p>“Nobody? You wrong, man,” another lackey called Polio pointed at the crowd inside the training field with a gesture of his head. The girl from the Malikh Family causing a big ruckus from her arrival alone. She attracted boys like a bright lamp attracted fireflies. Because of that, the three deliquents in the entrance for nearly half an hour had been amassing quite a fortune till now.</p>\n<p>“I’ll definitely send complaints to Elzhier Family now. Just because your father is the village head you think you can do whatever you want, eh?” the young man snorted, sending a glare to them.</p>\n<p>The Elzhier Family’s young master, who had been watching with his back resting on the wall and his arms crossed, decided to open his mouth, he said, “Pay or get lost.”</p>\n<p>“Hear that? Boss Bony has spoken,” Pilek glared back at the young man with his head tilted. “Better get lost now or else…”</p>\n<p>“Or else!” Polio emphasized with a higher voice.</p>\n<p>The three of them had been infamous in the village despite being heirs to their respective families. Naturally, though they were the same age, only an idiot would butting head directly with the heir of Elzhier Family. Thus the young man snorted, unwillingly turned and walked away.</p>\n<p>“What the heck is that?” Pilek didn’t like the way that young man snorted at them. “We should teach bastards like him a few good lessons one of these days.”</p>\n<p>“You’re right,” Polio added.</p>\n<p>“Just ignore that bum,” Bony said.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, the next onlookers came. Not boys, but two girls to be exact. They carried bags of dirty clothes with them as they were on their way to wash the clothes at the river.</p>\n<p>“Well, I’d be damned,” one of the girls, a young lady named Romana, said, “I’ve been hearing about the rumors but looking at that Malikh girl, damn…. Look at how she did with her hair, Mila.”</p>\n<p>They could see what was happening in the field even from the entrance. The two girls looked at a certain girl who was surrounded by boys. The other girl, Mila Yashura, furrowed her brows at the current appearance of her cousin’s fiancée. She kept her mouth shut despite the anger on her eyes.</p>\n<p>“She cut her hair short despite being engaged to your cousin,” Romana said to Mila. “What’s that supposed to mean?”</p>\n<p>It was a custom of southern Mossack people for women to cut their hair short to tell the opposite sex they currently unavailable. Mostly widows who weren’t ready to be courted again chose to cut their hair that way. However, since the young lady of Malikh Family was currently engaged, the act of cutting her hair short was confusing to people.</p>\n<p>From the three delinquents who had been hearing their conversations, Pilek butted in, “Yo, ladies, don’t think too much about it. We southern people been foreigners with this fiancé-and-fiancée business. We practical people, y’know? Southerners the kind of people who would do it first then talking ‘bout marriage later. A chance she might not know what she was doing.”</p>\n<p>Romana rolled her eyes. Knowing Mila Yashura was here, she wished this stupid cheerful delinquent wouldn’t say what he had said. In fact, better for him to not open his mouth. She hated him whenever he opened his mouth and said pointless things.</p>\n<p>Her and Mila’s goal was to check about the rumor regarding the fiancée’s short hair. They didn’t have the intention to enter the training field and mingle with those crowdy horny boys, lest talking with these shameless thugs who clearly act as bandits.</p>\n<p>“Let’s go, Mila,” Romana whispered as she realized Mila had been glaring at the three delinquents. Moving her eyes from Mila, she looked at Bony who was in between his two lackeys. She whispered again, “you can’t fight him like you used to. He got a Knight class now. People said he can even fight another Knight with four level above him. Let’s just forget about it.”</p>\n<p>Last time Mila and Bony fought was three years ago. Her punch made his nose bleed but that was the end of it. It was a hot topic for a while and most didn’t know what happened but the long enmity between the two of them suddenly dropped cold and they had been avoiding each other. Seeing how the other party was quite well, Mila Yashura grimaced. They were Novices back then but now, after both of them ascended the first level barrier and got themselves class titles, there was no way a support-class Specialist like her could deliver that kind of punch again to his face.</p>\n<p>“Mm. Let’s go,” Mila said to Romana. No matter how brave and reckless she was, as a non-combatant talent, she knew better than to sow another discord with the village’s young generation’s strongest.</p>\n<p>Pilek, the most cheerful in Bony’s group, who was actually the most friendly, waved his hand to the girls as they walked away. Neither of them bothered with him.</p>\n<p>“Ahhh, my sister’s been avoiding me lately,” Pilek grumbled. Romana, Mila’s friend, was actually his half-sister from different mother. He was a proud big brother when they were young, until their mothers had a fight and his half-sister moved into a separate house.</p>\n<p>“Pilek,” Bony called.</p>\n<p>“Yes boss?”</p>\n<p>“You should’ve kept your mouth shut.”</p>\n<p>Pilek wryly smiled and nodded. Polio also thought his friend Pilek couldn’t read between the line. Although Pilek’s remark was well-intentioned, it’d just make things worse for Bony. The bad mood from back three years ago still left after taste that made him and her uncomfortable dealing with each other.</p>\n<p>After that, more people were coming to see the young lady of Malikh Family.</p>\n<p>The talks and speculations about her hair made the boys think she was dissatisfied with her engagement with Shira Yashura. Thus giving them hopes to snatch her away. It was no exaggeration to say that most of the boys fell for her, especially after they saw how the young lady grew beautifully. They surrounded this girl who had this icy expression on her face, though she herself greatly concentrated on holding a bow and an arrow, eyes straight to the archery target dozens of meters from her. She shot. And when the arrow hit splendidly, the boys would cheer and fawn all over her. The girl kept her face cold despite the flooding flattery coming at her way.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” a young man in his early twenty stepped forward from the bunch of admirers and confidently said, “I see you have this different aura about you. Something special that I can’t quite get my fingers on it, and I can’t help but feel curious about you.”</p>\n<p>That was supposed to be a pick-up line, but Bhela Malikh replied straightforwardly, “I changed. Now I’m Level 10 and not a Novice anymore.”</p>\n<p>“Oooohhhh!!” the crowd was surprised. Reaching the first barrier and got a class title at fifteen years old was the second time in these two decades. The first one was Bony. However, considering the girl was quite a talent enough for people in the capital to notice her, there was a high chance for her to snatch the crown as Badril Village’s young generation’s strongest from Bony sooner than everyone expected.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” the young man called for her attention again, despite his first attempt at hitting on her was an utter failure. “I see your beautiful sharp eyes and beautiful nimble hands and your beautiful pretty face. The class you’ve got must be… a beautiful <b>Archer</b>, right?”</p>\n<p>“I am an archer,” Bhela replied tight-lipped. Well, it was obvious when she picked a bow the first thing she arrived here.</p>\n<p>“Ah, a beautiful and talented Archer then! It’s a pity, though for such a fine beautiful flower like yourself to be thrown into a heap of cow dung…”</p>\n<p>The remark made Bhela Malikh raise her brows. She somehow could predict where the topic was going to be directed.</p>\n<p>“That stupid engagement is what I say! How could a diamond such as yourself be forced to marry a trash from Yashura Family?”</p>\n<p>He sighed like he pitied the harsh fate of the beauty. And though unlikeable as he was, the murmurs of the crowd seemingly agreed with him. At that point, someone said, “That’s true. Even my ten years old nephew is one Level above him. Such trash to become…”</p>\n<p>The words stopped, Bhela looked at the person who said that. “The one from Yashura Family--he’s still a Level 3 Novice?”</p>\n<p>It was someone else who replied to her question. “Ah, yes, he’s stuck and made no progress even since Young Lady Bhela went outside the village. Everyone calls him The Eternal Novice.”</p>\n<p>And this made her raised brows turned into a frown. Going by the crowd, for a Level 5 Novice by fifteen years old was already considered slow progress even by the standard of rural places like Badril Village. Mostly at that age the youngsters already reached Level 7, the diligent ones could reach Level 8 with hard work. Faster than that, not counting usage of an unreasonable amount of growth-hack potions--which most children from rich noble families did, could be considered a talent amongst the younger generation. However, to think of a boy one year before his own coming-of-age ceremony coming still stuck at such low-level talent, even though if he was the heir of Badril Village’s major families, people would still call him trash, even in public.</p>\n<p>“Ah, Young Lady Bhela! You don’t have to bother yourself with such eyesore trash. I know you’re troubled with the careless arrangement your father made, but if we put our mind to it, we can--”</p>\n<p>All was well until the young man put bad words about her father. Never did he expect that the girl would mercilessly retract her hand just before the tips of their fingers touched.</p>\n<p>“Please don’t pretend you were familiar with me,” that was what she said.</p>\n<p>The rain of snickers rang all around him. Despite him glaring left and right in an intimidating manner, there was no way for him to suppress the crowd from humiliating him further. At the time he realized the chance for him to court the Young Lady of Malikh Family, the sole daughter of the Malikh Family Patriarch, was pitifully close to nothing. Thus, in a moment of spontaneity, he thought of a scheme to save his face and sounded it with a flash of desperate smirk plastered on his face. He grabbed a bow and said, “I see Young Lady Bhela rather reserved toward us long friends after two years abroad. Hmm, yeah, this is a perfect chance, by the way. I’m an Archer too, see. So why not this senior teach you a thing or two? Seventy meters--perhaps a good learning experience for young lady, no?”</p>\n<p>The surrounding began chattering lively. It was obvious it was a challenge as Archers. And the young man’s smirk turned more and more confident at the girl’s unresponsiveness. No matter how much potential talent one had, time and experience playing a vital role in assessing one’s current performance whether she was Archer or Priest or Knight or other classes. Skills, abilities one acquired after reaching the first barrier and getting a new class title could only progress with constant tempering in battle and improved alongside one’s level. The young man was a Level 12 Archer. So theoretically, a Level 10 new Archer like Bhela Malikh would need a few more years before she could beat the opponent in a fair competition.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh was annoyed. She glared at the ones who were supposed to be guarding the field. But Bony and his lackeys were busy counting coins. For Bhela, the crowd were a bunch of stupid annoying busybodies who prevented her to train in peace. But for Bony and his lackeys the crowd was simply a bunch of gold mines.</p>\n<p>“Please watch closely how I do it, Young Lady Bhela. See my elbow? If you could do the same way I do it, I’m sure your archery skill would improve significantly.”</p>\n<p>No one really bothered with the ‘humble direction’ the young man spouted. Bhela didn’t spare him a glance. She looked straight to target seventy meters from where she was standing. Repressing his anger, the young man began to shoot three arrows one by one splendidly; the final one landed right in the center of the target that was marked in red dot.</p>\n<p>He was satisfied with the result. Glancing at the young lady, this young man wanted to utter more words to improve his image. However, right before he opened his mouth, he found Bhela already drew her arrow, released it, and it hit one arrow splendidly. Not just hitting the target, but an arrow the young man previously shot. The second was the same. And the final third arrow also hit the arrow on the red dot.</p>\n<p>What was that? She used a skill? The young man wanted to object but his tongue froze and his lips quivered. Did she use <b>Far Sight</b> skill that enhanced eye-sight a hundred of meters away? Did she use <b>Boost Accuracy</b>, the skill that was supposedly forbidden to be used in duel between Archers? To think of beating him, an Archer older than her and 2 Level right above her, in such a devastating manner… she must be cheating, right?</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” the defeated young man said weakly, “I didn’t use my mana between my shots.”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh nodded.</p>\n<p>“Neither was I.”</p>\n<p>With that, Bhela turned around and left the crowd of dumbfounded boys with steps full of grace. She approached the entrance, returned back the bow she used to the three delinquents who just let people mess with her training and said coldly, “If this is how the famous Young Master Elzhier manages his property, then there’s no need for me to come here again. Please excuse me.”</p>\n<p>Bony’s expression didn’t change much as he still crossed his arms and rested his back casually on the wall.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Pilek, the one received the returned bow from Bhela, waved his hand again and shouted, “Take care, princess!”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Because she couldn’t train her archery peacefully in public, Bhela returned back to Malikh Family and trained in her private training place.</p>\n<p>It was originally a backyard turned archery ground, made by Malikh Family Patriarch after knowing his daughter showed interest in archery. It was nothing fancy. It was spacious and good enough when she started with her first bow but now Bhela felt the place was lacking. At most, she had to live with the meager fifty meters range maximum. Therefore, the practice she had made a habit of had to wait.</p>\n<p>Therefore, Bhela Malikh decided to put her mind over something else than her usual practice instead.</p>\n<p>She drew a deep breath. A table was provided with dozens of arrows laid on top of it. Bhela picked four at the same time, nocked them on her bow string. She began to aim.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the air surrounding her changed. Her inexperience as a newly Novice-graduate showed by the obvious mana that leaked from the inside out. With naked eyes, her mana looked calm colorful haze that consisted of four bold colors, tangling and struggling with each other for dominance. Her eyelashes quivered. Channeling mana to cast a skill she yet had mastered felt like trying to stand on the raging sea waves while she herself was being a weak newborn.</p>\n<p><em>Whhhhuuuuushh--</em></p>\n<p><em>Shuuuhsh--</em></p>\n<p><em>Ssshhhuuuush--</em></p>\n<p><em>Wwhuuuussh!!</em></p>\n<p>The fastest arrow, coated with sparking yellow-colored mana, hit one of the targets at around forty meters range. But the others performed pitifully. The one infused with wet blue-colored mana didn’t even reach two-third of the desired range. The green-colored one, an arrow infused with mana that generated unstable wind trajectory flew far far away, as if it was getting swallowed by the sky, never to be seen again. The last one, the red-colored arrow, was horrifying. It hit the training ground fence instead the target. The bamboo fences suddenly set ablaze by raging flames as soon as the said arrow came into contact with them.</p>\n<p><em>Clap clap clap!</em></p>\n<p>Uninvited claps resounded across the training ground. On the wall Good-Natured Spirit clapping after watching a good spectacle. For getting hand claps from a Nalaq like him, naturally the level of talent Bhela showed just now was far beyond ordinary.</p>\n<p>“Thank you…” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>It appeared she knew beforehand the four-arrows skill she shot would make a mess. So she gathered the maidservants and made them extinguish the fences that started to burn into ashes. “Thank you, thank you for your hard work,” she said to a pair of maidservants who briskly went back and forth to kill the fire before its spread.</p>\n<p>“Ah! Young lady, what skill was that just now?” one of the maidservants gawked after the fire was extinguished.</p>\n<p>“That wasn’t just your ordinary Archer skill, was it?” added the other.</p>\n<p>Summoning a blazing fire just with an arrow and pure mana was unheard of. At least, the maidservants knew nobody in the village could do that.</p>\n<p>Bhela drank a glass of murky liquify herbs mixed with mint to cool down her manasphere. “It’s something I learned when I was away,” she said after putting down the glass on the tray her maid servants provided. She continued, “I still can’t master it, though.”</p>\n<p>She cast her eyes at the unharmed targets one by one. Shooting at forty meters range was still too much for her using four arrows at the same time. When the maidservants realized her difficulty, they encouraged her to simplify it and shoot one arrow at a time. However at their suggestion, Bhela shook her head. “It’s the requirement of this skill I’ve got to shoot four arrows,” she explained.</p>\n<p>The maidservants nodded at her words and apologized for their shallow suggestion.</p>\n<p>“Don’t mind that,” Bhela waved her hand. “There’s something I heard from people, by the way. Something about Young Master Yashura.”</p>\n<p>The two maidservants glanced at each other before one of them replied. “The rumor says… he holed up from the public’s view because he’s ashamed he can’t even become a Level 4 Novice.”</p>\n<p>“Are the Yashura Family elders still favoring him as the heir of Yashura Family Patriarch?”</p>\n<p>“We don’t know whether they still favor him or not. But Yashura Family always united in their standing. So unless the current Patriarch of Yashura Family has a son, the Young Master Shira Yashura will undoubtedly become the next patriarch.”</p>\n<p>“No rumors about the Yashura Family elders wavering then?”</p>\n<p>The maidservants shook their heads altogether.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela… apologize for giving you my shallow suggestion once again but…” one of the maidservants came near to Bhela and whispered, “With him as the heir, Yashura Family’s future will be bleak. Everyone in our family said your father’s bad condition is a bad omen for us mingling with those simple Yashuras. I’m very sorry if this sounds impudent--but you should’ve better cut ties with them before too late, young lady. Madam was too grieved by your father’s ill health to make decisions thus the only one who can save our Malikh Family is you.”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at the maidservant. The glint on her eyes changed.</p>\n<p>“There’s already a plan laid to help our Malikh Family,” that was all Bhela said. “You better not say something like that again. You lucky no one here beside me to hear you utter that kind of words.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you for your mercy, young lady! We are sorry for being impudent!”</p>\n<p>They decided to make it history with only the four of them who knew the previous conversation. The four of them; the young lady and two maid servants and one Nalaq spirit who came here uninvited.</p>\n<p>“It seems I just heard something I shouldn’t hear,” Good-Natured Spirit said while he rubbed his chin. He came here peeking. He didn’t have the intention to reveal himself while the girls below had a secret conversation ignorant of his presence.</p>\n<p>After that Bhela continued with light training. Good-Natured Spirit watched her doing simple shooting, she didn’t even use a slightest of her mana from then on. Yawning, Good-Natured Spirit stood up. Then he flew away from Malikh Family and began to look for some other interesting thing to sate his boredom.</p>\n<hr>\n<authors-note id=\"Radhy\">\n<p>Testing, testing.

Please, anything but there!” she promptly cling on the head maid’s legs. “Don’t send me to Young Lady’s place, please so something for me to get my old post back, we’re sisters for years, head maid! Please, do me a favor--just this once!”</p>\n<p>“Jane, don’t be foolish, the new girl is Butler Tim’s niece. They’ve been waiting for a post to be empty to slip her in the past two months. Do you think I could get it back that easily?”</p>\n<p>“H-head maid…” Jane knew, although Butler Tim didn’t have enough influence to be a tyrant in Blackwood Family’s manor, still not someone Jane could afford to offend. Biting her bottom lip, she whispered, “Please, head maid… if I perished due to bad luck, how could my family pay their debts?”</p>\n<p>“Get up now. Didn’t you say you have a way to pay it without working here for a dozen years more?”</p>\n<p>“That was before,” Jane’s voice was hoarse, “I never would’ve thought that bastard only spout empty promises of taking care of my family and other bullshit.

Everybody’s ended up dead after they were sent to Young Lady’s place!”</p>\n<p>“Nonsense.

She immediately came to head maid as soon as she knew her old post being taken and didn’t have time to gossip with other maidservants. “Really, head maid, you know I just came back. Don’t talk in a roundabout way…”</p>\n<p>“Sir Arden is going to hire an expert to clear plague in our Young Lady’s mansion, he’s planning to do it in a month's time,” the head maid said. “You know Sir Arden’s reputation, and you know how reliable his words are. Go serve Young Lady there--by the time Sir Arden comes with the hired expert, he’ll be grateful for loyal servants who willing to accompany his niece in her difficult time!”</p>\n<p>Hearing the urge behind head maid’s tone, Jane choked by her own cry from earlier. Even Madam Blackwood had to be polite to this younger brother of hers--as the man’s reputation was the sole reason Madam could be so tyrannical on ruling the house. But even then Sir Arden was too lazy to pay attention to his sister and her be. Jane, a mere maidservant--could she really gain Sir Arden Blackwood’s favor?</p>\n<p>The head maid continued, “What are you hesitating for? Even Floria that girl who even prettier than you couldn’t even get Sir Arden to glance at her--do you think any girl can have the same chance as yours right now?” she paused, learning the contour of Jane’s expression before she said again, “even if you can’t be his mistress, Jane, I assure you that even Butler Tim won’t be able to touch your position if Sir Arden Blackwood has a good impression on you.”</p>\n<p>Jane lowered her head.

This steward talked as if he was sincerely giving advice, yet for those in the main manor who didn’t know the rumors about their young lady?

A moment later, Jane was stupefied when she found out that the two white doll-like girls with black eyebags on them were actually Emeralda and Jenny she had known back since her first year being a maidservant. No longer Jane could see two noise sisters of hers who always skipped work to gossip, only two sets of dead eyes left, seeing her but not with greeting eyes, almost like strangers.</p>\n<p>“Welcome,” Emeralda greeted with a flat tone.</p>\n<p>“Welcome,” the other girl repeated.

Even though the expensive Ngajen Ceremony drew near a good number of ducks and a goat were butchered along with their spice reserves taken out. There were laughters, there lots of people wanted to get on the good side of the only Young Lady of Malikh Family.</p>\n<p>But Bhela’s face was straight the whole time. Given choices, she’d rather have a small dinner with her mother and sick father right now.</p>\n<p>“I heard you went to Elzhier’s training facility as soon as you arrived, young lady,” a bald elder said with big smile. “That is no good. You just return home after four days of traveling. You must have a good rest first.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you for your concern, Elder Jhamil.”</p>\n<p>Bhela had experience with people during her two years abroad to know the meaning of smiles like Elder Jhamil’s--the kind of smile that didn’t reach eyes, the fake kind of smile. She always found it was uncomfortable whenever she met with one. Yet what was more uncomfortable was the fact she was the star of the party. Flatteries and congratulations flowing in. Bhela kept nodding her head and had a smiling expression on her face. No one really had a good time beside the ignorant families who came to find abundant foods to eat.</p>\n<p>Finally toward the end of the big dinner Elder Jhamil gave a few speeches and led everyone for their patriarch's health. Bhela hadn’t come home for two years, but she was alert enough to know the popular opinion going around inside the Malikh Family. She knew her father was disliked by many because the engagement he set up more than a dozen years ago, back when she wasn’t even able to speak yet, back when the Malikhs didn’t think much of it and didn’t know the girl back then would grow splendidly into a fair Young Lady. What she didn’t expect was that, Elder Jhamil, would point it out in front of other family members.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady, I’m sure you’re aware about it by now, but the one from Yashura Family is still stuck on the same level from back when you were leaving for your seminars.”</p>\n<p>“I’m aware, yes,” she said. “And?”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil smiled dryly at the question, he said, “With a partner that lazy he’d drag you sooner or later, wouldn’t he? Especially with special talent as yours, many would have second thoughts. But then how about you? Are you fine with that, Young Lady?”</p>\n<p>Bhela didn’t immediately say what was on her mind. She quietly picked the warm ginger drink they served her, drank it, while her eyes glanced at a certain direction where two maidservants who immediately glanced down the moment her eyes came into contact with theirs.</p>\n<p>Seeing that Bhela wasn’t that responsive with the idea, Elder Jhamil spoke further, “Young Lady, don’t worry, we as Malikhs only worried about your future. If you feel injustice in your heart, you must be brave, you must voice it out to your parents, Young Lady Bhela--all of us Malikhs support you for whichever path you choose! Isn’t that right, everyone?”</p>\n<p>“That’s right!” someone shouted. Then came more rougher voice--</p>\n<p>“We don’t fear those Yashura’s retaliation, Young Lady. You don’t have to be afraid they’ll come here to bully us because of that trash from Yashura Family!”</p>\n<p>“We support you, Young Lady!”</p>\n<p>“Don’t be afraid!”</p>\n<p>The dry smile on Elder Jhamil turned elated when people were chanting along with his cue. It was only when Bhela slowly put down the warm glass of ginger drink in her hand did they stop making ruckus, everyone was waiting for what Bhela was going to say next.</p>\n<p>“I think,” Bhela said with the remarkable cold expression of hers, “any engagement in the main family should be the main family’s business only.”</p>\n<p>She stopped. Not a single more soul dared to send her further flatteries until dinner was over. Even the bald Elder Jhamil, the most enthusiastic of all them, quietly sat back where he belonged.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>“Ah, young lady, please wait, Young Lady Bhela!” the bald Elder Jhamil chased her, trotting, with a box in his hands.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh frowned upon hearing the voice. But she hid her expression well as turned around and asked, “Is something the matter, Elder Jhamil?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, in fact, there’s one matter a bit inappropriate to deal in the family hall,” as soon as Elder Jhamil said that, he opened the box he carried. It was a dress. “It’s something that I get from a merchant who has a lot of dealing with people in the west. He told me this is apparently the current popular fashion for western nobles. I think it’s good for Young Lady.”</p>\n<p>Bhela studied Elder Jhamil’s expression. If the dress truly was a fashionable goods then the elder ought to have paid a quite of coins to get this. As far as Bhela Malikh remembered, Elder Jhamil she knew wasn’t this kind even when her father the patriarch married. Naturally with such an expensive homecoming gift, Bhela was alerted.</p>\n<p>“Thank you for your kindness, Elder Jhamil. Bhela will treasure this well.”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, you don’t have to mention it, Young Lady Bhela,” Elder Jhamil said with a laugh. Then, while rubbing his palms unconsciously, the bald elder began to smile--not a fake one like he usually did have, a genuine smile, one that reflected his current emotion--the smile of greed. “By the way, young lady,” he continued, “I heard you getting along well with the Young Master from the noble Blackwood Family during your time away…”</p>\n<p>“Young Lady of Blackwood Family is my friend,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“Yeah but… I also heard in the next ngajen ceremony, Young Master Blackwood would grace us with his presence… is that true?”</p>\n<p>“I wouldn’t know.”</p>\n<p>“Hehe,” Elder Jhamil chuckled knowingly. “I think things would go well if you wear that dress during ngajen ceremony, young lady.”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh said a short and ambiguous reply and tried to get away from the bald elder. After she escaped in the lone corridor, she took out the dress from the box. The said dress was glimmering under the torchlight, yet, in spite of that, Bhela wasn’t happy the slightest bit.</p>\n<p>“This kind of thing…”</p>\n<p>A proper dress for ladies of southern people was hiding everything below the collarbone. Showing more, akin to invite men to do something indecent. Bhela wasn’t a conservative to follow Mossack customes down rigidly as shown from her cutting her hair short despite the gesture usually reserved for unavailable widows. But still, something like decency of girlhood, was something even someone duller than Bhela should have. Even daring courtesans would think twice to wear this kind of provocative dress to attend a festivity made by the Mossack majority.</p>\n<p>It was distasteful. Bhela didn’t want to think too much about it. After putting back the dress, Bhela walked again to the east wing of Malikh Family where her father was resting.</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim Malikh’s sick room once used as the family’s <b>Alchemist</b> workplace. It had long been vacant, thus usually used to care sick and injured people, as it had the most complete medicinal facility in the entire Malikh Family. Upon entering the room, Bhela found the thick pungent of herbs made her head light. And still she was amazed by how loyal her mother was to taking care of her father closely when servants would need to take a breather of fresh air ten minutes inside the sick room.</p>\n<p>“Father, mother, I’m back…. Did they send some food here?”</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh, the mother, was the one who replied to Bhela. “They did. Some people might forget about the patriarch’s little family but there are still good aunties working in the kitchen,” a middle-aged woman said with a hint of sadness, helplessness, and resentment.</p>\n<p>“Does mother want some hot tea? I’ll go fetch and say my thanks for those good aunties,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“You girl, sit down. You just returned today, now you want to run around doing errands?” Madam Malikh smiled weakly. “How’s the village, dear? Does it change from the way you remembered?”</p>\n<p>“Somes changed, others stay the same, mother,” Bhela said. She got to the table and put the box Elder Jhamil gifted, then took it off her mind. She then picked a random book from the shelves. “Can I stay here for a while?” she asked while showing the book to her mother, telling her the intention that she was going to read it there.</p>\n<p>The mother’s smile turned strained. At noon, she purposely told this daughter of hers to see around the village because she was afraid, if Bhela spent too much time in this room, she would feel uncomfortable by the thick medicinal smell and grow to hate the idea of staying. Even some maidservants a few years older than her were fidgeting and eyeing for the door every time they had duty to bring a meal here. Yet, looking from her daughter’s unflinching eyes, Madam Malikh was relented in the end.</p>\n<p>“Sit here,” the mother offered her chair for her daughter, while she sat down on the edge of her husband’s bed.</p>\n<p>Bhela’s moved with small, noiseless steps, trying not to wake up her father. But it was unfortunate that her father woke up nonetheless.</p>\n<p>“Le… letter…”</p>\n<p>The quivering voice escaped his cracking dry lips.</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh wanted to retort. Not the letter again. No matter how many times she read it aloud he still thirst for the letter as if it was the only salvation left for his life. Nonetheless, she surrendered and she picked a smooth, white paper made from wood--the kind which was expensive and usually used overseas--and began to read its content.</p>\n<p>“I understand your situation. But sending help from where I am takes a while. Ask Yulong’s help for now.”</p>\n<p>As if the letter was his assurance, Patriarch Ghalim Malikh closed his eyes again.</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at her mother who folded the recently opened letter, she asked. “Whose letter is that?”</p>\n<p>“Your great-grandmother who lived overseas,” her mother said.</p>\n<p>“I see.” Bhela wasn’t sure which relative her mother mentioned, but she decided to ask something else seeing her mother’s bad mood. “Why Great-grandmother mentioned something about Yulong? Isn’t Yulong the Yashura Family’s butler, mother?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know, I reckon she told us to rely on Yashura Family instead.”</p>\n<p>The strained smile on her mother’s face made Bhela realize that even her mother was reluctant when Yashura Family was mentioned. As a mother, she loved Bhela dearly, and was the one to believe in her daughter before everyone else. She believed in her daughter’s future. That was why she was first to oppose Bhela’s engagement when the sour rumors about the heir of the Yashura Family started. Never would she expect that her Malikh Family would be in dire straits so suddenly they needed Yashura Family’s help to get them out of this mess.</p>\n<p>“Have you sent someone to inform Yulong, mother?” Bhela asked.</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh shook her head. Bhela reckoned with Elder Jhamil gaining influence so fast, her mother wouldn’t know anyone to trust in this kind of situation.</p>\n<p>The girl then gave her mother a glass of water to ease her down. “I’ll let him know then,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Dear,” Madam Malikh brushed her daughter’s hair as she smiled helplessly, “showing your face in Yashura Family might complicate things…”</p>\n<p>Bhela patted her mother’s hands and assured her, “Don’t worry, mother,” she said, “I’ll ask favors from people I know from Elzhier Family.”</p>\n<p>Bhela thought her parents would go along with her arrangement. Madam Malikh hung open her lips as if she wanted to say something, but then she tightened her smile in the end. Unexpectedly, it was a weak voice that disagreed instead.</p>\n<p>“Bhela… don’t...” her father whispered weakly.</p>\n<p>“Dear?” mother leaned on toward his mouth.</p>\n<p>“What is it, father?” Bhela, too, leaned closer.</p>\n<p>“Don’t… ask… don’t… favor… purple...” the sickly patriarch’s voice turned hoarse and defragmented before he completed his sentences. Bhela and her mother quickly shushed him, they couldn’t afford to see the sick father forcing himself with this condition. Even after two minutes, he still struggled to tell his words to his daughter. Though eventually he fell to slumber by himself after his wife tried to put him to sleep with her eyes wet with tears.</p>\n<p>Beside her mother, Bhela picked a bamboo fan and used it to make a breeze for her father’s sleep to be more comfortable. Her expression was flat and straight the entire time, but inside, she was disturbed by the words her father failed to tell her.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>For as long as the Yashuras knew him, their Young Master Shira Yashura lived alone in his house. The only other person who should’ve been living here, his father, didn’t come home for months already. So ever since his uncle let him live in his house a few years back, Shira enjoyed an independent lifestyle he’d take for granted one of these days.</p>\n<p>At night, his schedule often filled with working on painting commissions Good-Natured Spirit gave him. Which, unfortunately, not something he wished for people to know. This part of his schedule was one of his secrets, if known by a certain meddlesome cousin, hell would surely be waiting for him.</p>\n<p>“I told you again and again,” a voice from behind him blurted, “you should’ve shown the boobs a little more.”</p>\n<p>Shira turned his head and groaned when he found the Nalaq’s annoying face a little bit too close. “Can you knock the door first?”</p>\n<p>“No way. I came through the wall. Door? What is door? Never use the thing since ages ago.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t creep up from behind, then. At least preserve your dignity as a Nalaq.”</p>\n<p>“I told you, don’t call me Nalaq,” Good-Natured Spirit hissed. “Anyway, boobs! The bweebs!! Make it more sexy! More bold and open!”</p>\n<p>“That’s not what we agreed on,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“Just a little, man. A little dot--tiny nipply dot--that’s all I’m asking for.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t push it, old man.”</p>\n<p>“Ah! You’re not fun anymore,” Good-Natured Spirit moaned in disatisfaction. In addition of Nalaq, Good-Natured Spirit was never fond of being called old. He died in his early thirty. So he retained the look, and he--according to himself--was still as handsome as ever. “Ah, forget it,” he waved his hand lazily. “Your drawings are second-rate porns anyway.”</p>\n<p>“You’re not paying for this one again?” Shira asked.</p>\n<p>“Not this one. Too safe. Don’t want it. At least make her boobs and butt bigger for the next time.”</p>\n<p>Shira sighed and wrapped it up for tonight. Everytime Good-Natured Spirit cancelled the commission's Shira wouldn’t have any choice but selling the paintings half-baked to a peddler he knew. Not even a half price, he’d be lucky if the rejected paintings would sell even one-fifth from Good-Natured Spirit’s usual payment.</p>\n<p>While Shira was tidying up his room, Good-Natured Spirit looked at the lady in the painting. The Nalaq said, “Hmm. I gotta say, man, despite your second-rate skill you’re natural when it comes to drawing faces. Especially the eyes. How should I say this… those aren’t the eyes of cheap bitches usually have, I tell you.”</p>\n<p>Shira didn’t know whether he should feel flattered or not. After he tidied the room and hid the naughty painting carefully, he prepared to go to sleep.</p>\n<p>“Oh, by the way,” Good-Natured Spirit said as Shira changed his shirt, “I’ve checked on your girl, brat. She’s a real good beauty, alright. Her talent too is not to be scoffed at. And also--boobs.”</p>\n<p>Shira glanced at him with tightened brows. “I’ll be troubled if they somehow trace it back to me in case the Young Lady of Malikh Family was assaulted.”</p>\n<p>“Hehe, relax man, I’ll never touch my buddy’s chick. We’re buddies, aren’t we?”</p>\n<p>Shira wanted to say no but he felt it’d be better for him not to comment on that. He then hurriedly kicked out the Nalaq so he could get some sleep in peace.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In almost all of Mossack race traditions, ngajen ceremony held monthly in villages near a mountain. It was one of those legacy of ancient Mossack that still around simply because of its practice brought safety to the people. Originally was a session of prayers and offerings to calm down Selaqs which dwelling on the mountains--they had to, because many stories being passed down in every families that even ancient tribe chieftains and heroes couldn’t do nothing if waves of Selaqs rampaged over the southern lands. Though, as the cost of ceremony getting more expensive as the time went on and getting more political, nowadays it became a time of feasts for big families to assert their surrounding influence. And a time of feasts where small and independent families gained side incomes from providing food and good for the big families’ feats. Ngajen ceremony was also the main reason why there was a weird rule for every Mossack-rooted families, tribes, and clans, that saying the leaders must be someone of a great cook--the majority of them were simply foodies.</p>\n<p>“And thus, Shira my boy--” the patriarch said as he played with his thick moustache, “--us southern people are naturally different from those imperialist western Haldeens and those warmongers feudalists of eastern Kaya. We don’t simply become leaders because of our noble bloodlines or merits and achievements in battle but simply because of food. This is an important lesson, my boy: no matter one hails from a noble blood or being a simple commoner, no matter one’s an enemy or ally, in the end, everyone’s going to eat happily and peacefully when we southern cooks shove foods up in their mouths. Remember that.”</p>\n<p>Shira Yashura quietly nodded. He didn’t plan to learn cooking from the start but, as the heir of Yashura Family, spending effort on foods probably one of the most important lessons before he became the next Patriarch of Yashura Family.</p>\n<p>“So you understand. Good. Sooner or later you’ll understand being strong is not everything, having talent is not everything,” the patriarch said. “Look at your father, for instance. He’s the only one in Badril Village who has an Unique class since… I don’t know, many many years. He’s pretty badass, eh? But why is that the one who ended up being the patriarch was me?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, Uncle Shuro, please do tell me.”</p>\n<p>Shuro Yashura, the patriarch uncle, smiled as he looked at his obedient nephew. He then half-bragging said, “Because he can only boil water, that’s why. Cooking is a great heritage of our ancestors thus those who have no talent on it as to be satisfied with being a second-rate Mossack. The only reason why people like me always ended up becoming the leader of clans because we Mossack appreciate food to a very high degree. Justice is food. Food is justice. With great cooking comes great responsibility.”</p>\n<p>But from the side a sour voice butted in, “Ohh. You’ll never know how much bullshit my father made up just now.”</p>\n<p>Uncle and nephew turned their heads to see a daughter pop her head from the window. Apparently, Mila Yashura had just returned from doing morning errands.</p>\n<p>“What are you guys doing anyway?” she asked. Apparently, in the kitchen, she saw her father and cousin shredding a ridiculous amount of coconuts. No one else was here in the kitchen, so Mila asked, “Did you two really do these by all yourselves?”</p>\n<p>“Of course,” her father, the revered patriarch, said as his hand vigorously shredded coconut. He couldn’t hide the annoying proud smile on his mustache filled face.</p>\n<p>“Since dawn?” Mila asked again suspiciously.</p>\n<p>“Food is justice. Justice is food. With great cooking comes great responsibility. Shredding coconut is one of the fundamental lessons for Shira to become a great patriarch in the future.”</p>\n<p>“Well,” Mila commented, “that’s dumb.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, girl! What do you know? You know nothing about the important philosophy behind every essence of coconuts,” Shuro Yashura exploded. “Since you a girl who don’t have to lead the family then probably you’ll never understand. You’ll never have to understand the hidden substance of every food you’ve eaten! Almost every Mossack delicacies made with coconuts. That Bulayak Satay sauce you like so much is made with coconut milk as a base! And don’t forget goat stew! And baked shredded coconuts cookies! And rendang! You name it. Coconuts have been granted us with delicious foods ever since ancestors were hunters-gatherers! Our very roots of being the descendants of ancient Mossack race can be traced as long as one ponder the mystery behind every shred of coconuts! Look at ancient empires! The ancient Aratararadararam Empire, for an instance, five thousands years ago, formed their empire solely by cultivating lots of coconut trees! They’re building civilizations relying only on the blessing of coconuts! That’s how great coconuts are! Only us who were born to lead our very empire can understand how miraculous are to be feeling joyous in pondering the great essence of shredded coconuts. You don’t know this much then you’re a dumb girl, eh. What a waste of a daughter you are!!” After taking a deep breath, Patriarch Shuro snorted at his impudent daughter, then glanced at Shira, smiling. “Isn’t that right, Shira my boy?”</p>\n<p>That was dumb. Even Shira knew that much. Because of that he kept his head hung low and focused on his task of shredding coconuts, pretending not to hear the question coming at him.</p>\n<p>“See?” the patriarch smirked. “He’s too absorbed by the grace of shredding coconuts he doesn’t notice my words.”</p>\n<p>Mila rolled her eyes, began to ignore her father. “Anyway, Shira! Have you heard the story about that girl Malikh beating up the best Archer kid single-handedly?”</p>\n<p>Shira of course knew about the archery duel that happened yesterday. Because Yashura Family and Malikh Family were entangled in a planned marriage, almost everyone in Yashura Family--including servants and clueless children--were talking about it. Yet he couldn’t raise his head and answer. Do that, and his uncle Shuro would know he only pretended to be interested in shredding coconuts. He’d only hurt his uncle’s feelings that way. Thus, in spite of Mila being overly loud today, all Shira needed to do was shredding and shredding and sometimes stopped to feel the shredded coconuts with his fingers, releasing a solemn sigh, as if he found something profound in every fiber of shredded coconuts.</p>\n<p>“That’s my boy, you understand all too well after all,” Shuro Yashura nodded in satisfaction. He was relieved his successor could be that enlightened by the grace of shredded coconuts. He then glared at his own blood daughter, who supposed to be the princess of the family, nagging so loudly that she stood in borderline of being a tomboy girl and a fussy aunty.</p>\n<p>“Oh, man, just leave him alone, would ya? Just think how many years for him to catch up with his girl--the more you hold him back the more people talk shit about him, father!”</p>\n<p>“Please dear! Is that how you talk with your father? I’m not holding him back, okay?” Patriarch Shuro Yashura then asked Shira, “do I hold you back, Shira my boy?”</p>\n<p>Shira further lowered his head and pretended not to hear that as if he was a turtle.</p>\n<p>“Better be careful. He’s too deep in coconuts he doesn’t even hear me,” the patriarch gave his daughter a glare.</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura rolled her eyes. She crouched and disappeared from the window view, then stood up again a moment later. Her hand clutching a pebble.</p>\n<p>The patriarch gawked, “Oi, what are you--”</p>\n<p>Mila aimed the pebble at Shira and it hit his head with an audible knock.</p>\n<p>“Thousands of gods!” Shira swore.</p>\n<p>“Too deep my ass,” Mila sneered. Unlike her father, she knew too well whenever Shira playing dumb.</p>\n<p>“What do you want?” Shira asked as he rubbed his head.</p>\n<p>“Let’s train your sword skill. You don’t want to face your fiancée with that crappy skill of yours, do you?”</p>\n<p>Shira glanced at his uncle unwillingly. “Do I have to meet with Bhela in her Family?”</p>\n<p>“That’s right, Shira my boy. You rarely visit other houses during ngajen ceremony but old folks from the Elder Council think this is a good time to show Malikh Family our good will,” Shuro Yashura said. “Remember to pray for their patriarch’s health too. He’s your father best friend, after all.”</p>\n<p>As if waiting for Patriarch Shuro’s completed his words, the door of the kitchen knocked at the very moment. A tall gray-haired old man entered. He had a posture that was straight and sharp, classy western-style butler uniform that hadn’t had looked worn out in spite no tailors around to know how to sew the said uniform, and his hand was balanced to hold a tray with a dozen elixirs on top of it with his left hand fingers, while his right hand rested on his back as if he followed an etiquette stranger to most of the villagers. He was the sole butler in Yashura Family--and perhaps, the only butler that ever employed in Badril VIllage.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira, this month’s elixirs your father sent for you have arrived,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Thank you, Yulong.”</p>\n<p>As usual, Shira drank elixirs his father sent abroad without a rest. The content was painfully bitter, thank goodness Yulong provided brown sugars for the boy to nibble after he drank those. His father Jhuro Yashura said--in a letter from abroad--that the elixirs were some kind of nutrient custom-made only for Shira, were expensive, so they could only afford them every one or two months.</p>\n<p>“How do you feel, Shira my boy?”</p>\n<p>Shira said as he munched a brown sugar to dismiss the bitter after taste. “Uh-hm. Better?”</p>\n<p>The family always thought they were a level-boost potion, Jhuro once sent a potion that could increase Shira’s level up to Level 3 in a single gulp after all. But the elixirs seemed to do nothing other than let Shira sleep comfortably at night. Still, his relatives, especially Mila, put their hopes on the resourceful Jhuro Yashura to nurture his own son--the heir of Yashura Family.</p>\n<p>Seeing the lack of enthusiasm in his nephew’s eyes, Patriarch Shuro laughed and said, “Haha. If those don’t work on your progress problems, don’t let it bother you! Your father worked very hard as an instructor in second-rank school and he’d definitely send a better elixir, like that one from three years ago!”</p>\n<p>“Oh,” Shira nodded. The elixir from three years ago was special. He knew it the moment he drank the potion. The warm feeling surrounding his manasphere was special, as with only drinking from one bottle, he leveled up 2 levels overnight.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>After that his uncle let him go out of the kitchen, since it was promised that Shira would do errands for his aunt every morning.</p>\n<p>When he was heading off for his duty, Shira Yashura got pranked by Good-Natured Spirit in the hallway, popped out his head from a wall and cried, “Boo!”--which Shira ignored because Yulong the butler was walking behind him.</p>\n<p>Yulong said with a polite baritone voice of his, “Young Master Shira, do you perhaps would visit the peddler today?”</p>\n<p>Shira looked at the butler. The matter about him doing business with a peddler wasn’t known to the family; but since Yulong wasn’t a Yashura and had been taking care of him since little, he eventually knew about the few investment deals that Shira never talked about. After collecting his thoughts, the boy replied to Yulong’s question, “Depends on the errand I receive, really. My aunt still hasn’t given my errands this morning,” the boy said.</p>\n<p>“I see, Patriarch Shuro took your time since early morning, so if madam doesn’t take pity for you then young master would finish today’s morning errands a little too late.”</p>\n<p>“The market would be too crowded if that happened,” Shira lamented. It couldn’t be helped. Boys and girls around ages of nine and sixteen--before they received coming-of-age ceremony--had to finish several trivial tasks each morning from both parents. It was a custom mainly to educate filial piety, though some smart parents and big family policies would give errands for the young’uns to make them do things that were beneficial for their futures, like street smarts and forming their own social circles outside the playmates they met everyday. Because his mother wasn’t here since he was a baby, and his father never came home for months, it was his aunt who always gave him errands.</p>\n<p>“Young Master,” Yulong stopped him again, “I’m glad for Young Master taking initiatives to improve your life. You grow too fast for this old butler to look after you. But as a child stepping into the adult world, please let me give you a small advice.”</p>\n<p>“I’m all ears, Yulong.”</p>\n<p>Yulong said, “You cannot guarantee everyone’s nature all around you, Young Master. Especially those who come approaching you with impure motives. I hope Young Master understands this, and to not make friends with nasty people.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit, who was around, snorted.</p>\n<p>Shira pretended he didn’t hear the Nalaq and nodded at the butler’s words. “You don’t have to worry about the peddler. Even though he’s been peddling for two years now, I found the fella got a pretty good sense.”</p>\n<p>“Hearing your words relieves me greatly. Thank you.”</p>\n<p>Afterward, Yulong excused himself as he needed to check the servants’ works for the arrangement of Ngajen Ceremony. The butler unassumingly walked on the side of the corridor, avoiding Good-Natured Spirit who was floating in the way, as if he knew there was something unpleasant floating in the way.</p>\n<p>“So long, fucker,” Good-Natured Spirit flashed his middle finger to Yulong’s back who just passed him by. Of course, the old butler didn’t show any reaction to his insult.</p>\n<p>“Why did you always do that to him?” Shira said to him with a frown.</p>\n<p>“This middle finger?” Good-Natured Spirit asked back.</p>\n<p>“No, the insult.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit grinned.</p>\n<p>“You know nothing about this middle finger, eh? Hehehh heh....”</p>\n<p>Yulong was someone Shira heartily respected. He always used polite language when talking to the butler. Because of that he was irked by the way Good-Natured Spirit sneered.</p>\n<p>“I need to sell the painting you rejected before the market becomes too crowdy. Let’s go,” he said. Bantering with Good-Natured Spirit would only make him more cocky, so Shira held the urge to humor his annoying behavior and headed off to the village’s market.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Back in the kitchen, Mila stayed with his father--who still shredding coconuts--while she read from a see-through board in front of her.</p>\n<p>“Ugh… his experience didn’t even change a single point,” Mila groaned.</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro too engrossed himself in coconut to realize what his daughter was doing just now. “You did a <b>Status Window</b> on him?”</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura nodded. Her face was sour though. “Look at this, old man. See what’s wrong with the number?”</p>\n<p>“Hah, his <b>Dodge Rating</b> getting crazier than before,” Shuro Yashura said with his fingers rubbing his moustache.</p>\n<p>“No! Look, father--his combat attributes, look closely! <b>Strength</b>, <b>Agility</b>, <b>Dexterity</b>! All of them pitifully underdeveloped. And look at the <b>Wisdom</b> attribute now!”</p>\n<p>“Ooh, his Wisdom’s pretty high. I knew his head’s pretty good. No wonder he could ponder the real meaning of shredded coconuts… he’s really a wise kid, after all.”</p>\n<p>“Please be serious, father. This is a serious matter.”</p>\n<p>“I’m serious,” Shuro the patriarch frowned. “And shredded coconut is a serious matter too!”</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura took a deep breath. Getting emotional over her father’s stupidity would only complicate the conversation.</p>\n<p>“Did you really hear the nickname they gave you...?” Mila asked him as she massaged her forehead. “It’s toothless Yashura. Toothless!”</p>\n<p>“Who said that?”</p>\n<p>“People.”</p>\n<p>“Fuck them people,” Shuro said. He never heard those old fogies calling him “toothless”, so he reckoned young'uns were the ones who came up with that. He sighed. For them to call this patriarch who always held the title of the best cook in Badril Village, those young people really didn’t have a good sense in them.</p>\n<p>“Because there’s Uncle Jhuro’s watching us from behind as a patriarch you can be toothless incompetent all you want, father, but--”</p>\n<p>“Oi, mind your words!”</p>\n<p>“--But!” Mila asserted despite her father started to pout after being called an incompetent, “but my generation is going to be harsh. No one as skilled and as strong as Uncle Jhuro appeared in the young’uns to be the guardian lion as our emblem is supposed to be.”</p>\n<p>“That is maybe but what are you trying to say here?”</p>\n<p>“What I’m saying is Shira can’t afford to be another toothless patriarch. You’re a support class, father, a <b>Specialist</b> like me. In our Badril Village history no matter how great your cooking is and no matter how wide our connections are if a conflict to arise a support class as a patriarch, nobody’d take us seriously--that is, unless another Unique Class who can afford to stay here in the village appears to scare them annoying people.”</p>\n<p>“Hoo, it seems you’ve been using your head a lot recently. That’s quite surprising.”</p>\n<p>Mila pursed her lips.</p>\n<p>“Unlike a certain carefree toothless patriarch, me and most family members concerned about Shira’s progress stuck as a Level 3 Novice. And what’s more, that girl Bhela Malikh--I don’t like what she did with her hair.”</p>\n<p>“Her hair?”</p>\n<p>“She cut her hair short. I confirmed it myself.”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro shook his head. He knew what his daughter was worrying about. “Girl, nephew Bhela has been away from the village and our dull way of thinking. She had been living with people in different cultures and customs these past two years. Maybe she cut her hair because she wants to follow fashion. Like that Aunty Yarly’s girl who suddenly has her lips red with lip balms, see? The young'uns are always doing it whenever foreigners come bringing their latest fads with them. You’re thinking too much.”</p>\n<p>“Why does everyone think Bhela Malikh is just some brainless girl who doesn’t know what she’s doing?” Mila Yashura frowned. “She’s smart, father. Even Shira knows she’s smart. You know what Shira said when I told him her fiancée has short hair now?--”</p>\n<p>She smirked.</p>\n<p>“--He said, ‘the engagement’s not going to work’.”</p>\n<p>“Bah! He’s been saying that shit for years!”</p>\n<p>“I know, I know!” Mila said. “But this time he’s serious. He said that with a punchable face as if he was saying ‘see, I told you’. His face looked punchable, I tell ya!”</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura was genuinely angry. This time, Patriarch Shuro Yashura didn’t immediately reply. He looked at his daughter, scratched his head, said, “So, in short, you worried about we can’t do nothing if Bhela is serious about cutting her hair to state her stance on her own engagement?”</p>\n<p>“Well, yeah! Of course I am. Only widows who cut hairs like that!”</p>\n<p>“You think it’s because she doesn’t like being paired with our Shira who is much weaker than her?”</p>\n<p>“Well, duh, old man, you’re still asking the obvious?”</p>\n<p>“Then don’t worry, look again at his status,” Shuro Yashura tossed back the status window back to his daughter. Its lifespan hasn't yet expired, so it was still showing Shira’s attributes and status as Level 3 Novice. “See what’s wrong in there?”</p>\n<p>Mila opened her mouth, “His combat attributes--”</p>\n<p>“No, look again!” Shuro cut off.</p>\n<p>Despite knitting her eyebrows, Mila still didn’t catch his father’s drift.</p>\n<p>Seeing his daughter had a hard time figuring it out, Shuro Yashura revealed, “His elemental affinity. See?”</p>\n<p>“It’s <b>Water</b> elemental affinity. It’s not that rare. What’s wrong with it?”</p>\n<p>“Well, he’s still a Novice. Getting a class still far away from him.”</p>\n<p>When a person reached the first barrier at Level 10 and got his class, there was a chance for him to aversed in one or more elementals and largely transformed, or perhaps even enhanced, the skills he would get from the class he acquired. Not everyone, but the chance was more than fifty-fifty. Aside from the rare ones, four base elementals that commonly appeared were <b>Fire</b>, <b>Wind</b>, <b>Lightning</b>, and <b>Water</b>--Mila wasn’t sure what so special for her cousin acquired an affinity over one of those base elementals.</p>\n<p>“Have you seen anyone with an elemental affinity in his Novice years?” her father asked.</p>\n<p>“It’s rare…” Mila was unsure, “can’t say I have.”</p>\n<p>“You haven’t. I have,” Shuro Yashura said. “Twenty seven years ago. Your Uncle Jhuro had a huge fight with grandfather and he ran away into the Mossy Forest behind the mountain--for nearly three weeks. He ate wild fruits. He ate monster meat also. But in the last three days he got unlucky and got poisoned by a snake monster ten levels above him. He struggled with death. Alone in that forest. But he lived. The fool then decided the forest was too dangerous for him and he returned back home.”--and got to experience a near-death situation again after their furious father almost pummeled him to pulp, Patriarch Shuro’s memories drifted.</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura listened. She knew the story of how his uncle survived alone in Mossy Forest--it was crazy, a kind of legend for the young’uns today. That was the first story amongst stories about the Badril Village’s last Unique Class warrior--Jhuro Yashura the Blackfang Swordsman--the story that first made him famous in the village for his unordinary bravery and recklessness.</p>\n<p>Shuro Yashura asked her daughter, “You know what happened after that, right?”</p>\n<p>She nodded.</p>\n<p>“Uncle awakened his rare <b>Poison</b> elemental affinity.”</p>\n<p>And Jhuro Yashura wasn’t even reached Level 10 back then.</p>\n<p>There was an unspoken law of the system most people didn’t know. A premonition, or sign, more appropriately, that if a Novice got an elemental before acquiring a class, chance was, an Unique class would be waiting for him.</p>\n<p>“See what I’m getting at?” Shuro Yashura said with a smile. “Time will reveal it, you don’t have to worry. Sooner or later, there’ll be another Unique class in our Yashura Family.”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>That morning the family getting busy preparing for ngajen ceremony; family officials, the servants, even brats too, were busy with their own errands. Usually with a few of copper kobe coins older kids could secretly pass their morning errands to the little ones--as lazier and richer kids like Shira wasn’t foreign to the practice, but unfortunately he couldn’t find some kids to bribe even on days like this. Not that he wasn’t happy about it. The errand his aunt gave him accidentally had something to do in the market, the destination he’d go to sell his painting today anyway.</p>\n<p>“Is it me or someone’s been staring at me since I stepped out of my family’s gate?”</p>\n<p>“It’s not you,” Good-Natured Spirit replied to Shira's question. “It seems the stalker Big-Boobed Sect sent today was particularly sloopy, kinda annoying.”</p>\n<p>“Oh yeah? How many of them are following me?” Shira asked half-heartedly.</p>\n<p>“What? You don’t believe them Big-Boobed Sect always spying on us?”</p>\n<p>Shira shrugged. Good-Natured Spirit was right--the boy didn’t believe his ramblings about all-girl sect always hiding in Badril Village’s shadows, especially with those padded words about them being beautiful and having bountiful bodies. He didn’t believe it because he still got some common sense. Not to mention hidden sects, even some decent clans and schools wouldn’t bother with ordinary places like Badril Village.</p>\n<p>And thus as he had feared, the market was already crowded by then. The moment Shira realized it, Good-Natured Spirit already drifted away by the sight of excitement in gambling dens and beautiful young wives from Elzhier Family sold street foods. As it turned out, it was stamped on the Nalaq’s mind to get off Shira as soon as they came to the market lest the boy’d use him for errands one way or another. The peddler Shira acquainted with was getting a good crowd as he laid his wares behind his wagon.</p>\n<p>“Monkey!”</p>\n<p>The peddler behind the wares turned his head. He had a funny face, a rare trait that made him resemble a monkey. And there was no coincidence everyone called him Monkey. When Monkey slightly wandered his eyes through the crowd and saw Shira, he waved his hands to the grunting customers and told them he’d close his shop for a while.</p>\n<p>“Well, well, isn’t this our Young Master Shira blessing us with his presence?” the smiling Monkey briskly approached as he rubbed his palms excitedly. “Can I help you young master?”</p>\n<p>Shira stepped back when Monkey got too close. “Monkey, you better stop being creepy whenever I come visit you.”</p>\n<p>“You hurt me, young master. There’s nothing creepy about our business relationship.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, it’s your face. Don’t make me regret selling my painting to you.”</p>\n<p>“Haha, surely you jest, Young Master Shira--I’m trying my best to maintain a professional face from now on!” Monkey said that then immediately took a small peek at the content. “Your skill is just getting better and better, master. I’m sure this will sell well, Master!”</p>\n<p>“What’s with the master thing?”</p>\n<p>“How dare for me to call you ‘Young Master’ while you yourself are already an expert at this stage?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t want our relationship getting creepier than it already is,” Shira said, then he took out a pouch of coins. “Anyways, I got an errand from my aunt, so give me the thirteen dried spices worth all this money.”</p>\n<p>“What kind of spice?”</p>\n<p>“All kinds of spices.”</p>\n<p>“Of course, of course, I’ll give you a discount, just to celebrate your improvement in the path of drawing, Master.”</p>\n<p>By the time Shira got himself a basketful of spices, Monkey’s grin getting more annoying. The stereotypical fat and slimy merchants looked innocent compared to him. After Shira threw a frowning glance at him, he <em>reluctantly</em> admitted, “Young master may not know this, but recently I’ve got an Alchemist partner with me who was trying to be independent from his family,” he said. “And I must tell you, young master, this family is a many-hundreds of years Alchemists family, and you also must know he’s not kicked out of incompetente--”</p>\n<p>Shira cut his roundabout pitching. “You want me to back the Alchemist?”</p>\n<p>“Mmm...yes….” Monkey nodded with a wry smile.</p>\n<p>The boy’s eyes wandered through the peddler’s wares before looked at him in the eyes. “Even I must tread through the game of cat and dog with the elders because of the rules,” he explained to Monkey, who in turn, could only smile helplessly.</p>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>Mossack’s custom dictates children who haven’t gone through their coming of age ceremony--usually at the age of sixteen--to not being involved in politics and commerce. This is the reason why Shira--as he mostly acquired money winning through streaks of chess games with Good-Natured Spirit--couldn’t recklessly flaunt his personal wealth in public.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>The risk of having a relationship gone sour with this young master, Monkey knew that. It was unlikely for an upstart peddler to be relied on by a future patriarch of a big family, and he wholeheartedly believed it was unwise to create a trivial misunderstanding with Young Master Shira Yashura. After all, it was only one year until Shira would have his own coming of age ceremony. Therefore, Monkey didn’t want to impose on the Young Master’s kindness too much and quickly changed the topic with something he’d prepared beforehand.</p>\n<p>“This is a <b>Boost Elixir</b> concocted by my partner. He might not a 2nd-Tier Alchemist yet but I assure you, Young Master Shira, the elixir’s potent power won’t lose against any experts you’ll find anywhere!” Monkey said with his over-excited sales pitch, which made him look more funny than usual, “This humble bottle was scientifically proven to increase a person’s level as long as he is below the age of twenty! To date, this Boost Elixir has 100% effectiveness in increasing the user’s level! Young master, you are very lucky--you can have this miraculous elixir just for half of the original price today!”</p>\n<p>Though it was clear Monkey meant no harm, Shira narrowed his eyes at the pedder.</p>\n<p>“Did someone pay you to make me drink it?” he asked suspiciously.</p>\n<p>“You jest again, Young Master… ha ha… haaa….” Monkey awkwardly laughed as he tried to hide his dampened enthusiasm. “Why don’t you try it first, Young Master Shira. You don’t have to pay if you didn’t get to graduate from Level 3 Novice.”</p>\n<p>Eventually, Shira drank the Boost Elixir within a gulp, not because he believed its miraculous effect, but because he was weak for free and discounted goods.</p>\n<p>“Your EXP bar didn’t even budge a little,” Monkey muttered with a meek voice.</p>\n<p>“The liquid is surprisingly well made though. Is this really made by someone you know?”</p>\n<p>“I said before, Young Master. The one who made this hailed from an old Alchemist family that even outside South Tiramikal Kingdom their last name still can be a pretty big deal. I’m pretty confident that--normally--this elixir will have a 100% success rate for leveling up whoever drinks it!”</p>\n<p>“Such a confident boast. Are you perhaps implying that my case is not <em>normally</em>?”</p>\n<p>“He hehe, you surely joke. You know that I don’t mean any harm, young master.”</p>\n<p>Shira of course knew it. And the other thing he also knew, that if it was a really impressive elixir he just drank by now, the usual Monkey wouldn’t utter a single phrase of the word “free”, regardless how many times the elixir failed to deliver its promise.</p>\n<p>Shira looked at Monkey suspiciously, “You’re Monkey, aren’t you? Not someone brainwashed by my family’s enemy or something like that? You know, by vampires.”</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira… now your joke is not even funny--something like a poor peddler to be brainwashed only appears in stories. Vampires are some unfounded folklore.”</p>\n<p>“Monkey I know is stupid. If not brainwashed, then he definitely manipulated to sell a fake elixir to someone from big families.”</p>\n<p>Before Monkey was able to retort that, a cold voice came from the wagon. “Young Master Yashura, I don’t mind if you pinpoint Monkey’s stupidity and make assumptions about him muchever you want. But to call my elixir is fake, I can’t stand and watch around anymore.”</p>\n<p>A man appeared from the wagon Monkey had, had an appearance of the stereotypical scholar Shira had in mind--though, by the way he crossed his arms pompously, he seemed to have a pride worthy of someone hailed from big families.</p>\n<p>“You’re the Alchemist?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, you call me Snake--don’t ask for my real name,” the Alchemist said.</p>\n<p>One would hide his name if he didn’t want to be associated with his family anymore. So Shira didn’t ask. He looked at the scholarly Alchemist, then at the peddler. One was the Snake and the other one was the Monkey.</p>\n<p>Shira found some sort of strange camradice between them. “I see, so both of you decided to be a partner for life.”</p>\n<p>“Not for life, no. Spare me. It’s better for me to ditch this stupid ape as soon as he outlives his usefulness.”</p>\n<p>“Heey! Don’t say ditching in front of me!” Monkey protested. Snake ignored him without pretense, making the impression that this scene was ordinary for them.</p>\n<p>Shira then asked Snake straightforwardly.</p>\n<p>“What kind of elixir is this?”</p>\n<p>“Didn’t Monkey tell you? A Boost Elixir. My latest masterpiece,” Snake replied.</p>\n<p>“You’re aware that your partner tried to sell your masterpiece at a half price, right? I don’t even have to pay, it was what he said before.”</p>\n<p>“It was my idea,” Snake said. “This is a simple business hack. I’m confident about my concoctions. After all, I experimented heavily on human anatomy--too heavy, even, to the point folks in my family want me gone for good. I’ve got nothing to lose here. That bottle is a prototype; it cost a lot so I planned to price it a lot.”</p>\n<p>“You want to use my bad reputation as a stepping stone, don’t you?” Shira asked with a sour smile.</p>\n<p>“Yes. Do you mind?”</p>\n<p>“No, I’d gladly make profit out of those trash talking they did behind my back--though, it seems you picked the wrong guinea pig to be your mascot for your ‘business hack’,” Shira said with a wry smile.</p>\n<p>Monkey nodded weakly. As a peddler from outside the village, he was always bothered by how nasty rumors could be, especially with some acquaintance he depended on sometimes as an important business partner.</p>\n<p>Seeing that they no longer had things to chat about, Shira said to them he’d consider putting some resources if he managed to gain some nod from the family elders after he went through the coming-of-age ceremony next year. And now that he finished selling Good-Natured Spirit’s rejected commision and completed the errand his aunt gave him, Shira then bid farewell to the two animal-nicknamed gentlemen.</p>\n<p>“Please wait, Young Master Shira.”</p>\n<p>Shira turned back his head again and found Snake, the one who called him, ran back to Monkey’s wagon to grab something.</p>\n<p>“Try to drink this one,” Snake said after trotting back hurriedly. “It’s alright, you don’t have to pay for this time too.”</p>\n<p>The current elixir Snake took out was the exact opposite from the previous one. Its container was beautiful and high-class, but the content was muddy and very low in quality. Hearing that this one was also free, Shira didn’t hesitate to drink it.</p>\n<p>The after taste was incredibly sour. Unlike any other bitter concocted elixirs or potions he ever drank. Although not much, Shira could feel his body warming up. He was surprised at the unexpected reaction.</p>\n<p>“Oohhhh!!!” Monkey cried as his eyes glued at Shira’s Status Window. “The EXP bar moved!”</p>\n<p>“What?” the surprised Shira glanced at Snake and asked slowly, “This one’s free, right?”</p>\n<p>It was in a single flash Shira did catch a strange dumbfoundedness in Snake eyes, like the result even came more shocking than him than either of Shira and Monkey. Yet the moment after he promptly regained his stoic exposure, then said to Shira, “Don’t worry, I don’t plan to take back my words,”</p>\n<p>The odd Alchemist put his hands at his back and walked back to his wagon. Before he climbed the wagon, he once again glanced at Shira, looking in a state of half-disbelief like expression</p>\n<p>As Snake disappeared into the wagon, Shira and Monkey exchanged glances.</p>\n<p>“He still has that kind of face even though he promises it to be free? You sure do have an odd friend.” Shira said.</p>\n<p>Monkey grinned. “Though an oddball, I never seen anyone with more talent in alchemy than him, like, ever.”</p>\n<p>After leaving Monkey to continue his stall, Shira saw Good-Natured Spirit again when he visited a food stall not far from Monkey’s wagon. He asked what he was doing, and the Nalaq told him there was a fool who bet a lot and won a lot in the gambling games. To lose against in gambling against someone with Good-Natured Spirit’s caliber, really--Shira sighed--he couldn’t wait for his coming-of-age ceremony next year so he too could farm on these gullible people in some friendly matches--just like what he did with Good-Natured Spirit for this past one year.</p>\n<p>“You know,” munching on some satays he bought from the market, Shira muttered when he headed home along with Good-Natured Spirit, “just then I drank this elixir that really could boost my EXP a little. I don’t know how the guy concocts it, but I have the feeling that I just drink some very expensive elixir for free.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, yeah?”</p>\n<p>On the way back to Yashura Family Shira told the Nalaq spirit about the Alchemist and his elixirs. He also told him that his status that usually wouldn’t react to normal elixirs this time moved a bit after he drank a strange low-quality elixir.</p>\n<p>“That Alchemist must be a nerd to be that sharp,” Good-Natured Spirit said as he floated lazily beside the boy.</p>\n<p>“He looks like that too. The peddler he partnered with also has some good sense in him. So I thought it’s not a loss for me to use all those foreign coins I got from you to invest on them for the next year.”</p>\n<p>“Hmm,” Good-Natured Spirit crossed his arms. “I think you should be worried.”</p>\n<p>“Worried? Why?”</p>\n<p>“You said that nerd Alchemist was the one who pushed that low-quality elixir to you, right?”</p>\n<p>“I got to drink that for free,” Shira emphasized.</p>\n<p>“He realized one little secret about you then,” Good-Natured Spirit said.</p>\n<p>Shira stopped walking. He looked at him with his head tilted.</p>\n<p>“What secret?”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit who floated before, spoke again.</p>\n<p>“You shouldn’t worry about it too much for now, brat. But, I advise you, if you are still holding dear for your lazy, peaceful village life, you should turn back and kill him right now.”</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-2/chapter-2":"<p>Dinner at Malikh Family; the family hall bustling with relatives who wanted to celebrate Bhela Malikh’s return. Even though the expensive Ngajen Ceremony drew near a good number of ducks and a goat were butchered along with their spice reserves taken out. There were laughters, there lots of people wanted to get on the good side of the only Young Lady of Malikh Family.</p>\n<p>But Bhela’s face was straight the whole time. Given choices, she’d rather have a small dinner with her mother and sick father right now.</p>\n<p>“I heard you went to Elzhier’s training facility as soon as you arrived, young lady,” a bald elder said with big smile. “That is no good. You just return home after four days of traveling. You must have a good rest first.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you for your concern, Elder Jhamil.”</p>\n<p>Bhela had experience with people during her two years abroad to know the meaning of smiles like Elder Jhamil’s--the kind of smile that didn’t reach eyes, the fake kind of smile. She always found it was uncomfortable whenever she met with one. Yet what was more uncomfortable was the fact she was the star of the party. Flatteries and congratulations flowing in. Bhela kept nodding her head and had a smiling expression on her face. No one really had a good time beside the ignorant families who came to find abundant foods to eat.</p>\n<p>Finally toward the end of the big dinner Elder Jhamil gave a few speeches and led everyone for their patriarch's health. Bhela hadn’t come home for two years, but she was alert enough to know the popular opinion going around inside the Malikh Family. She knew her father was disliked by many because the engagement he set up more than a dozen years ago, back when she wasn’t even able to speak yet, back when the Malikhs didn’t think much of it and didn’t know the girl back then would grow splendidly into a fair Young Lady. What she didn’t expect was that, Elder Jhamil, would point it out in front of other family members.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady, I’m sure you’re aware about it by now, but the one from Yashura Family is still stuck on the same level from back when you were leaving for your seminars.”</p>\n<p>“I’m aware, yes,” she said. “And?”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil smiled dryly at the question, he said, “With a partner that lazy he’d drag you sooner or later, wouldn’t he? Especially with special talent as yours, many would have second thoughts. But then how about you? Are you fine with that, Young Lady?”</p>\n<p>Bhela didn’t immediately say what was on her mind. She quietly picked the warm ginger drink they served her, drank it, while her eyes glanced at a certain direction where two maidservants who immediately glanced down the moment her eyes came into contact with theirs.</p>\n<p>Seeing that Bhela wasn’t that responsive with the idea, Elder Jhamil spoke further, “Young Lady, don’t worry, we as Malikhs only worried about your future. If you feel injustice in your heart, you must be brave, you must voice it out to your parents, Young Lady Bhela--all of us Malikhs support you for whichever path you choose! Isn’t that right, everyone?”</p>\n<p>“That’s right!” someone shouted. Then came more rougher voice--</p>\n<p>“We don’t fear those Yashura’s retaliation, Young Lady. You don’t have to be afraid they’ll come here to bully us because of that trash from Yashura Family!”</p>\n<p>“We support you, Young Lady!”</p>\n<p>“Don’t be afraid!”</p>\n<p>The dry smile on Elder Jhamil turned elated when people were chanting along with his cue. It was only when Bhela slowly put down the warm glass of ginger drink in her hand did they stop making ruckus, everyone was waiting for what Bhela was going to say next.</p>\n<p>“I think,” Bhela said with the remarkable cold expression of hers, “any engagement in the main family should be the main family’s business only.”</p>\n<p>She stopped. Not a single more soul dared to send her further flatteries until dinner was over. Even the bald Elder Jhamil, the most enthusiastic of all them, quietly sat back where he belonged.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>“Ah, young lady, please wait, Young Lady Bhela!” the bald Elder Jhamil chased her, trotting, with a box in his hands.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh frowned upon hearing the voice. But she hid her expression well as turned around and asked, “Is something the matter, Elder Jhamil?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, in fact, there’s one matter a bit inappropriate to deal in the family hall,” as soon as Elder Jhamil said that, he opened the box he carried. It was a dress. “It’s something that I get from a merchant who has a lot of dealing with people in the west. He told me this is apparently the current popular fashion for western nobles. I think it’s good for Young Lady.”</p>\n<p>Bhela studied Elder Jhamil’s expression. If the dress truly was a fashionable goods then the elder ought to have paid a quite of coins to get this. As far as Bhela Malikh remembered, Elder Jhamil she knew wasn’t this kind even when her father the patriarch married. Naturally with such an expensive homecoming gift, Bhela was alerted.</p>\n<p>“Thank you for your kindness, Elder Jhamil. Bhela will treasure this well.”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, you don’t have to mention it, Young Lady Bhela,” Elder Jhamil said with a laugh. Then, while rubbing his palms unconsciously, the bald elder began to smile--not a fake one like he usually did have, a genuine smile, one that reflected his current emotion--the smile of greed. “By the way, young lady,” he continued, “I heard you getting along well with the Young Master from the noble Blackwood Family during your time away…”</p>\n<p>“Young Lady of Blackwood Family is my friend,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“Yeah but… I also heard in the next ngajen ceremony, Young Master Blackwood would grace us with his presence… is that true?”</p>\n<p>“I wouldn’t know.”</p>\n<p>“Hehe,” Elder Jhamil chuckled knowingly. “I think things would go well if you wear that dress during ngajen ceremony, young lady.”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh said a short and ambiguous reply and tried to get away from the bald elder. After she escaped in the lone corridor, she took out the dress from the box. The said dress was glimmering under the torchlight, yet, in spite of that, Bhela wasn’t happy the slightest bit.</p>\n<p>“This kind of thing…”</p>\n<p>A proper dress for ladies of southern people was hiding everything below the collarbone. Showing more, akin to invite men to do something indecent. Bhela wasn’t a conservative to follow Mossack customes down rigidly as shown from her cutting her hair short despite the gesture usually reserved for unavailable widows. But still, something like decency of girlhood, was something even someone duller than Bhela should have. Even daring courtesans would think twice to wear this kind of provocative dress to attend a festivity made by the Mossack majority.</p>\n<p>It was distasteful. Bhela didn’t want to think too much about it. After putting back the dress, Bhela walked again to the east wing of Malikh Family where her father was resting.</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim Malikh’s sick room once used as the family’s <b>Alchemist</b> workplace. It had long been vacant, thus usually used to care sick and injured people, as it had the most complete medicinal facility in the entire Malikh Family. Upon entering the room, Bhela found the thick pungent of herbs made her head light. And still she was amazed by how loyal her mother was to taking care of her father closely when servants would need to take a breather of fresh air ten minutes inside the sick room.</p>\n<p>“Father, mother, I’m back…. Did they send some food here?”</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh, the mother, was the one who replied to Bhela. “They did. Some people might forget about the patriarch’s little family but there are still good aunties working in the kitchen,” a middle-aged woman said with a hint of sadness, helplessness, and resentment.</p>\n<p>“Does mother want some hot tea? I’ll go fetch and say my thanks for those good aunties,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“You girl, sit down. You just returned today, now you want to run around doing errands?” Madam Malikh smiled weakly. “How’s the village, dear? Does it change from the way you remembered?”</p>\n<p>“Somes changed, others stay the same, mother,” Bhela said. She got to the table and put the box Elder Jhamil gifted, then took it off her mind. She then picked a random book from the shelves. “Can I stay here for a while?” she asked while showing the book to her mother, telling her the intention that she was going to read it there.</p>\n<p>The mother’s smile turned strained. At noon, she purposely told this daughter of hers to see around the village because she was afraid, if Bhela spent too much time in this room, she would feel uncomfortable by the thick medicinal smell and grow to hate the idea of staying. Even some maidservants a few years older than her were fidgeting and eyeing for the door every time they had duty to bring a meal here. Yet, looking from her daughter’s unflinching eyes, Madam Malikh was relented in the end.</p>\n<p>“Sit here,” the mother offered her chair for her daughter, while she sat down on the edge of her husband’s bed.</p>\n<p>Bhela’s moved with small, noiseless steps, trying not to wake up her father. But it was unfortunate that her father woke up nonetheless.</p>\n<p>“Le… letter…”</p>\n<p>The quivering voice escaped his cracking dry lips.</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh wanted to retort. Not the letter again. No matter how many times she read it aloud he still thirst for the letter as if it was the only salvation left for his life. Nonetheless, she surrendered and she picked a smooth, white paper made from wood--the kind which was expensive and usually used overseas--and began to read its content.</p>\n<p>“I understand your situation. But sending help from where I am takes a while. Ask Yulong’s help for now.”</p>\n<p>As if the letter was his assurance, Patriarch Ghalim Malikh closed his eyes again.</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at her mother who folded the recently opened letter, she asked. “Whose letter is that?”</p>\n<p>“Your great-grandmother who lived overseas,” her mother said.</p>\n<p>“I see.” Bhela wasn’t sure which relative her mother mentioned, but she decided to ask something else seeing her mother’s bad mood. “Why Great-grandmother mentioned something about Yulong? Isn’t Yulong the Yashura Family’s butler, mother?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know, I reckon she told us to rely on Yashura Family instead.”</p>\n<p>The strained smile on her mother’s face made Bhela realize that even her mother was reluctant when Yashura Family was mentioned. As a mother, she loved Bhela dearly, and was the one to believe in her daughter before everyone else. She believed in her daughter’s future. That was why she was first to oppose Bhela’s engagement when the sour rumors about the heir of the Yashura Family started. Never would she expect that her Malikh Family would be in dire straits so suddenly they needed Yashura Family’s help to get them out of this mess.</p>\n<p>“Have you sent someone to inform Yulong, mother?” Bhela asked.</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh shook her head. Bhela reckoned with Elder Jhamil gaining influence so fast, her mother wouldn’t know anyone to trust in this kind of situation.</p>\n<p>The girl then gave her mother a glass of water to ease her down. “I’ll let him know then,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Dear,” Madam Malikh brushed her daughter’s hair as she smiled helplessly, “showing your face in Yashura Family might complicate things…”</p>\n<p>Bhela patted her mother’s hands and assured her, “Don’t worry, mother,” she said, “I’ll ask favors from people I know from Elzhier Family.”</p>\n<p>Bhela thought her parents would go along with her arrangement. Madam Malikh hung open her lips as if she wanted to say something, but then she tightened her smile in the end. Unexpectedly, it was a weak voice that disagreed instead.</p>\n<p>“Bhela… don’t...” her father whispered weakly.</p>\n<p>“Dear?” mother leaned on toward his mouth.</p>\n<p>“What is it, father?” Bhela, too, leaned closer.</p>\n<p>“Don’t… ask… don’t… favor… purple...” the sickly patriarch’s voice turned hoarse and defragmented before he completed his sentences. Bhela and her mother quickly shushed him, they couldn’t afford to see the sick father forcing himself with this condition. Even after two minutes, he still struggled to tell his words to his daughter. Though eventually he fell to slumber by himself after his wife tried to put him to sleep with her eyes wet with tears.</p>\n<p>Beside her mother, Bhela picked a bamboo fan and used it to make a breeze for her father’s sleep to be more comfortable. Her expression was flat and straight the entire time, but inside, she was disturbed by the words her father failed to tell her.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>For as long as the Yashuras knew him, their Young Master Shira Yashura lived alone in his house. The only other person who should’ve been living here, his father, didn’t come home for months already. So ever since his uncle let him live in his house a few years back, Shira enjoyed an independent lifestyle he’d take for granted one of these days.</p>\n<p>At night, his schedule often filled with working on painting commissions Good-Natured Spirit gave him. Which, unfortunately, not something he wished for people to know. This part of his schedule was one of his secrets, if known by a certain meddlesome cousin, hell would surely be waiting for him.</p>\n<p>“I told you again and again,” a voice from behind him blurted, “you should’ve shown the boobs a little more.”</p>\n<p>Shira turned his head and groaned when he found the Nalaq’s annoying face a little bit too close. “Can you knock the door first?”</p>\n<p>“No way. I came through the wall. Door? What is door? Never use the thing since ages ago.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t creep up from behind, then. At least preserve your dignity as a Nalaq.”</p>\n<p>“I told you, don’t call me Nalaq,” Good-Natured Spirit hissed. “Anyway, boobs! The bweebs!! Make it more sexy! More bold and open!”</p>\n<p>“That’s not what we agreed on,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“Just a little, man. A little dot--tiny nipply dot--that’s all I’m asking for.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t push it, old man.”</p>\n<p>“Ah! You’re not fun anymore,” Good-Natured Spirit moaned in disatisfaction. In addition of Nalaq, Good-Natured Spirit was never fond of being called old. He died in his early thirty. So he retained the look, and he--according to himself--was still as handsome as ever. “Ah, forget it,” he waved his hand lazily. “Your drawings are second-rate porns anyway.”</p>\n<p>“You’re not paying for this one again?” Shira asked.</p>\n<p>“Not this one. Too safe. Don’t want it. At least make her boobs and butt bigger for the next time.”</p>\n<p>Shira sighed and wrapped it up for tonight. Everytime Good-Natured Spirit cancelled the commission's Shira wouldn’t have any choice but selling the paintings half-baked to a peddler he knew. Not even a half price, he’d be lucky if the rejected paintings would sell even one-fifth from Good-Natured Spirit’s usual payment.</p>\n<p>While Shira was tidying up his room, Good-Natured Spirit looked at the lady in the painting. The Nalaq said, “Hmm. I gotta say, man, despite your second-rate skill you’re natural when it comes to drawing faces. Especially the eyes. How should I say this… those aren’t the eyes of cheap bitches usually have, I tell you.”</p>\n<p>Shira didn’t know whether he should feel flattered or not. After he tidied the room and hid the naughty painting carefully, he prepared to go to sleep.</p>\n<p>“Oh, by the way,” Good-Natured Spirit said as Shira changed his shirt, “I’ve checked on your girl, brat. She’s a real good beauty, alright. Her talent too is not to be scoffed at. And also--boobs.”</p>\n<p>Shira glanced at him with tightened brows. “I’ll be troubled if they somehow trace it back to me in case the Young Lady of Malikh Family was assaulted.”</p>\n<p>“Hehe, relax man, I’ll never touch my buddy’s chick. We’re buddies, aren’t we?”</p>\n<p>Shira wanted to say no but he felt it’d be better for him not to comment on that. He then hurriedly kicked out the Nalaq so he could get some sleep in peace.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In almost all of Mossack race traditions, ngajen ceremony held monthly in villages near a mountain. It was one of those legacy of ancient Mossack that still around simply because of its practice brought safety to the people. Originally was a session of prayers and offerings to calm down Selaqs which dwelling on the mountains--they had to, because many stories being passed down in every families that even ancient tribe chieftains and heroes couldn’t do nothing if waves of Selaqs rampaged over the southern lands. Though, as the cost of ceremony getting more expensive as the time went on and getting more political, nowadays it became a time of feasts for big families to assert their surrounding influence. And a time of feasts where small and independent families gained side incomes from providing food and good for the big families’ feats. Ngajen ceremony was also the main reason why there was a weird rule for every Mossack-rooted families, tribes, and clans, that saying the leaders must be someone of a great cook--the majority of them were simply foodies.</p>\n<p>“And thus, Shira my boy--” the patriarch said as he played with his thick moustache, “--us southern people are naturally different from those imperialist western Haldeens and those warmongers feudalists of eastern Kaya. We don’t simply become leaders because of our noble bloodlines or merits and achievements in battle but simply because of food. This is an important lesson, my boy: no matter one hails from a noble blood or being a simple commoner, no matter one’s an enemy or ally, in the end, everyone’s going to eat happily and peacefully when we southern cooks shove foods up in their mouths. Remember that.”</p>\n<p>Shira Yashura quietly nodded. He didn’t plan to learn cooking from the start but, as the heir of Yashura Family, spending effort on foods probably one of the most important lessons before he became the next Patriarch of Yashura Family.</p>\n<p>“So you understand. Good. Sooner or later you’ll understand being strong is not everything, having talent is not everything,” the patriarch said. “Look at your father, for instance. He’s the only one in Badril Village who has an Unique class since… I don’t know, many many years. He’s pretty badass, eh? But why is that the one who ended up being the patriarch was me?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, Uncle Shuro, please do tell me.”</p>\n<p>Shuro Yashura, the patriarch uncle, smiled as he looked at his obedient nephew. He then half-bragging said, “Because he can only boil water, that’s why. Cooking is a great heritage of our ancestors thus those who have no talent on it as to be satisfied with being a second-rate Mossack. The only reason why people like me always ended up becoming the leader of clans because we Mossack appreciate food to a very high degree. Justice is food. Food is justice. With great cooking comes great responsibility.”</p>\n<p>But from the side a sour voice butted in, “Ohh. You’ll never know how much bullshit my father made up just now.”</p>\n<p>Uncle and nephew turned their heads to see a daughter pop her head from the window. Apparently, Mila Yashura had just returned from doing morning errands.</p>\n<p>“What are you guys doing anyway?” she asked. Apparently, in the kitchen, she saw her father and cousin shredding a ridiculous amount of coconuts. No one else was here in the kitchen, so Mila asked, “Did you two really do these by all yourselves?”</p>\n<p>“Of course,” her father, the revered patriarch, said as his hand vigorously shredded coconut. He couldn’t hide the annoying proud smile on his mustache filled face.</p>\n<p>“Since dawn?” Mila asked again suspiciously.</p>\n<p>“Food is justice. Justice is food. With great cooking comes great responsibility. Shredding coconut is one of the fundamental lessons for Shira to become a great patriarch in the future.”</p>\n<p>“Well,” Mila commented, “that’s dumb.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, girl! What do you know? You know nothing about the important philosophy behind every essence of coconuts,” Shuro Yashura exploded. “Since you a girl who don’t have to lead the family then probably you’ll never understand. You’ll never have to understand the hidden substance of every food you’ve eaten! Almost every Mossack delicacies made with coconuts. That Bulayak Satay sauce you like so much is made with coconut milk as a base! And don’t forget goat stew! And baked shredded coconuts cookies! And rendang! You name it. Coconuts have been granted us with delicious foods ever since ancestors were hunters-gatherers! Our very roots of being the descendants of ancient Mossack race can be traced as long as one ponder the mystery behind every shred of coconuts! Look at ancient empires! The ancient Aratararadararam Empire, for an instance, five thousands years ago, formed their empire solely by cultivating lots of coconut trees! They’re building civilizations relying only on the blessing of coconuts! That’s how great coconuts are! Only us who were born to lead our very empire can understand how miraculous are to be feeling joyous in pondering the great essence of shredded coconuts. You don’t know this much then you’re a dumb girl, eh. What a waste of a daughter you are!!” After taking a deep breath, Patriarch Shuro snorted at his impudent daughter, then glanced at Shira, smiling. “Isn’t that right, Shira my boy?”</p>\n<p>That was dumb. Even Shira knew that much. Because of that he kept his head hung low and focused on his task of shredding coconuts, pretending not to hear the question coming at him.</p>\n<p>“See?” the patriarch smirked. “He’s too absorbed by the grace of shredding coconuts he doesn’t notice my words.”</p>\n<p>Mila rolled her eyes, began to ignore her father. “Anyway, Shira! Have you heard the story about that girl Malikh beating up the best Archer kid single-handedly?”</p>\n<p>Shira of course knew about the archery duel that happened yesterday. Because Yashura Family and Malikh Family were entangled in a planned marriage, almost everyone in Yashura Family--including servants and clueless children--were talking about it. Yet he couldn’t raise his head and answer. Do that, and his uncle Shuro would know he only pretended to be interested in shredding coconuts. He’d only hurt his uncle’s feelings that way. Thus, in spite of Mila being overly loud today, all Shira needed to do was shredding and shredding and sometimes stopped to feel the shredded coconuts with his fingers, releasing a solemn sigh, as if he found something profound in every fiber of shredded coconuts.</p>\n<p>“That’s my boy, you understand all too well after all,” Shuro Yashura nodded in satisfaction. He was relieved his successor could be that enlightened by the grace of shredded coconuts. He then glared at his own blood daughter, who supposed to be the princess of the family, nagging so loudly that she stood in borderline of being a tomboy girl and a fussy aunty.</p>\n<p>“Oh, man, just leave him alone, would ya? Just think how many years for him to catch up with his girl--the more you hold him back the more people talk shit about him, father!”</p>\n<p>“Please dear! Is that how you talk with your father? I’m not holding him back, okay?” Patriarch Shuro Yashura then asked Shira, “do I hold you back, Shira my boy?”</p>\n<p>Shira further lowered his head and pretended not to hear that as if he was a turtle.</p>\n<p>“Better be careful. He’s too deep in coconuts he doesn’t even hear me,” the patriarch gave his daughter a glare.</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura rolled her eyes. She crouched and disappeared from the window view, then stood up again a moment later. Her hand clutching a pebble.</p>\n<p>The patriarch gawked, “Oi, what are you--”</p>\n<p>Mila aimed the pebble at Shira and it hit his head with an audible knock.</p>\n<p>“Thousands of gods!” Shira swore.</p>\n<p>“Too deep my ass,” Mila sneered. Unlike her father, she knew too well whenever Shira playing dumb.</p>\n<p>“What do you want?” Shira asked as he rubbed his head.</p>\n<p>“Let’s train your sword skill. You don’t want to face your fiancée with that crappy skill of yours, do you?”</p>\n<p>Shira glanced at his uncle unwillingly. “Do I have to meet with Bhela in her Family?”</p>\n<p>“That’s right, Shira my boy. You rarely visit other houses during ngajen ceremony but old folks from the Elder Council think this is a good time to show Malikh Family our good will,” Shuro Yashura said. “Remember to pray for their patriarch’s health too. He’s your father best friend, after all.”</p>\n<p>As if waiting for Patriarch Shuro’s completed his words, the door of the kitchen knocked at the very moment. A tall gray-haired old man entered. He had a posture that was straight and sharp, classy western-style butler uniform that hadn’t had looked worn out in spite no tailors around to know how to sew the said uniform, and his hand was balanced to hold a tray with a dozen elixirs on top of it with his left hand fingers, while his right hand rested on his back as if he followed an etiquette stranger to most of the villagers. He was the sole butler in Yashura Family--and perhaps, the only butler that ever employed in Badril VIllage.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira, this month’s elixirs your father sent for you have arrived,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Thank you, Yulong.”</p>\n<p>As usual, Shira drank elixirs his father sent abroad without a rest. The content was painfully bitter, thank goodness Yulong provided brown sugars for the boy to nibble after he drank those. His father Jhuro Yashura said--in a letter from abroad--that the elixirs were some kind of nutrient custom-made only for Shira, were expensive, so they could only afford them every one or two months.</p>\n<p>“How do you feel, Shira my boy?”</p>\n<p>Shira said as he munched a brown sugar to dismiss the bitter after taste. “Uh-hm. Better?”</p>\n<p>The family always thought they were a level-boost potion, Jhuro once sent a potion that could increase Shira’s level up to Level 3 in a single gulp after all. But the elixirs seemed to do nothing other than let Shira sleep comfortably at night. Still, his relatives, especially Mila, put their hopes on the resourceful Jhuro Yashura to nurture his own son--the heir of Yashura Family.</p>\n<p>Seeing the lack of enthusiasm in his nephew’s eyes, Patriarch Shuro laughed and said, “Haha. If those don’t work on your progress problems, don’t let it bother you! Your father worked very hard as an instructor in second-rank school and he’d definitely send a better elixir, like that one from three years ago!”</p>\n<p>“Oh,” Shira nodded. The elixir from three years ago was special. He knew it the moment he drank the potion. The warm feeling surrounding his manasphere was special, as with only drinking from one bottle, he leveled up 2 levels overnight.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>After that his uncle let him go out of the kitchen, since it was promised that Shira would do errands for his aunt every morning.</p>\n<p>When he was heading off for his duty, Shira Yashura got pranked by Good-Natured Spirit in the hallway, popped out his head from a wall and cried, “Boo!”--which Shira ignored because Yulong the butler was walking behind him.</p>\n<p>Yulong said with a polite baritone voice of his, “Young Master Shira, do you perhaps would visit the peddler today?”</p>\n<p>Shira looked at the butler. The matter about him doing business with a peddler wasn’t known to the family; but since Yulong wasn’t a Yashura and had been taking care of him since little, he eventually knew about the few investment deals that Shira never talked about. After collecting his thoughts, the boy replied to Yulong’s question, “Depends on the errand I receive, really. My aunt still hasn’t given my errands this morning,” the boy said.</p>\n<p>“I see, Patriarch Shuro took your time since early morning, so if madam doesn’t take pity for you then young master would finish today’s morning errands a little too late.”</p>\n<p>“The market would be too crowded if that happened,” Shira lamented. It couldn’t be helped. Boys and girls around ages of nine and sixteen--before they received coming-of-age ceremony--had to finish several trivial tasks each morning from both parents. It was a custom mainly to educate filial piety, though some smart parents and big family policies would give errands for the young’uns to make them do things that were beneficial for their futures, like street smarts and forming their own social circles outside the playmates they met everyday. Because his mother wasn’t here since he was a baby, and his father never came home for months, it was his aunt who always gave him errands.</p>\n<p>“Young Master,” Yulong stopped him again, “I’m glad for Young Master taking initiatives to improve your life. You grow too fast for this old butler to look after you. But as a child stepping into the adult world, please let me give you a small advice.”</p>\n<p>“I’m all ears, Yulong.”</p>\n<p>Yulong said, “You cannot guarantee everyone’s nature all around you, Young Master. Especially those who come approaching you with impure motives. I hope Young Master understands this, and to not make friends with nasty people.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit, who was around, snorted.</p>\n<p>Shira pretended he didn’t hear the Nalaq and nodded at the butler’s words. “You don’t have to worry about the peddler. Even though he’s been peddling for two years now, I found the fella got a pretty good sense.”</p>\n<p>“Hearing your words relieves me greatly. Thank you.”</p>\n<p>Afterward, Yulong excused himself as he needed to check the servants’ works for the arrangement of Ngajen Ceremony. The butler unassumingly walked on the side of the corridor, avoiding Good-Natured Spirit who was floating in the way, as if he knew there was something unpleasant floating in the way.</p>\n<p>“So long, fucker,” Good-Natured Spirit flashed his middle finger to Yulong’s back who just passed him by. Of course, the old butler didn’t show any reaction to his insult.</p>\n<p>“Why did you always do that to him?” Shira said to him with a frown.</p>\n<p>“This middle finger?” Good-Natured Spirit asked back.</p>\n<p>“No, the insult.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit grinned.</p>\n<p>“You know nothing about this middle finger, eh? Hehehh heh....”</p>\n<p>Yulong was someone Shira heartily respected. He always used polite language when talking to the butler. Because of that he was irked by the way Good-Natured Spirit sneered.</p>\n<p>“I need to sell the painting you rejected before the market becomes too crowdy. Let’s go,” he said. Bantering with Good-Natured Spirit would only make him more cocky, so Shira held the urge to humor his annoying behavior and headed off to the village’s market.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Back in the kitchen, Mila stayed with his father--who still shredding coconuts--while she read from a see-through board in front of her.</p>\n<p>“Ugh… his experience didn’t even change a single point,” Mila groaned.</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro too engrossed himself in coconut to realize what his daughter was doing just now. “You did a <b>Status Window</b> on him?”</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura nodded. Her face was sour though. “Look at this, old man. See what’s wrong with the number?”</p>\n<p>“Hah, his <b>Dodge Rating</b> getting crazier than before,” Shuro Yashura said with his fingers rubbing his moustache.</p>\n<p>“No! Look, father--his combat attributes, look closely! <b>Strength</b>, <b>Agility</b>, <b>Dexterity</b>! All of them pitifully underdeveloped. And look at the <b>Wisdom</b> attribute now!”</p>\n<p>“Ooh, his Wisdom’s pretty high. I knew his head’s pretty good. No wonder he could ponder the real meaning of shredded coconuts… he’s really a wise kid, after all.”</p>\n<p>“Please be serious, father. This is a serious matter.”</p>\n<p>“I’m serious,” Shuro the patriarch frowned. “And shredded coconut is a serious matter too!”</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura took a deep breath. Getting emotional over her father’s stupidity would only complicate the conversation.</p>\n<p>“Did you really hear the nickname they gave you...?” Mila asked him as she massaged her forehead. “It’s toothless Yashura. Toothless!”</p>\n<p>“Who said that?”</p>\n<p>“People.”</p>\n<p>“Fuck them people,” Shuro said. He never heard those old fogies calling him “toothless”, so he reckoned young'uns were the ones who came up with that. He sighed. For them to call this patriarch who always held the title of the best cook in Badril Village, those young people really didn’t have a good sense in them.</p>\n<p>“Because there’s Uncle Jhuro’s watching us from behind as a patriarch you can be toothless incompetent all you want, father, but--”</p>\n<p>“Oi, mind your words!”</p>\n<p>“--But!” Mila asserted despite her father started to pout after being called an incompetent, “but my generation is going to be harsh. No one as skilled and as strong as Uncle Jhuro appeared in the young’uns to be the guardian lion as our emblem is supposed to be.”</p>\n<p>“That is maybe but what are you trying to say here?”</p>\n<p>“What I’m saying is Shira can’t afford to be another toothless patriarch. You’re a support class, father, a <b>Specialist</b> like me. In our Badril Village history no matter how great your cooking is and no matter how wide our connections are if a conflict to arise a support class as a patriarch, nobody’d take us seriously--that is, unless another Unique Class who can afford to stay here in the village appears to scare them annoying people.”</p>\n<p>“Hoo, it seems you’ve been using your head a lot recently. That’s quite surprising.”</p>\n<p>Mila pursed her lips.</p>\n<p>“Unlike a certain carefree toothless patriarch, me and most family members concerned about Shira’s progress stuck as a Level 3 Novice. And what’s more, that girl Bhela Malikh--I don’t like what she did with her hair.”</p>\n<p>“Her hair?”</p>\n<p>“She cut her hair short. I confirmed it myself.”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro shook his head. He knew what his daughter was worrying about. “Girl, nephew Bhela has been away from the village and our dull way of thinking. She had been living with people in different cultures and customs these past two years. Maybe she cut her hair because she wants to follow fashion. Like that Aunty Yarly’s girl who suddenly has her lips red with lip balms, see? The young'uns are always doing it whenever foreigners come bringing their latest fads with them. You’re thinking too much.”</p>\n<p>“Why does everyone think Bhela Malikh is just some brainless girl who doesn’t know what she’s doing?” Mila Yashura frowned. “She’s smart, father. Even Shira knows she’s smart. You know what Shira said when I told him her fiancée has short hair now?--”</p>\n<p>She smirked.</p>\n<p>“--He said, ‘the engagement’s not going to work’.”</p>\n<p>“Bah! He’s been saying that shit for years!”</p>\n<p>“I know, I know!” Mila said. “But this time he’s serious. He said that with a punchable face as if he was saying ‘see, I told you’. His face looked punchable, I tell ya!”</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura was genuinely angry. This time, Patriarch Shuro Yashura didn’t immediately reply. He looked at his daughter, scratched his head, said, “So, in short, you worried about we can’t do nothing if Bhela is serious about cutting her hair to state her stance on her own engagement?”</p>\n<p>“Well, yeah! Of course I am. Only widows who cut hairs like that!”</p>\n<p>“You think it’s because she doesn’t like being paired with our Shira who is much weaker than her?”</p>\n<p>“Well, duh, old man, you’re still asking the obvious?”</p>\n<p>“Then don’t worry, look again at his status,” Shuro Yashura tossed back the status window back to his daughter. Its lifespan hasn't yet expired, so it was still showing Shira’s attributes and status as Level 3 Novice. “See what’s wrong in there?”</p>\n<p>Mila opened her mouth, “His combat attributes--”</p>\n<p>“No, look again!” Shuro cut off.</p>\n<p>Despite knitting her eyebrows, Mila still didn’t catch his father’s drift.</p>\n<p>Seeing his daughter had a hard time figuring it out, Shuro Yashura revealed, “His elemental affinity. See?”</p>\n<p>“It’s <b>Water</b> elemental affinity. It’s not that rare. What’s wrong with it?”</p>\n<p>“Well, he’s still a Novice. Getting a class still far away from him.”</p>\n<p>When a person reached the first barrier at Level 10 and got his class, there was a chance for him to aversed in one or more elementals and largely transformed, or perhaps even enhanced, the skills he would get from the class he acquired. Not everyone, but the chance was more than fifty-fifty. Aside from the rare ones, four base elementals that commonly appeared were <b>Fire</b>, <b>Wind</b>, <b>Lightning</b>, and <b>Water</b>--Mila wasn’t sure what so special for her cousin acquired an affinity over one of those base elementals.</p>\n<p>“Have you seen anyone with an elemental affinity in his Novice years?” her father asked.</p>\n<p>“It’s rare…” Mila was unsure, “can’t say I have.”</p>\n<p>“You haven’t. I have,” Shuro Yashura said. “Twenty seven years ago. Your Uncle Jhuro had a huge fight with grandfather and he ran away into the Mossy Forest behind the mountain--for nearly three weeks. He ate wild fruits. He ate monster meat also. But in the last three days he got unlucky and got poisoned by a snake monster ten levels above him. He struggled with death. Alone in that forest. But he lived. The fool then decided the forest was too dangerous for him and he returned back home.”--and got to experience a near-death situation again after their furious father almost pummeled him to pulp, Patriarch Shuro’s memories drifted.</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura listened. She knew the story of how his uncle survived alone in Mossy Forest--it was crazy, a kind of legend for the young’uns today. That was the first story amongst stories about the Badril Village’s last Unique Class warrior--Jhuro Yashura the Blackfang Swordsman--the story that first made him famous in the village for his unordinary bravery and recklessness.</p>\n<p>Shuro Yashura asked her daughter, “You know what happened after that, right?”</p>\n<p>She nodded.</p>\n<p>“Uncle awakened his rare <b>Poison</b> elemental affinity.”</p>\n<p>And Jhuro Yashura wasn’t even reached Level 10 back then.</p>\n<p>There was an unspoken law of the system most people didn’t know. A premonition, or sign, more appropriately, that if a Novice got an elemental before acquiring a class, chance was, an Unique class would be waiting for him.</p>\n<p>“See what I’m getting at?” Shuro Yashura said with a smile. “Time will reveal it, you don’t have to worry. Sooner or later, there’ll be another Unique class in our Yashura Family.”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>That morning the family getting busy preparing for ngajen ceremony; family officials, the servants, even brats too, were busy with their own errands. Usually with a few of copper kobe coins older kids could secretly pass their morning errands to the little ones--as lazier and richer kids like Shira wasn’t foreign to the practice, but unfortunately he couldn’t find some kids to bribe even on days like this. Not that he wasn’t happy about it. The errand his aunt gave him accidentally had something to do in the market, the destination he’d go to sell his painting today anyway.</p>\n<p>“Is it me or someone’s been staring at me since I stepped out of my family’s gate?”</p>\n<p>“It’s not you,” Good-Natured Spirit replied to Shira's question. “It seems the stalker Big-Boobed Sect sent today was particularly sloopy, kinda annoying.”</p>\n<p>“Oh yeah? How many of them are following me?” Shira asked half-heartedly.</p>\n<p>“What? You don’t believe them Big-Boobed Sect always spying on us?”</p>\n<p>Shira shrugged. Good-Natured Spirit was right--the boy didn’t believe his ramblings about all-girl sect always hiding in Badril Village’s shadows, especially with those padded words about them being beautiful and having bountiful bodies. He didn’t believe it because he still got some common sense. Not to mention hidden sects, even some decent clans and schools wouldn’t bother with ordinary places like Badril Village.</p>\n<p>And thus as he had feared, the market was already crowded by then. The moment Shira realized it, Good-Natured Spirit already drifted away by the sight of excitement in gambling dens and beautiful young wives from Elzhier Family sold street foods. As it turned out, it was stamped on the Nalaq’s mind to get off Shira as soon as they came to the market lest the boy’d use him for errands one way or another. The peddler Shira acquainted with was getting a good crowd as he laid his wares behind his wagon.</p>\n<p>“Monkey!”</p>\n<p>The peddler behind the wares turned his head. He had a funny face, a rare trait that made him resemble a monkey. And there was no coincidence everyone called him Monkey. When Monkey slightly wandered his eyes through the crowd and saw Shira, he waved his hands to the grunting customers and told them he’d close his shop for a while.</p>\n<p>“Well, well, isn’t this our Young Master Shira blessing us with his presence?” the smiling Monkey briskly approached as he rubbed his palms excitedly. “Can I help you young master?”</p>\n<p>Shira stepped back when Monkey got too close. “Monkey, you better stop being creepy whenever I come visit you.”</p>\n<p>“You hurt me, young master. There’s nothing creepy about our business relationship.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, it’s your face. Don’t make me regret selling my painting to you.”</p>\n<p>“Haha, surely you jest, Young Master Shira--I’m trying my best to maintain a professional face from now on!” Monkey said that then immediately took a small peek at the content. “Your skill is just getting better and better, master. I’m sure this will sell well, Master!”</p>\n<p>“What’s with the master thing?”</p>\n<p>“How dare for me to call you ‘Young Master’ while you yourself are already an expert at this stage?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t want our relationship getting creepier than it already is,” Shira said, then he took out a pouch of coins. “Anyways, I got an errand from my aunt, so give me the thirteen dried spices worth all this money.”</p>\n<p>“What kind of spice?”</p>\n<p>“All kinds of spices.”</p>\n<p>“Of course, of course, I’ll give you a discount, just to celebrate your improvement in the path of drawing, Master.”</p>\n<p>By the time Shira got himself a basketful of spices, Monkey’s grin getting more annoying. The stereotypical fat and slimy merchants looked innocent compared to him. After Shira threw a frowning glance at him, he <em>reluctantly</em> admitted, “Young master may not know this, but recently I’ve got an Alchemist partner with me who was trying to be independent from his family,” he said. “And I must tell you, young master, this family is a many-hundreds of years Alchemists family, and you also must know he’s not kicked out of incompetente--”</p>\n<p>Shira cut his roundabout pitching. “You want me to back the Alchemist?”</p>\n<p>“Mmm...yes….” Monkey nodded with a wry smile.</p>\n<p>The boy’s eyes wandered through the peddler’s wares before looked at him in the eyes. “Even I must tread through the game of cat and dog with the elders because of the rules,” he explained to Monkey, who in turn, could only smile helplessly.</p>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>Mossack’s custom dictates children who haven’t gone through their coming of age ceremony--usually at the age of sixteen--to not being involved in politics and commerce. This is the reason why Shira--as he mostly acquired money winning through streaks of chess games with Good-Natured Spirit--couldn’t recklessly flaunt his personal wealth in public.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>The risk of having a relationship gone sour with this young master, Monkey knew that. It was unlikely for an upstart peddler to be relied on by a future patriarch of a big family, and he wholeheartedly believed it was unwise to create a trivial misunderstanding with Young Master Shira Yashura. After all, it was only one year until Shira would have his own coming of age ceremony. Therefore, Monkey didn’t want to impose on the Young Master’s kindness too much and quickly changed the topic with something he’d prepared beforehand.</p>\n<p>“This is a <b>Boost Elixir</b> concocted by my partner. He might not a 2nd-Tier Alchemist yet but I assure you, Young Master Shira, the elixir’s potent power won’t lose against any experts you’ll find anywhere!” Monkey said with his over-excited sales pitch, which made him look more funny than usual, “This humble bottle was scientifically proven to increase a person’s level as long as he is below the age of twenty! To date, this Boost Elixir has 100% effectiveness in increasing the user’s level! Young master, you are very lucky--you can have this miraculous elixir just for half of the original price today!”</p>\n<p>Though it was clear Monkey meant no harm, Shira narrowed his eyes at the pedder.</p>\n<p>“Did someone pay you to make me drink it?” he asked suspiciously.</p>\n<p>“You jest again, Young Master… ha ha… haaa….” Monkey awkwardly laughed as he tried to hide his dampened enthusiasm. “Why don’t you try it first, Young Master Shira. You don’t have to pay if you didn’t get to graduate from Level 3 Novice.”</p>\n<p>Eventually, Shira drank the Boost Elixir within a gulp, not because he believed its miraculous effect, but because he was weak for free and discounted goods.</p>\n<p>“Your EXP bar didn’t even budge a little,” Monkey muttered with a meek voice.</p>\n<p>“The liquid is surprisingly well made though. Is this really made by someone you know?”</p>\n<p>“I said before, Young Master. The one who made this hailed from an old Alchemist family that even outside South Tiramikal Kingdom their last name still can be a pretty big deal. I’m pretty confident that--normally--this elixir will have a 100% success rate for leveling up whoever drinks it!”</p>\n<p>“Such a confident boast. Are you perhaps implying that my case is not <em>normally</em>?”</p>\n<p>“He hehe, you surely joke. You know that I don’t mean any harm, young master.”</p>\n<p>Shira of course knew it. And the other thing he also knew, that if it was a really impressive elixir he just drank by now, the usual Monkey wouldn’t utter a single phrase of the word “free”, regardless how many times the elixir failed to deliver its promise.</p>\n<p>Shira looked at Monkey suspiciously, “You’re Monkey, aren’t you? Not someone brainwashed by my family’s enemy or something like that? You know, by vampires.”</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira… now your joke is not even funny--something like a poor peddler to be brainwashed only appears in stories. Vampires are some unfounded folklore.”</p>\n<p>“Monkey I know is stupid. If not brainwashed, then he definitely manipulated to sell a fake elixir to someone from big families.”</p>\n<p>Before Monkey was able to retort that, a cold voice came from the wagon. “Young Master Yashura, I don’t mind if you pinpoint Monkey’s stupidity and make assumptions about him muchever you want. But to call my elixir is fake, I can’t stand and watch around anymore.”</p>\n<p>A man appeared from the wagon Monkey had, had an appearance of the stereotypical scholar Shira had in mind--though, by the way he crossed his arms pompously, he seemed to have a pride worthy of someone hailed from big families.</p>\n<p>“You’re the Alchemist?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, you call me Snake--don’t ask for my real name,” the Alchemist said.</p>\n<p>One would hide his name if he didn’t want to be associated with his family anymore. So Shira didn’t ask. He looked at the scholarly Alchemist, then at the peddler. One was the Snake and the other one was the Monkey.</p>\n<p>Shira found some sort of strange camradice between them. “I see, so both of you decided to be a partner for life.”</p>\n<p>“Not for life, no. Spare me. It’s better for me to ditch this stupid ape as soon as he outlives his usefulness.”</p>\n<p>“Heey! Don’t say ditching in front of me!” Monkey protested. Snake ignored him without pretense, making the impression that this scene was ordinary for them.</p>\n<p>Shira then asked Snake straightforwardly.</p>\n<p>“What kind of elixir is this?”</p>\n<p>“Didn’t Monkey tell you? A Boost Elixir. My latest masterpiece,” Snake replied.</p>\n<p>“You’re aware that your partner tried to sell your masterpiece at a half price, right? I don’t even have to pay, it was what he said before.”</p>\n<p>“It was my idea,” Snake said. “This is a simple business hack. I’m confident about my concoctions. After all, I experimented heavily on human anatomy--too heavy, even, to the point folks in my family want me gone for good. I’ve got nothing to lose here. That bottle is a prototype; it cost a lot so I planned to price it a lot.”</p>\n<p>“You want to use my bad reputation as a stepping stone, don’t you?” Shira asked with a sour smile.</p>\n<p>“Yes. Do you mind?”</p>\n<p>“No, I’d gladly make profit out of those trash talking they did behind my back--though, it seems you picked the wrong guinea pig to be your mascot for your ‘business hack’,” Shira said with a wry smile.</p>\n<p>Monkey nodded weakly. As a peddler from outside the village, he was always bothered by how nasty rumors could be, especially with some acquaintance he depended on sometimes as an important business partner.</p>\n<p>Seeing that they no longer had things to chat about, Shira said to them he’d consider putting some resources if he managed to gain some nod from the family elders after he went through the coming-of-age ceremony next year. And now that he finished selling Good-Natured Spirit’s rejected commision and completed the errand his aunt gave him, Shira then bid farewell to the two animal-nicknamed gentlemen.</p>\n<p>“Please wait, Young Master Shira.”</p>\n<p>Shira turned back his head again and found Snake, the one who called him, ran back to Monkey’s wagon to grab something.</p>\n<p>“Try to drink this one,” Snake said after trotting back hurriedly. “It’s alright, you don’t have to pay for this time too.”</p>\n<p>The current elixir Snake took out was the exact opposite from the previous one. Its container was beautiful and high-class, but the content was muddy and very low in quality. Hearing that this one was also free, Shira didn’t hesitate to drink it.</p>\n<p>The after taste was incredibly sour. Unlike any other bitter concocted elixirs or potions he ever drank. Although not much, Shira could feel his body warming up. He was surprised at the unexpected reaction.</p>\n<p>“Oohhhh!!!” Monkey cried as his eyes glued at Shira’s Status Window. “The EXP bar moved!”</p>\n<p>“What?” the surprised Shira glanced at Snake and asked slowly, “This one’s free, right?”</p>\n<p>It was in a single flash Shira did catch a strange dumbfoundedness in Snake eyes, like the result even came more shocking than him than either of Shira and Monkey. Yet the moment after he promptly regained his stoic exposure, then said to Shira, “Don’t worry, I don’t plan to take back my words,”</p>\n<p>The odd Alchemist put his hands at his back and walked back to his wagon. Before he climbed the wagon, he once again glanced at Shira, looking in a state of half-disbelief like expression</p>\n<p>As Snake disappeared into the wagon, Shira and Monkey exchanged glances.</p>\n<p>“He still has that kind of face even though he promises it to be free? You sure do have an odd friend.” Shira said.</p>\n<p>Monkey grinned. “Though an oddball, I never seen anyone with more talent in alchemy than him, like, ever.”</p>\n<p>After leaving Monkey to continue his stall, Shira saw Good-Natured Spirit again when he visited a food stall not far from Monkey’s wagon. He asked what he was doing, and the Nalaq told him there was a fool who bet a lot and won a lot in the gambling games. To lose against in gambling against someone with Good-Natured Spirit’s caliber, really--Shira sighed--he couldn’t wait for his coming-of-age ceremony next year so he too could farm on these gullible people in some friendly matches--just like what he did with Good-Natured Spirit for this past one year.</p>\n<p>“You know,” munching on some satays he bought from the market, Shira muttered when he headed home along with Good-Natured Spirit, “just then I drank this elixir that really could boost my EXP a little. I don’t know how the guy concocts it, but I have the feeling that I just drink some very expensive elixir for free.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, yeah?”</p>\n<p>On the way back to Yashura Family Shira told the Nalaq spirit about the Alchemist and his elixirs. He also told him that his status that usually wouldn’t react to normal elixirs this time moved a bit after he drank a strange low-quality elixir.</p>\n<p>“That Alchemist must be a nerd to be that sharp,” Good-Natured Spirit said as he floated lazily beside the boy.</p>\n<p>“He looks like that too. The peddler he partnered with also has some good sense in him. So I thought it’s not a loss for me to use all those foreign coins I got from you to invest on them for the next year.”</p>\n<p>“Hmm,” Good-Natured Spirit crossed his arms. “I think you should be worried.”</p>\n<p>“Worried? Why?”</p>\n<p>“You said that nerd Alchemist was the one who pushed that low-quality elixir to you, right?”</p>\n<p>“I got to drink that for free,” Shira emphasized.</p>\n<p>“He realized one little secret about you then,” Good-Natured Spirit said.</p>\n<p>Shira stopped walking. He looked at him with his head tilted.</p>\n<p>“What secret?”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit who floated before, spoke again.</p>\n<p>“You shouldn’t worry about it too much for now, brat. But, I advise you, if you are still holding dear for your lazy, peaceful village life, you should turn back and kill him right now.”</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-2/chapter-3-5":"<p>What the Nalaq told Shira lingered in his mind. Good-Natured Spirit blurted something about killing someone as if it was something trivial that could popped out easily in normal conversation. To kill someone after finding out his secret--what kind of secret he needed to protect anyway? A secret he never wanted people to know the fact he was drawing semi-porns for money. But he wasn’t that insecure to kill someone over a petty secret like that? That would be him being not right in the head. The more he thought about Good-Natured Spirit’s remark, the more it disturbed him. Especially right now, when his hands painted in red, bathed in blood. When he just did an act of actual killing.</p>\n<p>“Something on your mind, Young Master Shira?” a rough voice disturbed his train of thought.</p>\n<p>“Ah,” Shira looked at a burly man, an experienced hunter, who called him.</p>\n<p>The man’s body even drenched in thicker blood than him. One would get easily nauseated by the sight of it. Yet it didn’t make the boy flinched, as he was expecting the experience for a few months already.</p>\n<p>“Here. Look at his gut. Spilling out his innards with your own hands might be a good experience for you, young master.”</p>\n<p>The hunter spun a sharp dagger, holding it by the tip of its blade, having a gesture of offering it to his young master.</p>\n<p>“Is that okay? I even had trouble when skinning the hide,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>He’d rather not, to be honest, since splitting a goat’s gut could be messy if he did it crudely. Even if he was the young master of the family, when messing with the raw meat, not even his uncle could save him from the aunties’ nagging. Shira Yashura was nearly sixteen, almost reaching adulthood, so he had to participate in butchering goats; it was a quite tasking task, but was easy enough compared to butchering cows he had to do in a few years. But for the fifteen years old young master, getting the hang of the butchering knife’s handle was plenty of experience already for him.</p>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>As the custom dictates, every month in ngajen ceremony preparation, the boys will have to deal with cows and goats while the girls help aunties plucking chickens’ and ducks’ feathers. Whether the gatekeepers' children or the family’s next heirs, all of them are required to do it every time a major ceremony approaches.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>After doing his part in butchering a goat Shira immediately took a bath to remove the bloody pungent. On a whim he then strolled to the kitchen to grab some snacks. There he witnessed how all the coconuts he and his uncle shred already transformed into delicious foods; rendang, Bulayak satay, coconut satay, spicy curry, many other mouth drolling coconut cuisines. The coconut loving uncle was all smiles and gave him a big portion of the famous beef cuisine the locals called rendang--which, normally, even for a young master like Shira would get to eat rendang once every few months. But with enough wit and experience in currying favor with his uncle, he got to taste those delicious food handed down by his uncle, the Chief Chef, personally.</p>\n<p>“Shira my boy,” Patriarch Shuro said to his nephew who was squatting below the shadow of a thick pillar, happily munching on his rendang, “you’re going to visit Malikh Family tonight. Keep a good check on your cousin. Don’t embarrass Yashura Family and present our rendang_ _for their main family.”</p>\n<p>“Sure.”</p>\n<hr>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>Domesticated cows were less in numbers than goats in Badril Village, so meals from cows, not including the innards which could be made into popular but cheap cuisines, like only served for village big shots or important visitors during the ngajen ceremony.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>Laughters and chatters made the night more merry than any other thay of the month. It was brighter than usual, as villagers came out of their house to set up big braziers to light the road between the families that were holding festives. From one hundred meters away, through the thick wall of the big families, the mouth-watering aroma of prepared food wafted through the air as if they informally invited people to come and to taste the delicacy these big families had. The change in scenery upon the arrival of the night signaled the nigh of Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>Yashura Family, the oldest family around, was known to have the best food amongst all families in Badril Village, while Elzhier Family known as the family that always threw the biggest party post-ceremony--Elzhier Family’s maidservants were beautiful and they’d show off their voluptuous bodies every single ngajen ceremony. Particularly this month however, everyone was anticipating the ceremony thrown by Malikh Family; for two years since the young lady’s absence they threw nothing more than mediocre festivities, her return was to be seen as their revival on the village’s political stage. And from how big their arrangement looked like, it seemed Malikh Family didn’t plan to fail everyone’s expectations.</p>\n<p>Shira Yashura wore the same suit he got from his uncle on his fifteenth birthday. It was the usual suit he’d wear whenever a ceremony was held. His uncle bought it from a merchant who had connections outside the kingdom, which was pretty good since the fabric wasn’t stiff, but could get unbearably itchy in places he didn’t want to scratch whenever there were people around. The obvious part missing from the wears his peers were wearing was beast pelts.</p>\n<p>Pelts from ferocious beasts were known for irrefutable proof for boys’ courage and manliness. As many young gentlemen of Badril Village wore on their necks, always looking for the opportunity to show off the trophy of their preys to girls--which translated as fashionable fads for boys who wanted to get laids.</p>\n<p>Of course, Shira, as part of the dull and no-nonsense camp of the boys in Badril Village, never had participated in that kind of indecent business. He was so dull that the only girl who would accompany him to attend ceremonies was his cousin Mila--who, even though her face was quite pretty, also happened to be in terrible luck for romance.</p>\n<p>“No matter how many times I see it, it’s always impressive to see how fast you wrap all these banana leaves,” Shira commented as he watched how Mila wrapped rendang with banana leaves. She was very good at it, comparable to the aunties’ skills that had been forged day and night in the family’s kitchen.</p>\n<p>“You talking? You’ve done your training with the family's sword technique, I assume?” Mila said with her lips pouted. Shira thought it was unusual for Mila didn’t nag her mouth off immediately when she saw him. He saw a sword wrapped in cloth near Mila. His face immediately twisted in a troubled look.</p>\n<p>“I won’t bring that thing,” he protested.</p>\n<p>“You--” Mila hissed.</p>\n<p>“What should I do with a sword inside another family’s ceremony?” Shira said. The sword was his father’s, and that was his reason he didn’t want to use it. “Look, I can only draw the blade from the sheath at most. Without a proper amount of Strength attribute I can’t swing this properly. It rejects my mana. I’d make a fool out of myself if that happened.”</p>\n<p>“That’s because you were stupidly increasing your Wisdom instead of, that’s why you--arghh! Just forget about it! I know you’re trying to make excuses! Since you’re so weak all we can do is flaunting around your father’s reputation. We’ve got to remind people that our Yashura Family’s not to mess with. Here, just slip this fucking sword in your belt.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, this is embarrassing. Those rumors are about to get worse tonight,” Shira said with a sigh. His reputation as a trash talent was annoying enough, added this shameless act of throwing his weight around, he’d become more reluctant to show his face in the public later on. But still he unwillingly slipped the sword in his belt.</p>\n<p>Mila snorted. She ignored the complaint. Right now she could care less about the rumors about her cousin. What she had to prioritize tonight was the bad premonition she had about Bhela Malikh’s short hair--nobody believed her when she said that Bhela was being a slut for cutting her hair short in spite of her being in an engagement. While her hands craftly knotted the rendang wrapped in banana leaves with a rope made with dried coconut leaves, she suddenly had a cold smile; the image of those impudent Malikhs shuddering under the famous sword of Yashura Family’s Unique Class, Jhuro Yashura the Blackfang Swordsman, entertained her she began to chuckle coldly.</p>\n<p>“Huhuhu… just you wait you bitch…”</p>\n<p>Shira stepped back. He had the hunch he should keep a distance away from his current cousin right now.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Every month, for every family in Badril Village, cooking during the Ngajen Ceremony was always a time rushing hectic. Even more in Malikh Family this time. Since the amount of food they had to deliver before the ceremony started more than twice the amount they made last month, most of the aunties in duty were cooking outdoors. The smoke from the half-dried firewood would be too unbearable for the eyes if all of them cooked in one cramped place. Fortunately, most of the dishes were already cooked and sent to the courtyard, so the only people who were still on duty preparing food were a small number of aunties and maidservants.</p>\n<p>The young maidservants were pale from tiredness but they couldn’t afford to slack in this one Ngajen Ceremony. The usual noisy aunties, they didn’t even show a sign of wanting to rest. Nobody could beat the resilience of the kitchen-duty armies when it came to preparing for a loadful of party’s foods.</p>\n<p>Usually, the one who would supervise these spartan cooking aunties would be the patriarch’s wife, Bhela’s mother. It was already a long-held tradition in the village for the patriarch to cook for the family’s important guests as the Chief Chef, while the wife supported him by supervising the aunties and maidservants. In Ngajen Ceremony this month, however, Bhela’s mother holed herself to accompany the husband on his ill-bed.</p>\n<p>She was not in the mood to meet with people. So Bhela stepped in to fill her position.</p>\n<p>Back when she was little Bhela often followed her mother working during the ngajen ceremony, she knew what she had to do by the back of her hand. In usage of salt, for example, she knew down to the tiniest detail of how much salt should be applied to different kinds of cuisines. She also instructed the inexperienced maidservants who were in charge of cooking side dishes so the overall quality of the feast would be balanced. Bhela Malikh didn’t betray everyone’s expectations about her. She did her work splendidly.</p>\n<p>However, there was a matter she saw that didn’t make her happy. The largest furnace that was usually reserved for the Chief Chef, today was used by an old man from the outer family. A great cook, the old man was. Known for his vast experience in handling the family’s food stalls for years. The problem was his common status. Without at least an elder status made it awkward for him to cook as the Chief Chef in this kitchen, even if he was a mere proxy. Bhela wondered whether the one who took the charge when her parents were unavailable knew the risk of being laughed at and criticized by the other two big families--especially now that the relationship between Yashura and Malikh wasn’t that good like before.</p>\n<p>“Young lady, the day’s getting dark, you should take a bath now and prepare yourself for the ceremony,” an aunty said to Bhela.</p>\n<p>“Yes, young lady is no longer a little girl, so making you pretty will take a while,” an early twenty maidservant added from the side. She continued, “The new girls should be able to complete the foods since you directed them a lot. Please don’t worry about us.”</p>\n<p>“I’m relieved to hear that,” Bhela said. Not yet three seconds later her eyes wandered to the old cook again. She couldn’t hide her frown.</p>\n<p>“Something the matter, Young Lady Bhela?”</p>\n<p>“Yes. Maybe it’s a misunderstanding on my part but… I can’t see the elder who would substitute my father as the Chief Chef.”</p>\n<p>Hearing Bhela said her concern, the aunties and the maidservants averted eyes with their young lady with troubled faces. Bhela then understood there was something shady going on.</p>\n<p>Her suspicion turned worse when she saw a young man in his twenties leading four manservants with him. When the aunties were working in the kitchen, it was an unspoken rule for unrelated adult men not to approach, but the battle-hardened aunties that normally were ferocious in defending their territories were all silent in welcoming the cocky visitors. It wasn’t surprising to Bhela that all of them came from Elder Jhamil’s faction.</p>\n<p>“Why aren’t you ready yet, old worm?!”</p>\n<p>“I am sorry, young elder… some dish cannot be rushed so I prepared some to--”</p>\n<p><em>Slap!!</em></p>\n<p>The slapping sound echoed in the kitchen. The room descended into a dead silent. The old cook was trembling; he lowered his head and covered the cheek that just got slapped but everyone could see the blood on the corner of his mouth. Bhela recollected her memory, and finally remembered the arrogant young man was actually Elder Jhamil’s own son.</p>\n<p>“Shit!” Elder Jhamil’s son swore, “those councils from Village Hall came. We must complete the set before too long! Those people are the ones who usually have the heaviest voice when valuing Ngajen Ceremony dishes!”</p>\n<p>One follower quipped, “Young elder is right. This old worm can’t cook shit! If this goes on, the only things the Village Hall council will remember about Elder Jhamil’s cooking is that we Malikhs cook as slow as snail!”</p>\n<p>The frown on Bhela’s face became deeper. Young elder? Before she went out for the seminars that lasted two years, this man, son of Elder Jhamil, merely a family member with a post within the family’s business. And something else that disturbed her was how she couldn’t see how the blurted about Elder Jhamil’s cooking, the one who worked in the kitchen all day, didn’t see the said elder even once today.</p>\n<p>Bhela still held her silent. But her eyes were cold and sharp judging people and the situation. The aunties and the maidservants, though they looked sympathetic with the old man, were afraid to go against Elder Jhamil’s son. Maybe because the lack of resistance Elder Jhamil’s son dared to do a taboo known in the kitchen--swapping food that wrapped in banana leaves with ceramic plates, garnished a bit, and called it the Chief Chef’s cuisine.</p>\n<p>“No, young elder!” a brave middle-aged aunty stepped forward, “you can’t do that!”</p>\n<p>“Why not?” one follower sneered in Elder Jhamil’s son’s place. “This one also got beef, isn’t it? We need to quickly serve the Chief Chef cuisine to the people from Village Hall councils.”</p>\n<p>“Exactly because they are from the Village Hall council--just from inferior cuts of the beef they’d know the dishes have been swapped! You’ll tarnish Malikh Family’s honor if people knew you were fooling--”</p>\n<p>“Fooling?!” Elder Jhamil roared.</p>\n<p>The young elder raised his hand, though the aunty who complained quickly hid back behind the maidservants. Elder Jhamil’s son then rampaged into a series of barking, yelling and threatening the aunties to cut their salary just because his mood was spoiled.</p>\n<p>His words scared all the girls and the women inside the kitchen. All except Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>After they were done swapping the foods, the young elder led his men out of the kitchen with great swagger. The young elder stopped at the door, turned around, and gave the old cook one last ultimatum: “There’ll be a noble in the ceremony so we need rendang for the main course. So go make it, old worm. You know what’s gonna happen if you couldn’t deliver, don’t you?”</p>\n<p>The old man trembled. Even the eyes on the aunties couldn’t help but shake at the threat. There was now way they could prepare rendang with only two hours remaining until the Ngajen Ceremony started.</p>\n<p>After that situation calmed down. The aunties and the maidservants went back to work. Some of them still exchanged whispered and gossiped amongst themselves. But when Bhela approached, immediately they stopped and pretended nothing happened.</p>\n<p>“Young lady…” a pudgy aunty came to her, the one who stood up against the young elder from before.</p>\n<p>“Aunty?”</p>\n<p>“We are sorry… we’ve had no meaning to show you that embarrassing scene.”</p>\n<p>Bhela shook her head. “No, I’m one from the main family bloodline; I should've been the one who stood up to him instead of hiding behind everyone.”</p>\n<p>The aunty knew the young lady didn’t say a word before because the girl wanted to know the situation. Some other middle-aged aunties who were close with Madam Malikh also knew more or less Bhela’s detached wait-and-see attitude, so no one really would blame her even if she didn’t say a word before--especially since she had just returned from overseas. The pudgy aunty tugged on Bhela’s sleeve, whispered to her ear, “Young Lady Bhela, we know you’re concerned. But we’ve already gotten used to it. You’re still young. Your future is brighter than everyone else in the family, Young Lady Bhela. It’s better to endure than pointlessly making enemies.”</p>\n<p>“This isn’t pointless,” Bhela said. She then grabbed the nearest apron and wore it. Her father was the patriarch. And she wasn’t a poster girl to draw everyone’s attention to the family.</p>\n<p>The pudgy aunty wanted to say something again. But words stuck on her throat, she closed her mouth as soon as she opened it.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the old man began to pick some mature coconut and shredded it listlessly. He got more than four decades of handling food stalls for Malikh Family, he wasn’t a stranger at cooking rendang. But he already gave up on finishing one for tonight’s Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>“Uncle, I’ll take it from here,” Bhela said as she approached the weary old man.</p>\n<p>“Ahh, yes?” the old man was started. The girl came with an apron and common garment, had fair and beautiful skin, as well clear and articulate voice; a maidservant from the inner family was the first one that came to his mind. But only when he noticed even the aunties were respectful to her and her striking bob-cut short hair that the old man began drenched in cold sweat.</p>\n<p>“I said, uncle,” Bhela repeated, “I’ll take it from here. You can rest now.”</p>\n<p>The old man vigorously shook his head.</p>\n<p>“Please Young Lady Bhela… please spare this old bone….”</p>\n<p>“This is originally my father’s post, uncle. You’ll have to be at least an elder and write your name in council’s ledger to be a substitute for my father.”</p>\n<p>The old man wanted to break into a tearless cry. This is worse than when he faced Elder Jhamil’s son's harassment before. The most thing he was afraid of was the news of Elder Jhamil using him as Chief Chef behind the scene to reach the ears of the main family. And now that Bhela Malikh was here, there was nothing he could do but to resign his life to fate.</p>\n<p>“Y-young lady!” a maidservant yelled, “you can’t!”</p>\n<p>“Who says I can’t?” Bhela asked sharply.</p>\n<p>An aunty, who had a stern-looking face, said, “You can’t cook for the main course, young lady. In case of a patriarch's absence, usually one of the elders who’s going to take his place. There’s no rule saying it’s okay for women to do it.”</p>\n<p>“Then, I’m going to ask,” from the aunty, Bhela threw her glance toward the old man, “are you an elder cooking here to substitute my father as a cook, uncle?”</p>\n<p>The old man’s face turned pale. Whichever the answer of that question would lead him to the road of punishment. All of the sudden, he became a mute.</p>\n<p>Because she had the most standing, nobody made a sound when Young Lady Bhela Malikh asked them to fetch chickens and spices for her.</p>\n<p>Not long after, the story about how the Young Lady of Malikh Family wanted to substitute her father spread like a wildfire. Never in Badril Village’s history would a young lady do that. A crowd of curious males, mostly the youngsters from main and outer of Malikh Family, surrounded the kitchen as they wanted to catch a glimpse of how their beautiful young lady recklessly challenged the custom by her own. The boys sighed in admiration. Bhela Malikh was essentially an Archer at heart. But the way she handled a blade, even if it was a kitchen knife, was skillful and graceful, as every time her slim wrist stopped moving from cutting down a vegetable, a wave of gulping could be heard. The boys couldn’t take their eyes from her. The reckless and brave young lady was simply too charming.</p>\n<p>“Did you know that foreigners often confuse rendang as dried curry?” Bhela said to one maidservant who stared at the way she cooked. “Curry leaves originated from an area close to western Haldeen lands, so many local Mossacks sailed the sea to try their luck making it big working for western empires.”</p>\n<p>The usual aloof Bhela unusually was talkative when she was cooking, which was quite a big surprise for people who were watching. She explained to the clueless maidservants how, during her two years travelling in seminars from countries to countries, found many noble owned restaurants claimed to serve rendang but turned out to be dried curry. All the while sharply focused on doing her cooking duty.</p>\n<p>“Young lady!” from the crowd came out an angry bald man. He was Elder Jhamil. “W-what are you doing there?”</p>\n<p>“I’m cooking,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“But you can’t work there!” Elder Jhamil yelled. “No woman can substitute for patriarch! That’s against the rule!”</p>\n<p>“I don’t recall we have a rule like that.”</p>\n<p>“If you know why you still stand there?”</p>\n<p>“Neither do I recall a rule for an elder to use a stand-in for the Chief Chef position.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s face turned weird as if he suddenly got constipated. Many of the youngsters didn’t catch Bhela’s remarks nor they cared too much about it, but some in the crowd were nodding knowingly, as many of them were familiar with how shady Elder Jhamil was doing things.</p>\n<p>As the bald elder’s head was racing fast looking for an answer to defuse the young lady’s claim, suddenly, a loud roar exploded behind him.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela, who do you think you are? Just because your father is the family’s patriarch you think you can do whatever you want?!”</p>\n<p>The faces of aunties and the maidservants twitched. They witnessed how the young elder harassed the old man before, so they were itching to throw back the same question at him instead, though no more brave aunties dared to cause more troubles.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s son continued, “The ingredient for making Chief dishes takes money, young lady. Not even the patriarch himself has the daring to use coins from the treasury for himself. Do you want to embarrass your parents that much?”</p>\n<p>“I’m not making this food for myself nor I cook for my father. It’s for the guests. And I provided the spices and the foreign curry leaves by myself,” Bhela said. Some maidservants behind her nodded nervously as Bhela indeed ordered them to fetch spices from the personal kitchen in the main family’s residential area.</p>\n<p>In spite of that, the young elder kept pushing on with nasty smile on his face.</p>\n<p>“What about the chicken, young lady? They cost money! What do you say about that, huh?”</p>\n<p>Behind Bhela, the aunties, even the maidservants, were whispering at each other on how ridiculous it was to question the sole young generation of Malikh Family main bloodline over some chickens. Even Bhela, the young lady in question, would only glanced at the troubled expression of Elder Jhamil.</p>\n<p>“I will pay for the chicken,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Ha? Pay? With what? Your father’s money? Can’t a sick person even pay the cost of the foods for ngajen ceremony all by himself?”</p>\n<p>“No need to bring my father’s name here.” Bhela said with a dangerously cold tone.</p>\n<p>The chillness in her eyes was telling that she really did hate people bringing her parents’ name in bad faith. After hearing gasps of surprise from people that didn’t expect the usually silent young lady could utter something with such a biting tone, she sighed, said with an explanation, “I got a dress as a gift from a certain person who has too much money in his pocket. He said the dress is so valuable even the princesses wear them in parties. It should cover the cost of these chickens I’m going to cook if I sell the dress right here right now.”</p>\n<p>Bhela then tilted her head and glanced at the bald elder.</p>\n<p>“Am I right, Elder Jhamil?”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil wanted to maintain his smile, but his face went stiff as stone. He was trembling inside for knowing that the dress he acquired with a large sum of money and with his best connection, valued the same as some mere village chickens in Bhela’s eyes.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, his son, who was taken aback for a bit from the cold remark Bhela had said earlier, recovered, began to yell again, “Ha! Did you not train your brain when you were overseas, my young lady? The same dress princesses wear in parties? Only someone dumb believe that! Hah! Obviously you’ve been lied to! You’ve been crooked, young lady, crooked--”</p>\n<p><em>Paak!</em></p>\n<p>From behind, the already red-faced Elder Jhamil smacked his son’s head. “You’ve been rude to Young Lady Bhela, you dumbskull! You have to apologize! Young lady can’t bear to hear it anymore!”</p>\n<p>While in fact it was him who couldn’t bear to hear being called a crook.</p>\n<p>“Apologize!” Elder Jhamil roared.</p>\n<p><em>Splash!</em></p>\n<p>The pair father and son’s performance didn’t amuse Bhela, however. With the lid in her hand, Bhela scooped boiling curry broth and splashed it to their direction. Surprised, the stupid young elder swore with nasty words while his father cried in high-pitched voice.</p>\n<p>“Please get out,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil laughed wryly.</p>\n<p>“Please don’t be like that, young lady. I know my son doesn't have the best education but--”</p>\n<p><em>Splash!!</em></p>\n<p>Bhela waved the cooking lid once again as soon as Elder Jhamil stepped forward. The hot water splashed on his expensive boots. This time, while he didn’t expect for Bhela splashing hot water at him again, he wasn’t freaking out. It seemed his plan to make the young lady behave a little backfiring instead. His face turned solemn.</p>\n<p>“Young lady…”</p>\n<p>“I’m not going to say it thrice--everyone who has nothing to do in the kitchen, please get out,” Bhela said. “Or else--”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The major families’ lands were astonishingly spacious and complex, their walls were thick and tall, therefore each of them employed a few stationary guards for the main gate as gatekeepers. These gatekeepers, though usually filled by members of the outer part of the families, their duty were significantly more important than others since they represented the face of the family they served. So they always maintain polite gestures to everyone who came through their gate, either commoners or rich people from big families. Yet when Shira and Mila arrived the Malikh Family’s gatekeepers didn’t even hide their scoffs.</p>\n<p>“Ridiculous!” she hissed with a face boiled in anger, “even lowly gatekeepers are looking down on us!”</p>\n<p>“Don’t bother with them,” Shira said. Unlike his cousin’s furious temper, his flair seemed like he shrugged the blatant disrespect, as the holder of “Eternal Novice” title he was already numb by how people were talking behind his back.</p>\n<p>“If your father was here they’d bow their asses as soon as they saw us Yashura coming.”</p>\n<p>Shira shrugged his shoulders again.</p>\n<p>Still seething in anger, Mila cast her eyes on the banana leaves wrapped food in Shira’s hands. “Who should we give the rendang to?” she asked.</p>\n<p>“Let’s just give it to a random servant.” Then Shira called a maidservant who was carrying a tray full of food. “Excuse me!”</p>\n<p>“Yes? What can I help y--” The moment this maidservant turned her head and saw Shira’s face, she immediately threw back her eyes and escaped with hurried trot, pretending she saw nothing.</p>\n<p>“The fuck?!” Mila was flastergabbed, didn’t know what to say.</p>\n<p>Later on Shira and Mila realized how unpopular Yashura Family was to the current Malikhs, even the servants who usually held no voice in the family were avoiding the pair of cousins like plague. Their attitude especially worsened when it came to Shira Yashura.</p>\n<p>“Look there,” someone whispered amongst the guests, “Yashura Family send their eldest young miss and the young master! Out of all the Ngajen Ceremony, they choose tonight to show their faces--pretty obvious, eh? Bet they’re drooling to get another Unique Class after knowing our Young Lady Bhela’s real talent tonight!”</p>\n<p>Someone else agreed and replied, “With that kind of trash as their young master, they’d be dreamin’ to get even a touch of our Young Lady Bhela. Pueh!”</p>\n<p>Hearing the muffled disdain, Mila Yashura whirled her body, glaring people with eagle eyes. “Who said that?!” she growled.</p>\n<p>“Mila…” Shira held her shoulder.</p>\n<p>“The fuckers don’t even put our Yashura Family in their eyes. Just because shitty rumors about Unique Class they started to feel high and mighty, eh?”</p>\n<p>“Just let go, Uncle Shuro didn’t send us here to start troubles,” Shira said. “All we need to do is to show our faces here and give them our rendang. It’s not our problem whether they welcome our good intention with grace or not.”</p>\n<p>Though Shira said that, he secretly hoped Malikh Family would grow too proud to receive it--all so he had an excuse to keep his uncle’s rendang for himself.</p>\n<p>A commotion arose. People hussing here and there with excitement. When Shira and Mila wanted to know what was going on, a parade of beautiful young women glittering and stealing the whole show came from inside of Malikh Family’s hall. Leading them was a short-haired young beauty, face as icy as an ice sculpture, the recent name that everyone had been talking about these days, Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>It was clear from the way Bhela positioned herself she represented the family as the ceremony’s Chief Chef.</p>\n<p>“Whoa, so Malikh Family let her do that,” Shira murmured.</p>\n<p>Not to mention being the Chief Chef--the most Shira did in his family’s kitchen was helping his uncle, helping him shred coconuts. They were at the same age, but the same old Shira still practiced butchering goats while the supposed fiancée of his was climbing the social ladder. Even Mila was angry by the special treatment Malikh Family gave to their young lady.</p>\n<p>“Sup, young master!” from behind a voice called him.</p>\n<p>Shira turned around, found the one who greeted him was Monkey.</p>\n<p>“Who?” Mila asked Shira as the stranger with a monkey-like face approaching.</p>\n<p>“This one is called by the name of Monkey, young lady,” Monkey, with his self-trained Mossack’s style bowing gesture, introduced himself smoothly.</p>\n<p>Mila hummed in ackwnoledgement. It was harder to forget than remembering someone with such combination of face and awkward name.</p>\n<p>“Mister Monkey, I thought you’ll spend the ceremony to show Mister Snake around since he’s an outsider. What are you doing in Malikh Family?” Shira asked.</p>\n<p>“Now, now, please drop the ‘Mister’, young master. I’m not that old yet to be called as such,” Monkey said, then he continued explaining his story this evening. “We were planning to go to your family’s ceremony, young master. But who would have thought Snake to meet with his relatives here? His relatives are actually Malikh Family’s guests for tonight’s Ngajen Ceremony. Bet he got to eat expensive cuisines right now.”</p>\n<p>“Well, it’ll be easier with Mister Snake here. I’ve got some coins I want to show you, I wonder if it works to use them for--” Shira sneakily glanced at his cousin, then turned back to Monkey like it was nothing, “--for the thing we talked about yesterday.”</p>\n<p>Mila sneered, “You have some business to attend, no?”</p>\n<p>“Not really, no,” Shira shrugged off her question.</p>\n<p>“Really, though?” Mila crossed her arms, sneered again. “I think I saw Romana just now. I’mma chat with her a little bit.”</p>\n<p>It seemed to Shira that his cousin meeting with Romana here, in Malikh Family’s Ngajen Ceremony, wasn’t simply to have fun. He didn’t like his cousin would make trouble but he didn’t want to spend the whole night with her either. “Don’t go home without me,” he said eventually.</p>\n<p>“Hmph! You’re not a kid anymore but still need me to accompany you home?”</p>\n<p>No, Shira actually was more worried about her than himself.</p>\n<p>He then glanced beside and said, “Mister Monkey.”</p>\n<p>“Just Monkey,” Monkey corrected.</p>\n<p>“Mister Just Monkey, you said Mister Snake with relative? And his relatives are Malikh Family’s guests?”</p>\n<p>“Not Just Mon--ah, forget about it,” Monkey already gave up guessing whether Young Master Shira Yashura was purposely pulling his leg or not. “They really were Malikh Family’s guests, they even got the front row for the prayer and all.”</p>\n<p>“Is hard for us to be friendly if Mister Snake is involved with Malikh Family.”</p>\n<p>“You mean, that, huh? Well, I’ve been here for a while and they talked about you a lot, so I guess even someone as chill as you can get angry sometimes. But you don’t have to worry about those Malikhs, Young Master Shira. As long as their patriarch is Ghalim Malikh they won’t sever ties with Yashura so easily.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, is this your opinion?”</p>\n<p>“It’s Snake’s. It’s what he said before he met his relatives.”</p>\n<p>Shira thought the Alchemist he met once before was a total stranger of Badril Village, but it appeared he was wrong. “He really does know about Malikh Family that much, doesn’t he?”</p>\n<p>“Well, yeah, but I think he’s more familiar with Yashura than Malikh Family, though,” Monkey said, crossing his arms and nodded to himself as he recalled things that Snake told him to get his wares supported by Yashura Family; for example, obtaining Butler Yulong’s permission the same as Patriarch Shuro Yashura’s, Snake once said.</p>\n<p>“What? Why do you make that kind of face, Young Master Shira?” Monkey was snapped from his train of thought.</p>\n<p>“Ah, no, I just don’t expect you’re going to say some like that.”</p>\n<p>“What are you saying, young master. In the first place, Snake became my crew because he heard I’ve some dealing with Yashura Family.”</p>\n<p>Shira did recall the first time Monkey contacted Yashura Family--through him. To be more exact, the first item Monkey dealt from Malikh Family was Shira’s smuggled erotic painting that Good-Natured Spirit rejected.</p>\n<p>“--Speaking of Snake,” with his thumb Monkey did point in a certain direction. The place was separated from the common guest as they indeed were Malikh Family’s special guests. Shira’s eyes followed and he saw the familiar Alchemist he knew not long ago, Snake, was talking with two men, young and old, most likely brother and his grandfather.</p>\n<p>“Don’t be fooled by their appearances, young master. They’re renowned experts,” Monkey said.</p>\n<p>The pair of brother and grandfather wore worn out pale robes as their clothes, unlike the image of revered experts in Shira’s mind. Monkey told him both likely to travel incognito for various reasons. The old man had an old white hair and long beard, his back crooked and had to bring a walking staff to support himself, and gave people the impression of a sleepy grandpa from the dim light on his eyes. The young one though, had an always angry-looking face with fierce brows, crossing his muscle-thick arms, locked in a debate with Snake. Snake’s face was notably paler than when Shira met him in the market.</p>\n<p>“We can’t greet Mister Snake now, can we?” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think we can,” Monkey said. Even though he long considered Snake as his partner, the two guests appearing incognito were still the main members of the revered Alchemist family. This was no time for commoners like him acting friendly on them all of the sudden.</p>\n<p>The sleepy-looking old man, noticing two pairs of eyes looking at him, he raised his head. He caught the sight of Shira. Their eyes met.</p>\n<p>“Oh ho,” the old man smiled when he found the boy. He dragged his old body to approach the flastergabbed Shira and Monkey.</p>\n<p>Even Monkey who knew more about them wouldn’t expect Snake’s relatives to introduce themselves first.</p>\n<p>“He’s heading this way…”</p>\n<p>“Ah, yes, apparently.”</p>\n<p>Monkey gulped. “It’s different with Snake. Although he looked like that, whatever you do, please, young master, you can’t afford to be rude in front of this elder…”</p>\n<p>From the nervousness in Monkey’s voice Shira found the approaching old man seemed to hail from a more prestigious family than he originally thought.</p>\n<p>“Greeting, elder,” Shira said with his head humbly lowered as soon as he approached.</p>\n<p>The old man chuckled, patted Shira’s head, said, “Ah, Young Master, look how much you’ve grown. It feels like only yesterday how happy you were running around like a little kid you are.”</p>\n<p>Shira nodded hearing that. He glanced beside him, and caught Monkey’s face flabbergasted looking both at the boy and the old man.</p>\n<p>Hiding his embarrassment behind a fake cough, Shira then tried to understand whether the old man mistook him for someone else. “I’m sorry, elder. I don’t know if I’m mistaken, but, have we met before?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, have we met? Of course we’ve--” he stopped. The old man's eyes were covered by a pair of soft hands of a girl.</p>\n<p>“Guess who this is?” the girl who sneakily teased the old man from behind was grinning.</p>\n<p>“Oho! Who is this? Who is this?” the old man smiled delightedly.</p>\n<p>Both Shira and Monkey were tense watching the scene before them. Especially Shira Yashura, who knew that the grin on his cousin’s face always told that the girl enjoyed herself a little bit too much.</p>\n<p>“Isn’t this… Tomboy Princess?” the old man guessed.</p>\n<p>“Tuut! Wrong!”</p>\n<p>Mila released her hands. When the old man turned to see the preparator, he exclaimed with a chuckle.</p>\n<p>“It’s really you, Tomboy Princess.”</p>\n<p>Mila excitedly echoed, “It’s really you, Grandpa Piss!”</p>\n<p>They were so glad they met after a long time that they started to hug each other. Then Mila pull herself from the oldman’s embrace, yelling, “Ugghh…” she pinched her nose, “I smell something pissy around here.”</p>\n<p>Just when Shira and Monkey wondered what Mila meant by that, the girl looked at the old man, saying, “It’s no wonder it smells pissy. Have you taken a bath, Grandpa Piss.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss answered with a laugh. But Shira and Monkey facepalmed.</p>\n<p>So much for being mindful in front of the revered old expert.</p>\n<p>Shira awkwardly smiled to cover his shame. “Mila, you should be mindful in front of elders.”</p>\n<p>“Mindful?” Mila gasped. “In front of Grandpa Piss? Why?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, it’s okay, young master,” the old man said as he waved his hand. “I’m not that old to lose my sense of humor. Yashura Family’s princess sure is as naughty as always.” His wrinkles deepened as he curled his lips into a big smile. He said to Mila, “I reckon Patriarch Shuro’s been well, my princess? I recall he got a lot of migraines back in the day.”</p>\n<p>Haughtily, Mila replied, “Don’t worry about that guy, Grandpa Piss. His brain capacity has been declining these past years so there’s really nothing left inside to give him any headache!”</p>\n<p>“Ehem,” Shira cleared his phlegm. “She meant our patriarch has been well, elder.”</p>\n<p>“That’s what I said,” Mila laughed, and the old man laughed too. After that Mila kissed Grandpa Piss’s right hand as if she was kissing an elder’s hand from her own family, then continued laughing as cheeky as always.</p>\n<p>“My naughty princess,” Grandpa Piss ruffled Mila’s hair, “I planned to visit Yashura Family later. But since we’ve already met, here, please take this.”</p>\n<p>Receiving a pack wrapped in dried leaves, Mila pouted her lips. “You wouldn’t be lying about this being a candy again, would you?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, of course not.”</p>\n<p>As far as her memory served her well, what Grandpa Piss called candy actually a really bitter herb for young children to gain their appetite. Mila sniffed. She opened it and have a little taste. “Uuueeekk!”</p>\n<p>It was sour and even more bitter than she remembered. “What the hell is this?!”</p>\n<p>“That herb’s not for consumption, Young Lady Mila” the big man with muscles, Snake’s big brother, said from behind Grandpa Piss. He was smiling politely despite the other party merely a young lady of a rural village. “It’s a cosmetic for skin care.”</p>\n<p>“Skin care?!”</p>\n<p>Mila’s mouth widened agape. But soon as she glanced at the muscle man who was approaching her, she became wary, leaned to Grandpa Piss and whispered, “Grandpa Piss, who’s that?”</p>\n<p>With a patient smile replied, Grandpa Piss said, “He’s Snotty. Don’t you remember Snotty?”</p>\n<p>Mila was surprised. “Oooohh! Snotty! You’ve turned into a real man now I can’t even recognize you anymore!”</p>\n<p>“Haha… you’re surely jest young lady,” Snotty said.</p>\n<p>“No, really…” with fingers on her chin, eyes on muscles, Mila added, “you really transformed into something new, Snotty. I’m impressed. You were so skinny and really a snotty boy back then.”</p>\n<p>The man continued to laugh. The atmosphere was friendly and harmless. Yet Monkey, who had long heard Snotty’s real identity and preceding reputation from Snake’s mouth, began sweating profusely.</p>\n<p>Mila really loved gifted cosmetics and the like. After knowing how effective it was for her beauty, she shamelessly asked, “Can I ask for more, Grandpa Piss? I have a good friend who needs to be a beauty--as soon as possible!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, of course I have more--here, take this,” Grandpa Piss took out another one.</p>\n<p>“Waow!” Mila’s eyes sparkled in a weird glint. Shira, who saw that, knew his cousin’s greed began to surface; suddenly the unruly young lady acted as if she was a timid maiden. “Grandpa Piss… I think my other friend needs it too…” she asked sweetly.</p>\n<p>“Hohoh!” Grandpa Piss stroked his beard again. “Unfortunately, my princess, I’ve got only three pack and I planned to give the last one for Young Lady Malikh.”</p>\n<p>Hearing a certain short-haired girl being mentioned, the shy maiden’s face twisted in an ugly sour face, returned back to her original color. “Tch.”</p>\n<p>“Hey, don’t click your tongue in front of elders,” Shira warned her.</p>\n<p>“Tch.” Mila crossed her arms and threw away her pouting face.</p>\n<p>Shira was always frustrated whenever a younger one like him would be the one to reprimand ethics into this blockhead of a girl.</p>\n<p>“Now, now, young lady. Please remember Grandpa’s already too old to concoct too many cosmetics--getting two packs already good enough,” Snotty said.</p>\n<p>Snake looked at the leaves wrapped cosmetics in Mila’s hands and exclaimed, “Grandfather concocted them himself?”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss nodded with an amiable smile. “Of course. Been twelve years since the last time I was here. It’d be embarrassing if I came with half-hearted gifts, don’t you think so?”</p>\n<hr>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>The nickname of “Grandpa Piss” stuck on Grandmaster Alchemist’s name for twelve years. When a friend of his asked the origin of this horrible nickname, the Grandmaster laughed it off and said a princess of his old friend’s family started calling him that, because her cousin who was still a three years old brat urinated on him every time the Grandmaster tried to hug him.</p>\n<p>Legend said that the princess was also calling the heir of Grandmaster Alchemist’s family with the nickname of “Snotty”. But even to this day, nobody knows which kingdom this cheeky princess comes from.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n","volume-2/chapter-3":"<p>What the Nalaq told Shira lingered in his mind. Good-Natured Spirit blurted something about killing someone as if it was something trivial that could popped out easily in normal conversation. To kill someone after finding out his secret--what kind of secret he needed to protect anyway? A secret he never wanted people to know the fact he was drawing semi-porns for money. But he wasn’t that insecure to kill someone over a petty secret like that? That would be him being not right in the head. The more he thought about Good-Natured Spirit’s remark, the more it disturbed him. Especially right now, when his hands painted in red, bathed in blood. When he just did an act of actual killing.</p>\n<p>“Something on your mind, Young Master Shira?” a rough voice disturbed his train of thought.</p>\n<p>“Ah,” Shira looked at a burly man, an experienced hunter, who called him.</p>\n<p>The man’s body even drenched in thicker blood than him. One would get easily nauseated by the sight of it. Yet it didn’t make the boy flinched, as he was expecting the experience for a few months already.</p>\n<p>“Here. Look at his gut. Spilling out his innards with your own hands might be a good experience for you, young master.”</p>\n<p>The hunter spun a sharp dagger, holding it by the tip of its blade, having a gesture of offering it to his young master.</p>\n<p>“Is that okay? I even had trouble when skinning the hide,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>He’d rather not, to be honest, since splitting a goat’s gut could be messy if he did it crudely. Even if he was the young master of the family, when messing with the raw meat, not even his uncle could save him from the aunties’ nagging. Shira Yashura was nearly sixteen, almost reaching adulthood, so he had to participate in butchering goats; it was a quite tasking task, but was easy enough compared to butchering cows he had to do in a few years. But for the fifteen years old young master, getting the hang of the butchering knife’s handle was plenty of experience already for him.</p>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>As the custom dictates, every month in ngajen ceremony preparation, the boys will have to deal with cows and goats while the girls help aunties plucking chickens’ and ducks’ feathers. Whether the gatekeepers' children or the family’s next heirs, all of them are required to do it every time a major ceremony approaches.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>After doing his part in butchering a goat Shira immediately took a bath to remove the bloody pungent. On a whim he then strolled to the kitchen to grab some snacks. There he witnessed how all the coconuts he and his uncle shred already transformed into delicious foods; rendang, Bulayak satay, coconut satay, spicy curry, many other mouth drolling coconut cuisines. The coconut loving uncle was all smiles and gave him a big portion of the famous beef cuisine the locals called rendang--which, normally, even for a young master like Shira would get to eat rendang once every few months. But with enough wit and experience in currying favor with his uncle, he got to taste those delicious food handed down by his uncle, the Chief Chef, personally.</p>\n<p>“Shira my boy,” Patriarch Shuro said to his nephew who was squatting below the shadow of a thick pillar, happily munching on his rendang, “you’re going to visit Malikh Family tonight. Keep a good check on your cousin. Don’t embarrass Yashura Family and present our rendang_ _for their main family.”</p>\n<p>“Sure.”</p>\n<hr>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>Domesticated cows were less in numbers than goats in Badril Village, so meals from cows, not including the innards which could be made into popular but cheap cuisines, like only served for village big shots or important visitors during the ngajen ceremony.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>Laughters and chatters made the night more merry than any other thay of the month. It was brighter than usual, as villagers came out of their house to set up big braziers to light the road between the families that were holding festives. From one hundred meters away, through the thick wall of the big families, the mouth-watering aroma of prepared food wafted through the air as if they informally invited people to come and to taste the delicacy these big families had. The change in scenery upon the arrival of the night signaled the nigh of Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>Yashura Family, the oldest family around, was known to have the best food amongst all families in Badril Village, while Elzhier Family known as the family that always threw the biggest party post-ceremony--Elzhier Family’s maidservants were beautiful and they’d show off their voluptuous bodies every single ngajen ceremony. Particularly this month however, everyone was anticipating the ceremony thrown by Malikh Family; for two years since the young lady’s absence they threw nothing more than mediocre festivities, her return was to be seen as their revival on the village’s political stage. And from how big their arrangement looked like, it seemed Malikh Family didn’t plan to fail everyone’s expectations.</p>\n<p>Shira Yashura wore the same suit he got from his uncle on his fifteenth birthday. It was the usual suit he’d wear whenever a ceremony was held. His uncle bought it from a merchant who had connections outside the kingdom, which was pretty good since the fabric wasn’t stiff, but could get unbearably itchy in places he didn’t want to scratch whenever there were people around. The obvious part missing from the wears his peers were wearing was beast pelts.</p>\n<p>Pelts from ferocious beasts were known for irrefutable proof for boys’ courage and manliness. As many young gentlemen of Badril Village wore on their necks, always looking for the opportunity to show off the trophy of their preys to girls--which translated as fashionable fads for boys who wanted to get laids.</p>\n<p>Of course, Shira, as part of the dull and no-nonsense camp of the boys in Badril Village, never had participated in that kind of indecent business. He was so dull that the only girl who would accompany him to attend ceremonies was his cousin Mila--who, even though her face was quite pretty, also happened to be in terrible luck for romance.</p>\n<p>“No matter how many times I see it, it’s always impressive to see how fast you wrap all these banana leaves,” Shira commented as he watched how Mila wrapped rendang with banana leaves. She was very good at it, comparable to the aunties’ skills that had been forged day and night in the family’s kitchen.</p>\n<p>“You talking? You’ve done your training with the family's sword technique, I assume?” Mila said with her lips pouted. Shira thought it was unusual for Mila didn’t nag her mouth off immediately when she saw him. He saw a sword wrapped in cloth near Mila. His face immediately twisted in a troubled look.</p>\n<p>“I won’t bring that thing,” he protested.</p>\n<p>“You--” Mila hissed.</p>\n<p>“What should I do with a sword inside another family’s ceremony?” Shira said. The sword was his father’s, and that was his reason he didn’t want to use it. “Look, I can only draw the blade from the sheath at most. Without a proper amount of Strength attribute I can’t swing this properly. It rejects my mana. I’d make a fool out of myself if that happened.”</p>\n<p>“That’s because you were stupidly increasing your Wisdom instead of, that’s why you--arghh! Just forget about it! I know you’re trying to make excuses! Since you’re so weak all we can do is flaunting around your father’s reputation. We’ve got to remind people that our Yashura Family’s not to mess with. Here, just slip this fucking sword in your belt.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, this is embarrassing. Those rumors are about to get worse tonight,” Shira said with a sigh. His reputation as a trash talent was annoying enough, added this shameless act of throwing his weight around, he’d become more reluctant to show his face in the public later on. But still he unwillingly slipped the sword in his belt.</p>\n<p>Mila snorted. She ignored the complaint. Right now she could care less about the rumors about her cousin. What she had to prioritize tonight was the bad premonition she had about Bhela Malikh’s short hair--nobody believed her when she said that Bhela was being a slut for cutting her hair short in spite of her being in an engagement. While her hands craftly knotted the rendang wrapped in banana leaves with a rope made with dried coconut leaves, she suddenly had a cold smile; the image of those impudent Malikhs shuddering under the famous sword of Yashura Family’s Unique Class, Jhuro Yashura the Blackfang Swordsman, entertained her she began to chuckle coldly.</p>\n<p>“Huhuhu… just you wait you bitch…”</p>\n<p>Shira stepped back. He had the hunch he should keep a distance away from his current cousin right now.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Every month, for every family in Badril Village, cooking during the Ngajen Ceremony was always a time rushing hectic. Even more in Malikh Family this time. Since the amount of food they had to deliver before the ceremony started more than twice the amount they made last month, most of the aunties in duty were cooking outdoors. The smoke from the half-dried firewood would be too unbearable for the eyes if all of them cooked in one cramped place. Fortunately, most of the dishes were already cooked and sent to the courtyard, so the only people who were still on duty preparing food were a small number of aunties and maidservants.</p>\n<p>The young maidservants were pale from tiredness but they couldn’t afford to slack in this one Ngajen Ceremony. The usual noisy aunties, they didn’t even show a sign of wanting to rest. Nobody could beat the resilience of the kitchen-duty armies when it came to preparing for a loadful of party’s foods.</p>\n<p>Usually, the one who would supervise these spartan cooking aunties would be the patriarch’s wife, Bhela’s mother. It was already a long-held tradition in the village for the patriarch to cook for the family’s important guests as the Chief Chef, while the wife supported him by supervising the aunties and maidservants. In Ngajen Ceremony this month, however, Bhela’s mother holed herself to accompany the husband on his ill-bed.</p>\n<p>She was not in the mood to meet with people. So Bhela stepped in to fill her position.</p>\n<p>Back when she was little Bhela often followed her mother working during the ngajen ceremony, she knew what she had to do by the back of her hand. In usage of salt, for example, she knew down to the tiniest detail of how much salt should be applied to different kinds of cuisines. She also instructed the inexperienced maidservants who were in charge of cooking side dishes so the overall quality of the feast would be balanced. Bhela Malikh didn’t betray everyone’s expectations about her. She did her work splendidly.</p>\n<p>However, there was a matter she saw that didn’t make her happy. The largest furnace that was usually reserved for the Chief Chef, today was used by an old man from the outer family. A great cook, the old man was. Known for his vast experience in handling the family’s food stalls for years. The problem was his common status. Without at least an elder status made it awkward for him to cook as the Chief Chef in this kitchen, even if he was a mere proxy. Bhela wondered whether the one who took the charge when her parents were unavailable knew the risk of being laughed at and criticized by the other two big families--especially now that the relationship between Yashura and Malikh wasn’t that good like before.</p>\n<p>“Young lady, the day’s getting dark, you should take a bath now and prepare yourself for the ceremony,” an aunty said to Bhela.</p>\n<p>“Yes, young lady is no longer a little girl, so making you pretty will take a while,” an early twenty maidservant added from the side. She continued, “The new girls should be able to complete the foods since you directed them a lot. Please don’t worry about us.”</p>\n<p>“I’m relieved to hear that,” Bhela said. Not yet three seconds later her eyes wandered to the old cook again. She couldn’t hide her frown.</p>\n<p>“Something the matter, Young Lady Bhela?”</p>\n<p>“Yes. Maybe it’s a misunderstanding on my part but… I can’t see the elder who would substitute my father as the Chief Chef.”</p>\n<p>Hearing Bhela said her concern, the aunties and the maidservants averted eyes with their young lady with troubled faces. Bhela then understood there was something shady going on.</p>\n<p>Her suspicion turned worse when she saw a young man in his twenties leading four manservants with him. When the aunties were working in the kitchen, it was an unspoken rule for unrelated adult men not to approach, but the battle-hardened aunties that normally were ferocious in defending their territories were all silent in welcoming the cocky visitors. It wasn’t surprising to Bhela that all of them came from Elder Jhamil’s faction.</p>\n<p>“Why aren’t you ready yet, old worm?!”</p>\n<p>“I am sorry, young elder… some dish cannot be rushed so I prepared some to--”</p>\n<p><em>Slap!!</em></p>\n<p>The slapping sound echoed in the kitchen. The room descended into a dead silent. The old cook was trembling; he lowered his head and covered the cheek that just got slapped but everyone could see the blood on the corner of his mouth. Bhela recollected her memory, and finally remembered the arrogant young man was actually Elder Jhamil’s own son.</p>\n<p>“Shit!” Elder Jhamil’s son swore, “those councils from Village Hall came. We must complete the set before too long! Those people are the ones who usually have the heaviest voice when valuing Ngajen Ceremony dishes!”</p>\n<p>One follower quipped, “Young elder is right. This old worm can’t cook shit! If this goes on, the only things the Village Hall council will remember about Elder Jhamil’s cooking is that we Malikhs cook as slow as snail!”</p>\n<p>The frown on Bhela’s face became deeper. Young elder? Before she went out for the seminars that lasted two years, this man, son of Elder Jhamil, merely a family member with a post within the family’s business. And something else that disturbed her was how she couldn’t see how the blurted about Elder Jhamil’s cooking, the one who worked in the kitchen all day, didn’t see the said elder even once today.</p>\n<p>Bhela still held her silent. But her eyes were cold and sharp judging people and the situation. The aunties and the maidservants, though they looked sympathetic with the old man, were afraid to go against Elder Jhamil’s son. Maybe because the lack of resistance Elder Jhamil’s son dared to do a taboo known in the kitchen--swapping food that wrapped in banana leaves with ceramic plates, garnished a bit, and called it the Chief Chef’s cuisine.</p>\n<p>“No, young elder!” a brave middle-aged aunty stepped forward, “you can’t do that!”</p>\n<p>“Why not?” one follower sneered in Elder Jhamil’s son’s place. “This one also got beef, isn’t it? We need to quickly serve the Chief Chef cuisine to the people from Village Hall councils.”</p>\n<p>“Exactly because they are from the Village Hall council--just from inferior cuts of the beef they’d know the dishes have been swapped! You’ll tarnish Malikh Family’s honor if people knew you were fooling--”</p>\n<p>“Fooling?!” Elder Jhamil roared.</p>\n<p>The young elder raised his hand, though the aunty who complained quickly hid back behind the maidservants. Elder Jhamil’s son then rampaged into a series of barking, yelling and threatening the aunties to cut their salary just because his mood was spoiled.</p>\n<p>His words scared all the girls and the women inside the kitchen. All except Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>After they were done swapping the foods, the young elder led his men out of the kitchen with great swagger. The young elder stopped at the door, turned around, and gave the old cook one last ultimatum: “There’ll be a noble in the ceremony so we need rendang for the main course. So go make it, old worm. You know what’s gonna happen if you couldn’t deliver, don’t you?”</p>\n<p>The old man trembled. Even the eyes on the aunties couldn’t help but shake at the threat. There was now way they could prepare rendang with only two hours remaining until the Ngajen Ceremony started.</p>\n<p>After that situation calmed down. The aunties and the maidservants went back to work. Some of them still exchanged whispered and gossiped amongst themselves. But when Bhela approached, immediately they stopped and pretended nothing happened.</p>\n<p>“Young lady…” a pudgy aunty came to her, the one who stood up against the young elder from before.</p>\n<p>“Aunty?”</p>\n<p>“We are sorry… we’ve had no meaning to show you that embarrassing scene.”</p>\n<p>Bhela shook her head. “No, I’m one from the main family bloodline; I should've been the one who stood up to him instead of hiding behind everyone.”</p>\n<p>The aunty knew the young lady didn’t say a word before because the girl wanted to know the situation. Some other middle-aged aunties who were close with Madam Malikh also knew more or less Bhela’s detached wait-and-see attitude, so no one really would blame her even if she didn’t say a word before--especially since she had just returned from overseas. The pudgy aunty tugged on Bhela’s sleeve, whispered to her ear, “Young Lady Bhela, we know you’re concerned. But we’ve already gotten used to it. You’re still young. Your future is brighter than everyone else in the family, Young Lady Bhela. It’s better to endure than pointlessly making enemies.”</p>\n<p>“This isn’t pointless,” Bhela said. She then grabbed the nearest apron and wore it. Her father was the patriarch. And she wasn’t a poster girl to draw everyone’s attention to the family.</p>\n<p>The pudgy aunty wanted to say something again. But words stuck on her throat, she closed her mouth as soon as she opened it.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the old man began to pick some mature coconut and shredded it listlessly. He got more than four decades of handling food stalls for Malikh Family, he wasn’t a stranger at cooking rendang. But he already gave up on finishing one for tonight’s Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>“Uncle, I’ll take it from here,” Bhela said as she approached the weary old man.</p>\n<p>“Ahh, yes?” the old man was started. The girl came with an apron and common garment, had fair and beautiful skin, as well clear and articulate voice; a maidservant from the inner family was the first one that came to his mind. But only when he noticed even the aunties were respectful to her and her striking bob-cut short hair that the old man began drenched in cold sweat.</p>\n<p>“I said, uncle,” Bhela repeated, “I’ll take it from here. You can rest now.”</p>\n<p>The old man vigorously shook his head.</p>\n<p>“Please Young Lady Bhela… please spare this old bone….”</p>\n<p>“This is originally my father’s post, uncle. You’ll have to be at least an elder and write your name in council’s ledger to be a substitute for my father.”</p>\n<p>The old man wanted to break into a tearless cry. This is worse than when he faced Elder Jhamil’s son's harassment before. The most thing he was afraid of was the news of Elder Jhamil using him as Chief Chef behind the scene to reach the ears of the main family. And now that Bhela Malikh was here, there was nothing he could do but to resign his life to fate.</p>\n<p>“Y-young lady!” a maidservant yelled, “you can’t!”</p>\n<p>“Who says I can’t?” Bhela asked sharply.</p>\n<p>An aunty, who had a stern-looking face, said, “You can’t cook for the main course, young lady. In case of a patriarch's absence, usually one of the elders who’s going to take his place. There’s no rule saying it’s okay for women to do it.”</p>\n<p>“Then, I’m going to ask,” from the aunty, Bhela threw her glance toward the old man, “are you an elder cooking here to substitute my father as a cook, uncle?”</p>\n<p>The old man’s face turned pale. Whichever the answer of that question would lead him to the road of punishment. All of the sudden, he became a mute.</p>\n<p>Because she had the most standing, nobody made a sound when Young Lady Bhela Malikh asked them to fetch chickens and spices for her.</p>\n<p>Not long after, the story about how the Young Lady of Malikh Family wanted to substitute her father spread like a wildfire. Never in Badril Village’s history would a young lady do that. A crowd of curious males, mostly the youngsters from main and outer of Malikh Family, surrounded the kitchen as they wanted to catch a glimpse of how their beautiful young lady recklessly challenged the custom by her own. The boys sighed in admiration. Bhela Malikh was essentially an Archer at heart. But the way she handled a blade, even if it was a kitchen knife, was skillful and graceful, as every time her slim wrist stopped moving from cutting down a vegetable, a wave of gulping could be heard. The boys couldn’t take their eyes from her. The reckless and brave young lady was simply too charming.</p>\n<p>“Did you know that foreigners often confuse rendang as dried curry?” Bhela said to one maidservant who stared at the way she cooked. “Curry leaves originated from an area close to western Haldeen lands, so many local Mossacks sailed the sea to try their luck making it big working for western empires.”</p>\n<p>The usual aloof Bhela unusually was talkative when she was cooking, which was quite a big surprise for people who were watching. She explained to the clueless maidservants how, during her two years travelling in seminars from countries to countries, found many noble owned restaurants claimed to serve rendang but turned out to be dried curry. All the while sharply focused on doing her cooking duty.</p>\n<p>“Young lady!” from the crowd came out an angry bald man. He was Elder Jhamil. “W-what are you doing there?”</p>\n<p>“I’m cooking,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“But you can’t work there!” Elder Jhamil yelled. “No woman can substitute for patriarch! That’s against the rule!”</p>\n<p>“I don’t recall we have a rule like that.”</p>\n<p>“If you know why you still stand there?”</p>\n<p>“Neither do I recall a rule for an elder to use a stand-in for the Chief Chef position.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s face turned weird as if he suddenly got constipated. Many of the youngsters didn’t catch Bhela’s remarks nor they cared too much about it, but some in the crowd were nodding knowingly, as many of them were familiar with how shady Elder Jhamil was doing things.</p>\n<p>As the bald elder’s head was racing fast looking for an answer to defuse the young lady’s claim, suddenly, a loud roar exploded behind him.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela, who do you think you are? Just because your father is the family’s patriarch you think you can do whatever you want?!”</p>\n<p>The faces of aunties and the maidservants twitched. They witnessed how the young elder harassed the old man before, so they were itching to throw back the same question at him instead, though no more brave aunties dared to cause more troubles.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s son continued, “The ingredient for making Chief dishes takes money, young lady. Not even the patriarch himself has the daring to use coins from the treasury for himself. Do you want to embarrass your parents that much?”</p>\n<p>“I’m not making this food for myself nor I cook for my father. It’s for the guests. And I provided the spices and the foreign curry leaves by myself,” Bhela said. Some maidservants behind her nodded nervously as Bhela indeed ordered them to fetch spices from the personal kitchen in the main family’s residential area.</p>\n<p>In spite of that, the young elder kept pushing on with nasty smile on his face.</p>\n<p>“What about the chicken, young lady? They cost money! What do you say about that, huh?”</p>\n<p>Behind Bhela, the aunties, even the maidservants, were whispering at each other on how ridiculous it was to question the sole young generation of Malikh Family main bloodline over some chickens. Even Bhela, the young lady in question, would only glanced at the troubled expression of Elder Jhamil.</p>\n<p>“I will pay for the chicken,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Ha? Pay? With what? Your father’s money? Can’t a sick person even pay the cost of the foods for ngajen ceremony all by himself?”</p>\n<p>“No need to bring my father’s name here.” Bhela said with a dangerously cold tone.</p>\n<p>The chillness in her eyes was telling that she really did hate people bringing her parents’ name in bad faith. After hearing gasps of surprise from people that didn’t expect the usually silent young lady could utter something with such a biting tone, she sighed, said with an explanation, “I got a dress as a gift from a certain person who has too much money in his pocket. He said the dress is so valuable even the princesses wear them in parties. It should cover the cost of these chickens I’m going to cook if I sell the dress right here right now.”</p>\n<p>Bhela then tilted her head and glanced at the bald elder.</p>\n<p>“Am I right, Elder Jhamil?”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil wanted to maintain his smile, but his face went stiff as stone. He was trembling inside for knowing that the dress he acquired with a large sum of money and with his best connection, valued the same as some mere village chickens in Bhela’s eyes.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, his son, who was taken aback for a bit from the cold remark Bhela had said earlier, recovered, began to yell again, “Ha! Did you not train your brain when you were overseas, my young lady? The same dress princesses wear in parties? Only someone dumb believe that! Hah! Obviously you’ve been lied to! You’ve been crooked, young lady, crooked--”</p>\n<p><em>Paak!</em></p>\n<p>From behind, the already red-faced Elder Jhamil smacked his son’s head. “You’ve been rude to Young Lady Bhela, you dumbskull! You have to apologize! Young lady can’t bear to hear it anymore!”</p>\n<p>While in fact it was him who couldn’t bear to hear being called a crook.</p>\n<p>“Apologize!” Elder Jhamil roared.</p>\n<p><em>Splash!</em></p>\n<p>The pair father and son’s performance didn’t amuse Bhela, however. With the lid in her hand, Bhela scooped boiling curry broth and splashed it to their direction. Surprised, the stupid young elder swore with nasty words while his father cried in high-pitched voice.</p>\n<p>“Please get out,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil laughed wryly.</p>\n<p>“Please don’t be like that, young lady. I know my son doesn't have the best education but--”</p>\n<p><em>Splash!!</em></p>\n<p>Bhela waved the cooking lid once again as soon as Elder Jhamil stepped forward. The hot water splashed on his expensive boots. This time, while he didn’t expect for Bhela splashing hot water at him again, he wasn’t freaking out. It seemed his plan to make the young lady behave a little backfiring instead. His face turned solemn.</p>\n<p>“Young lady…”</p>\n<p>“I’m not going to say it thrice--everyone who has nothing to do in the kitchen, please get out,” Bhela said. “Or else--”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The major families’ lands were astonishingly spacious and complex, their walls were thick and tall, therefore each of them employed a few stationary guards for the main gate as gatekeepers. These gatekeepers, though usually filled by members of the outer part of the families, their duty were significantly more important than others since they represented the face of the family they served. So they always maintain polite gestures to everyone who came through their gate, either commoners or rich people from big families. Yet when Shira and Mila arrived the Malikh Family’s gatekeepers didn’t even hide their scoffs.</p>\n<p>“Ridiculous!” she hissed with a face boiled in anger, “even lowly gatekeepers are looking down on us!”</p>\n<p>“Don’t bother with them,” Shira said. Unlike his cousin’s furious temper, his flair seemed like he shrugged the blatant disrespect, as the holder of “Eternal Novice” title he was already numb by how people were talking behind his back.</p>\n<p>“If your father was here they’d bow their asses as soon as they saw us Yashura coming.”</p>\n<p>Shira shrugged his shoulders again.</p>\n<p>Still seething in anger, Mila cast her eyes on the banana leaves wrapped food in Shira’s hands. “Who should we give the rendang to?” she asked.</p>\n<p>“Let’s just give it to a random servant.” Then Shira called a maidservant who was carrying a tray full of food. “Excuse me!”</p>\n<p>“Yes? What can I help y--” The moment this maidservant turned her head and saw Shira’s face, she immediately threw back her eyes and escaped with hurried trot, pretending she saw nothing.</p>\n<p>“The fuck?!” Mila was flastergabbed, didn’t know what to say.</p>\n<p>Later on Shira and Mila realized how unpopular Yashura Family was to the current Malikhs, even the servants who usually held no voice in the family were avoiding the pair of cousins like plague. Their attitude especially worsened when it came to Shira Yashura.</p>\n<p>“Look there,” someone whispered amongst the guests, “Yashura Family send their eldest young miss and the young master! Out of all the Ngajen Ceremony, they choose tonight to show their faces--pretty obvious, eh? Bet they’re drooling to get another Unique Class after knowing our Young Lady Bhela’s real talent tonight!”</p>\n<p>Someone else agreed and replied, “With that kind of trash as their young master, they’d be dreamin’ to get even a touch of our Young Lady Bhela. Pueh!”</p>\n<p>Hearing the muffled disdain, Mila Yashura whirled her body, glaring people with eagle eyes. “Who said that?!” she growled.</p>\n<p>“Mila…” Shira held her shoulder.</p>\n<p>“The fuckers don’t even put our Yashura Family in their eyes. Just because shitty rumors about Unique Class they started to feel high and mighty, eh?”</p>\n<p>“Just let go, Uncle Shuro didn’t send us here to start troubles,” Shira said. “All we need to do is to show our faces here and give them our rendang. It’s not our problem whether they welcome our good intention with grace or not.”</p>\n<p>Though Shira said that, he secretly hoped Malikh Family would grow too proud to receive it--all so he had an excuse to keep his uncle’s rendang for himself.</p>\n<p>A commotion arose. People hussing here and there with excitement. When Shira and Mila wanted to know what was going on, a parade of beautiful young women glittering and stealing the whole show came from inside of Malikh Family’s hall. Leading them was a short-haired young beauty, face as icy as an ice sculpture, the recent name that everyone had been talking about these days, Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>It was clear from the way Bhela positioned herself she represented the family as the ceremony’s Chief Chef.</p>\n<p>“Whoa, so Malikh Family let her do that,” Shira murmured.</p>\n<p>Not to mention being the Chief Chef--the most Shira did in his family’s kitchen was helping his uncle, helping him shred coconuts. They were at the same age, but the same old Shira still practiced butchering goats while the supposed fiancée of his was climbing the social ladder. Even Mila was angry by the special treatment Malikh Family gave to their young lady.</p>\n<p>“Sup, young master!” from behind a voice called him.</p>\n<p>Shira turned around, found the one who greeted him was Monkey.</p>\n<p>“Who?” Mila asked Shira as the stranger with a monkey-like face approaching.</p>\n<p>“This one is called by the name of Monkey, young lady,” Monkey, with his self-trained Mossack’s style bowing gesture, introduced himself smoothly.</p>\n<p>Mila hummed in ackwnoledgement. It was harder to forget than remembering someone with such combination of face and awkward name.</p>\n<p>“Mister Monkey, I thought you’ll spend the ceremony to show Mister Snake around since he’s an outsider. What are you doing in Malikh Family?” Shira asked.</p>\n<p>“Now, now, please drop the ‘Mister’, young master. I’m not that old yet to be called as such,” Monkey said, then he continued explaining his story this evening. “We were planning to go to your family’s ceremony, young master. But who would have thought Snake to meet with his relatives here? His relatives are actually Malikh Family’s guests for tonight’s Ngajen Ceremony. Bet he got to eat expensive cuisines right now.”</p>\n<p>“Well, it’ll be easier with Mister Snake here. I’ve got some coins I want to show you, I wonder if it works to use them for--” Shira sneakily glanced at his cousin, then turned back to Monkey like it was nothing, “--for the thing we talked about yesterday.”</p>\n<p>Mila sneered, “You have some business to attend, no?”</p>\n<p>“Not really, no,” Shira shrugged off her question.</p>\n<p>“Really, though?” Mila crossed her arms, sneered again. “I think I saw Romana just now. I’mma chat with her a little bit.”</p>\n<p>It seemed to Shira that his cousin meeting with Romana here, in Malikh Family’s Ngajen Ceremony, wasn’t simply to have fun. He didn’t like his cousin would make trouble but he didn’t want to spend the whole night with her either. “Don’t go home without me,” he said eventually.</p>\n<p>“Hmph! You’re not a kid anymore but still need me to accompany you home?”</p>\n<p>No, Shira actually was more worried about her than himself.</p>\n<p>He then glanced beside and said, “Mister Monkey.”</p>\n<p>“Just Monkey,” Monkey corrected.</p>\n<p>“Mister Just Monkey, you said Mister Snake with relative? And his relatives are Malikh Family’s guests?”</p>\n<p>“Not Just Mon--ah, forget about it,” Monkey already gave up guessing whether Young Master Shira Yashura was purposely pulling his leg or not. “They really were Malikh Family’s guests, they even got the front row for the prayer and all.”</p>\n<p>“Is hard for us to be friendly if Mister Snake is involved with Malikh Family.”</p>\n<p>“You mean, that, huh? Well, I’ve been here for a while and they talked about you a lot, so I guess even someone as chill as you can get angry sometimes. But you don’t have to worry about those Malikhs, Young Master Shira. As long as their patriarch is Ghalim Malikh they won’t sever ties with Yashura so easily.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, is this your opinion?”</p>\n<p>“It’s Snake’s. It’s what he said before he met his relatives.”</p>\n<p>Shira thought the Alchemist he met once before was a total stranger of Badril Village, but it appeared he was wrong. “He really does know about Malikh Family that much, doesn’t he?”</p>\n<p>“Well, yeah, but I think he’s more familiar with Yashura than Malikh Family, though,” Monkey said, crossing his arms and nodded to himself as he recalled things that Snake told him to get his wares supported by Yashura Family; for example, obtaining Butler Yulong’s permission the same as Patriarch Shuro Yashura’s, Snake once said.</p>\n<p>“What? Why do you make that kind of face, Young Master Shira?” Monkey was snapped from his train of thought.</p>\n<p>“Ah, no, I just don’t expect you’re going to say some like that.”</p>\n<p>“What are you saying, young master. In the first place, Snake became my crew because he heard I’ve some dealing with Yashura Family.”</p>\n<p>Shira did recall the first time Monkey contacted Yashura Family--through him. To be more exact, the first item Monkey dealt from Malikh Family was Shira’s smuggled erotic painting that Good-Natured Spirit rejected.</p>\n<p>“--Speaking of Snake,” with his thumb Monkey did point in a certain direction. The place was separated from the common guest as they indeed were Malikh Family’s special guests. Shira’s eyes followed and he saw the familiar Alchemist he knew not long ago, Snake, was talking with two men, young and old, most likely brother and his grandfather.</p>\n<p>“Don’t be fooled by their appearances, young master. They’re renowned experts,” Monkey said.</p>\n<p>The pair of brother and grandfather wore worn out pale robes as their clothes, unlike the image of revered experts in Shira’s mind. Monkey told him both likely to travel incognito for various reasons. The old man had an old white hair and long beard, his back crooked and had to bring a walking staff to support himself, and gave people the impression of a sleepy grandpa from the dim light on his eyes. The young one though, had an always angry-looking face with fierce brows, crossing his muscle-thick arms, locked in a debate with Snake. Snake’s face was notably paler than when Shira met him in the market.</p>\n<p>“We can’t greet Mister Snake now, can we?” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think we can,” Monkey said. Even though he long considered Snake as his partner, the two guests appearing incognito were still the main members of the revered Alchemist family. This was no time for commoners like him acting friendly on them all of the sudden.</p>\n<p>The sleepy-looking old man, noticing two pairs of eyes looking at him, he raised his head. He caught the sight of Shira. Their eyes met.</p>\n<p>“Oh ho,” the old man smiled when he found the boy. He dragged his old body to approach the flastergabbed Shira and Monkey.</p>\n<p>Even Monkey who knew more about them wouldn’t expect Snake’s relatives to introduce themselves first.</p>\n<p>“He’s heading this way…”</p>\n<p>“Ah, yes, apparently.”</p>\n<p>Monkey gulped. “It’s different with Snake. Although he looked like that, whatever you do, please, young master, you can’t afford to be rude in front of this elder…”</p>\n<p>From the nervousness in Monkey’s voice Shira found the approaching old man seemed to hail from a more prestigious family than he originally thought.</p>\n<p>“Greeting, elder,” Shira said with his head humbly lowered as soon as he approached.</p>\n<p>The old man chuckled, patted Shira’s head, said, “Ah, Young Master, look how much you’ve grown. It feels like only yesterday how happy you were running around like a little kid you are.”</p>\n<p>Shira nodded hearing that. He glanced beside him, and caught Monkey’s face flabbergasted looking both at the boy and the old man.</p>\n<p>Hiding his embarrassment behind a fake cough, Shira then tried to understand whether the old man mistook him for someone else. “I’m sorry, elder. I don’t know if I’m mistaken, but, have we met before?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, have we met? Of course we’ve--” he stopped. The old man's eyes were covered by a pair of soft hands of a girl.</p>\n<p>“Guess who this is?” the girl who sneakily teased the old man from behind was grinning.</p>\n<p>“Oho! Who is this? Who is this?” the old man smiled delightedly.</p>\n<p>Both Shira and Monkey were tense watching the scene before them. Especially Shira Yashura, who knew that the grin on his cousin’s face always told that the girl enjoyed herself a little bit too much.</p>\n<p>“Isn’t this… Tomboy Princess?” the old man guessed.</p>\n<p>“Tuut! Wrong!”</p>\n<p>Mila released her hands. When the old man turned to see the preparator, he exclaimed with a chuckle.</p>\n<p>“It’s really you, Tomboy Princess.”</p>\n<p>Mila excitedly echoed, “It’s really you, Grandpa Piss!”</p>\n<p>They were so glad they met after a long time that they started to hug each other. Then Mila pull herself from the oldman’s embrace, yelling, “Ugghh…” she pinched her nose, “I smell something pissy around here.”</p>\n<p>Just when Shira and Monkey wondered what Mila meant by that, the girl looked at the old man, saying, “It’s no wonder it smells pissy. Have you taken a bath, Grandpa Piss.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss answered with a laugh. But Shira and Monkey facepalmed.</p>\n<p>So much for being mindful in front of the revered old expert.</p>\n<p>Shira awkwardly smiled to cover his shame. “Mila, you should be mindful in front of elders.”</p>\n<p>“Mindful?” Mila gasped. “In front of Grandpa Piss? Why?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, it’s okay, young master,” the old man said as he waved his hand. “I’m not that old to lose my sense of humor. Yashura Family’s princess sure is as naughty as always.” His wrinkles deepened as he curled his lips into a big smile. He said to Mila, “I reckon Patriarch Shuro’s been well, my princess? I recall he got a lot of migraines back in the day.”</p>\n<p>Haughtily, Mila replied, “Don’t worry about that guy, Grandpa Piss. His brain capacity has been declining these past years so there’s really nothing left inside to give him any headache!”</p>\n<p>“Ehem,” Shira cleared his phlegm. “She meant our patriarch has been well, elder.”</p>\n<p>“That’s what I said,” Mila laughed, and the old man laughed too. After that Mila kissed Grandpa Piss’s right hand as if she was kissing an elder’s hand from her own family, then continued laughing as cheeky as always.</p>\n<p>“My naughty princess,” Grandpa Piss ruffled Mila’s hair, “I planned to visit Yashura Family later. But since we’ve already met, here, please take this.”</p>\n<p>Receiving a pack wrapped in dried leaves, Mila pouted her lips. “You wouldn’t be lying about this being a candy again, would you?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, of course not.”</p>\n<p>As far as her memory served her well, what Grandpa Piss called candy actually a really bitter herb for young children to gain their appetite. Mila sniffed. She opened it and have a little taste. “Uuueeekk!”</p>\n<p>It was sour and even more bitter than she remembered. “What the hell is this?!”</p>\n<p>“That herb’s not for consumption, Young Lady Mila” the big man with muscles, Snake’s big brother, said from behind Grandpa Piss. He was smiling politely despite the other party merely a young lady of a rural village. “It’s a cosmetic for skin care.”</p>\n<p>“Skin care?!”</p>\n<p>Mila’s mouth widened agape. But soon as she glanced at the muscle man who was approaching her, she became wary, leaned to Grandpa Piss and whispered, “Grandpa Piss, who’s that?”</p>\n<p>With a patient smile replied, Grandpa Piss said, “He’s Snotty. Don’t you remember Snotty?”</p>\n<p>Mila was surprised. “Oooohh! Snotty! You’ve turned into a real man now I can’t even recognize you anymore!”</p>\n<p>“Haha… you’re surely jest young lady,” Snotty said.</p>\n<p>“No, really…” with fingers on her chin, eyes on muscles, Mila added, “you really transformed into something new, Snotty. I’m impressed. You were so skinny and really a snotty boy back then.”</p>\n<p>The man continued to laugh. The atmosphere was friendly and harmless. Yet Monkey, who had long heard Snotty’s real identity and preceding reputation from Snake’s mouth, began sweating profusely.</p>\n<p>Mila really loved gifted cosmetics and the like. After knowing how effective it was for her beauty, she shamelessly asked, “Can I ask for more, Grandpa Piss? I have a good friend who needs to be a beauty--as soon as possible!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, of course I have more--here, take this,” Grandpa Piss took out another one.</p>\n<p>“Waow!” Mila’s eyes sparkled in a weird glint. Shira, who saw that, knew his cousin’s greed began to surface; suddenly the unruly young lady acted as if she was a timid maiden. “Grandpa Piss… I think my other friend needs it too…” she asked sweetly.</p>\n<p>“Hohoh!” Grandpa Piss stroked his beard again. “Unfortunately, my princess, I’ve got only three pack and I planned to give the last one for Young Lady Malikh.”</p>\n<p>Hearing a certain short-haired girl being mentioned, the shy maiden’s face twisted in an ugly sour face, returned back to her original color. “Tch.”</p>\n<p>“Hey, don’t click your tongue in front of elders,” Shira warned her.</p>\n<p>“Tch.” Mila crossed her arms and threw away her pouting face.</p>\n<p>Shira was always frustrated whenever a younger one like him would be the one to reprimand ethics into this blockhead of a girl.</p>\n<p>“Now, now, young lady. Please remember Grandpa’s already too old to concoct too many cosmetics--getting two packs already good enough,” Snotty said.</p>\n<p>Snake looked at the leaves wrapped cosmetics in Mila’s hands and exclaimed, “Grandfather concocted them himself?”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss nodded with an amiable smile. “Of course. Been twelve years since the last time I was here. It’d be embarrassing if I came with half-hearted gifts, don’t you think so?”</p>\n<hr>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>The nickname of “Grandpa Piss” stuck on Grandmaster Alchemist’s name for twelve years. When a friend of his asked the origin of this horrible nickname, the Grandmaster laughed it off and said a princess of his old friend’s family started calling him that, because her cousin who was still a three years old brat urinated on him every time the Grandmaster tried to hug him.</p>\n<p>Legend said that the princess was also calling the heir of Grandmaster Alchemist’s family with the nickname of “Snotty”. But even to this day, nobody knows which kingdom this cheeky princess comes from.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n","volume-2/chapter-4-5":"<p>Badril Village, though had been two years passed without her presence, was the same as always for Bhela Malikh. She hadn’t that many acquaintances her age she could consider friendly before. In spite of that, from the day she returned, people act as if they were her rekindled childhood friends she never knew she had.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” a daughter of an elder from Elzhier Family asked curiously, “is the rumor about that story true?”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at her with eyelids half-closed.</p>\n<p>“Which rumor?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, silly you, of course <em>that</em> rumor! The one about your romance with a blue blood noble!”</p>\n<p>Giggles of girls followed after the girl’s words. When Bhela returned to Badril Village she brought not only fame and reputation, but interesting stories and rumors as well. She was currently surrounded by curious young ladies who sought for exciting gossip.</p>\n<p>“Yeah, yeah!” another girl excitedly hussing in low voice. “I heard he’ll attend Malikh’s ngajen ceremony tonight!”</p>\n<p>“Really?”</p>\n<p>“Why else would Young Lady Bhela take the Chef Chief position if she didn’t expect for her lover to come tonight? He’ll come for sure!”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, yeah, everybody is saying Young Lady Bhela doing just for that!”</p>\n<p>Bhela found it was amazing how people could conjure their own rumors despite not seeing the true story by their own eyes.</p>\n<p>And just when the young ladies started getting excited discussing Young Lady Bhela’s ‘love life’, a vigorous shout resounded the courtyard announcing that Blackwood Family had arrived.</p>\n<p>“Blackwood Family?” someone cocked their head and looked over the direction of the gate. “What kind of family is so bold announcing their names in other family’s ngajen ceremony? Not even Village Head’s Elzhier Family would do to the ceremony host!”</p>\n<p>“Only foreigners to be that stupid to be rude in big family like Malikh! If this is my place I’d send a guard to kick their ass out as soon as possible!”</p>\n<p>“Look over there! Malikh Family elders are rushing to the gate! Let’s check out how’s Malikhs going to deal with it!”</p>\n<p>Curious guests were tailing the elders to see some commotion they thought would occur. However, not only did the Malikhs not make a fuss over it, they even bowed their heads toward the newly arrived noble as if they were servants greeting their returning master. Young people were overly excited because nobles were foreign and appeared in stories all of their lives.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Mila, who already went back with her friend, was gritting teeth with anger. Beside her Romana was holding the tomboy back, though concerned she didn't say a word.</p>\n<p>“Why should I am the one who always had to hold myself back?” Mila hissed in a low voice as if she was wronged.</p>\n<p>“Look around and think about who’s receiving the blow the most. Everyone’s talking about your cousin right now--do you want to make it worse for him?”</p>\n<p>After hearing her friend’s warning, Mila began to take a deep breath and think things through. Romana was right. When she opened her ears Mila could hear people comparing the young master of this noble Blackwood Family with her cousin Shira. They compared such a gallant-looking young noble with a trash of Yashura Family young master, adding with their own biased seasoning here and there, making her cousin Shira look really bad. Mila trembled as her face boiled red from holding back her anger.</p>\n<p>“Where’s Shira right now?”</p>\n<p>“I think he went hiding!” Romana said.</p>\n<p>“Hiding?! He’s embarrassed to show his face that much?”</p>\n<p>After circling around a bit, Mila found the boy’s silhouette in the shadow far from the braziers' light. There, he was squatting, hiding along with two other silhouettes who were also squatting in a suspicious manner.</p>\n<p>“Now, young master, where the hell did you get this coin?” someone whispered from the suspicious bunch.</p>\n<p>The reply came also in the same hushed manner. “Don’t ask me now, just know I’ve got a few more hidden in my house. I can’t move my family, but if you’re fine with this, I can invest in your goods earlier.”</p>\n<p>“We’re fine? Of course we’re fine! Don’t you know how amazing this coin is?”</p>\n<p>“It’s amazing? I can’t even buy satays with this. Nobody here would receive unfamiliar currency.”</p>\n<p>“But don’t you know how far ahead you can go if merchants know you grab some of these coins?”</p>\n<p>“You tell me.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, these coins weren’t issued by any countries, but they’re valuable. Lots of herbs and ingredients in the black markets can only be bought with these coins...”</p>\n<p><em>...whisper whisper whisper...</em></p>\n<p>Mila approached.</p>\n<p>“Ey, what are you doing?!”</p>\n<p>For some reasons, Shira and Monkey, one of his companions, almost jumped in fright by her barking. Both Mila and Romana behind her saw Shira and Monkey were acting suspicious--but Sneak, the third silhouette, didn’t even try to hide that he was nibbling on something delicious.</p>\n<p>Mila, with a weird face, hissed, “Is that… <em>rendang</em> you guys were eating?”</p>\n<p>“<em>Cough, cough,</em>” hiding the opened wrapping banana leaves, Shira awkwardly trying to make an excuse, “I think Malikh Family is too eager to cut off relationships with our Yashura Family so… I reckon they don’t need this anymore…”</p>\n<p>Mila was so angry she slapped the banana leaves in Shira’s hand.</p>\n<p>“Ah, my rendang…”</p>\n<p>“Your rendang?! You goddamn moron!” Mila hissed, she didn’t dare to roar and announce themselves to other guests. “You’re about to get cuckolded and all you think about is a goddamn rendang?!”</p>\n<p>“Young master, someone trying to get you cuckolded?” licking his fingers for some leftover rendang sauce, Snake asked from the side.</p>\n<p>Shira shook his head. “Cuckold is a very strong word. That girl didn’t even consider me from the beginning. It’s not like we're a married couple yet.”</p>\n<p>He then came to pick the spoiled beef and mourned, “ah… my poor rendang.”</p>\n<p>“Stop crying over that shit! It’s not important!”</p>\n<p>Monkey blurted, “Rendang is not important?”</p>\n<p>Mila glared at Monkey. The monkey-faced peddler closed his mouth as soon as he opened it.</p>\n<p>Romana saw her friend Mila had a bad affinity with her cousin whenever she was angry, thus came to explain from the side, “Young Master Shira, don’t you know people outside the Mossack culture do take engagement seriously? It’s understandable for a young heir of a conservative family like Yashura to not care much about it--but, whatever your feelings regarding your engagement is, if Young Lady Bhela has an affair outside, she’ll also drag down Yashura Family’s reputation. So please be mindful about it more for the sake of your family.”</p>\n<p>They didn’t really think about this deeply since straightforward Mossack people were the type to have children before they were even married. If things went awry, Shira reckoned his uncle and the elders in his family might think the engagement matter was similar to puppy love, about children bantering, but the young generation who was exposed to stories and gossips from books and travellers might think about it differently. And someone who didn’t hang out so much like Shira wouldn’t be able to tell how these youngsters would talk about this incident in the future.</p>\n<p>So Shira stood up and patted his trouser, admitted, “Ah, you’re right, Romana.”</p>\n<p>Mila crossed her arms. Frowning at her cousin. “What are you gonna do now? Fight them? No need to be afraid, I’m with you.”</p>\n<p>Snake, still squatting comfortably, added, “Young Master, my grandfather and my older brother are still here too. You won’t be at a disadvantage in case things go downhill.”</p>\n<p>“It’s decided. Let’s kick their asses!” Mila growled.</p>\n<p>“The heck are you talking about kicking people’s asses in Ngajen Ceremony?” Shira grunted.</p>\n<p>“Then at least let me slap that slut’s arrogant face!”</p>\n<p>Shira shook his head.</p>\n<p>“Let’s go,” he said.</p>\n<p>“We’re gonna slap her face now?” Mila asked.</p>\n<p>“No. We at least have to make Family Yashura’s presence known here,” Shira said. He caught his companions’ confused expressions, so he added, “Everyone is getting excited because most of them are young'uns. But if this incident gets out of the hands, the elders from other families won’t be silent about it.”</p>\n<p>Mila wanted to say something but didn’t after seeing Shira’s relaxed face. She didn’t want to say something silly that’d change the boy’s mind. Therefore, with Shira leading the way, she and her friend Romana went to see the ruckus caused by the noble’s arrival. Leaving Monkey and Sneak who were silent looking at their back.</p>\n<p>The two exchanged glances.</p>\n<p>They looked down, eyes sweeping the ground.</p>\n<p>“Mm?” Monkey mumbled, his hands crawling all over the dirt.</p>\n<p>Snake took out a magic wand. The wand shimmered with a gentle light, then he used that to give some light to the ground where the rendang was spoiled.</p>\n<p>But it was Monkey who shouted in joy, “I got one!”</p>\n<p>“Give me that!” Snake pounced the moment he saw Monkey rubbed the dirt of a piece of rendang.</p>\n<p>Pushing out Snake’s face from grabbing the rendang in his hand, Monkey felt wronged and cried, “Why would a rich gentleman like you fight over a single beef with this poor peddler? Don’t you know my family can only afford to eat beef once a year?”</p>\n<p>“Why, you asked?” Snake sneered, “There’s no need to say the obvious. You don’t get to eat Patriarch Shuro’s handmade rendang everyday! And I’m saying this after starving for beef ever since I’m following you.”</p>\n<p>“Fuck off!”</p>\n<p>“Give me that!”</p>\n<p>“No!”</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the shadowy corner where they were wrestling came to be lightened up with a lit torch.</p>\n<p>“Ehem, you two gentlemen,” a voice called.</p>\n<p>For a moment, Monkey and Snake stopped fighting.</p>\n<p>The voice owner was a man with Malikh Family’s servant uniform. Reluctantly, he continued, “Badril Village locals are usually open-minded and tolerant people. However, we have a bottom line. If you two couldn’t hold it you should rent some inn room or do it in the bushes! Don’t do it in the open, you’re making people uncomfortable! Know some shame!”</p>\n<p>Monkey at first didn’t get what the servant was talking about. Then he realized during infighting over the rendang, he had opened his legs, and Snake was on top of him in a very, very awkward manner.</p>\n<p>“Dammit!” he kicked Snake and trembling over the horror he caught himself in. But suddenly he noticed the rendang in his hand already vanished. He whirled his head around. Snake was already licking his fingers with a satisfied face.</p>\n<p>“Dammit!” Monkey howled again.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The one who enthusiastically greeted the young noble of Blackwood Family was Elder Jhamil instead of Bhela Malikh. He managed to conjure thirty years worth of bullshitting skills to flatter and fawn over the other party, rather thick faced to continue despite the young master of noble family rolled his eyes several times. As soon as the young noble caught the sight of a short-haired girl he immediately escaped from Elder Jhamil’s clutch with a big grin on his face.</p>\n<p>“Ah, Sister Bhela!”</p>\n<p>“Young Master Frane Blackwood.”</p>\n<p>“How are you doing Young Lady Bhela? Fancy to meet you again,” he said as he gifted the girl a flower.</p>\n<p>Bhela received the flower but then immediately passed it to a random maidservant beside her. She said as if it was nothing, “I’m fine. Thank you.”</p>\n<p>Young Master Frane Blackwood smiled wryly. “I’ve been travelling with hardly any rest so that I can see you sooner, my young lady,” the young master of Blackwood Family, Frane Blackwood, said, “may I be so lucky to receive your company tonight?”</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry, but here the words ‘tonight’s companion’ have different meanings than when you say it in the western-style ball--so, no, Young Master Blackwood, I can’t give you company tonight,” she said.</p>\n<p>The young noble still had a smile and wanted to correct his wording, but Bhela suddenly raised her hand and said, “Excuse me.”</p>\n<p>She went past him and greeted another pair of guests instead.</p>\n<p>“Greeting, sir, madam.”</p>\n<p>“It’s about time,” the middle-aged man didn’t answer Bhela’s greeting, but complained instead. “You know the other families had begun their ceremonies, right? Even though we don’t have the same ceremony as your Ngajen Ceremony from the place where I come from, but I know those who don’t take any old ceremonies seriously only brought bad luck over their lands.”</p>\n<p>There was a rare restraint in Bhela’s voice as she replied, “I apologize for our bad conduct, Sir Instructor. I will request the elders to proceed with the ceremony. Please let me lead you toward the reserved spot I previously prepared for both of you.”</p>\n<p>“Lead the way then.”</p>\n<p>Badril Village locals witnessed the valiant Young Lady of Malikh Family taking charge of the Ngajen Ceremony as the Chief Chef, but with the appearance of her bowing to two unfamiliar guests as well, whispers were floating amongst the Ngajen Ceremony guests. Before long, everyone knew that two guests Bhela Malikh greeted were the ones she personally invited, but was neglected before the family’s gate because of the excitement made by the noble’s arrival. Bhela came to them to apologize in person.</p>\n<p>Young Master Frane Blackwood, who felt ignored, pulled a self-decrepitating sneer. He complained to Elder Jhamil instead, “Oh, Malikh Family elder, can you tell me the identity of those two guests who made even Young Lady Bhela to bow her head?”</p>\n<p>“Ehem, ehem,” Elder Jhamil didn’t know what to answer, so he concocted a reply out of thin air, “I think they were relatives from her maternal family.”</p>\n<p>“Is that so? From the way they are dressed, they don’t look from that respectable background enough to get the young lady’s full attention. Don’t you think so?”</p>\n<p>“Young noble is right. Young Lady Bhela’s father once was a gangster thus he didn’t manage to teach common sense to the young lady. I’ll talk to her later to explain what’s really important.”</p>\n<p>After a bit of excuse and fawning, Young Master Blackwood felt this Elder Jhamil was acceptable. He told the Blackwood Family’s servants to bring the gifts he had prepared, which were naturally accepted by Elder Jhamil on the young lady’s behalf. In the meantime, people were disappointed that the drama they were expecting didn’t happen. But what could they do besides shaking their heads and disperse?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Year after year, the ngajen ceremony evolved from stiff sessions of praying ceremony for village safety to the new stylish festivities of foods and happy times for the youngsters, where fads and trends emerge. However big their way of life was changing the conservative major families, Yashura and Elzhier, still pretty much followed the old ways, especially when it came to the prayers. Only Malikh Family amongst the three that eager to embrace the new world that was coming. And by Elder Jhamil’s direction, instead of local shamans, Malikh Family asked help from foreign priests from western orthodox temples from nearby villages to lead the prayer.</p>\n<p>It was all good if one made a progressive decision with the greater good in mind. But here was the problem; orthodox temple priests usually led prayers for abundant harvest, while Ngajen Ceremony was all about calming Selaqs from descending the mountain. These priests probably hadn’t any clue how Selaqs looked like.</p>\n<p>“It was inappropriate for a noble to pray to old Mossack deities they don’t believe in, that was Malikhs’ excuses,'' Mila complained non-stop since they finished praying with other guests. In her hands--like a young mother hugging her baby--were plates of food she had just plundered from Malikh Family’s banquet tables prepared to entertain guests.</p>\n<p>“What deity? Wasn’t the mantra replaced from ancient Mossack prayers to magic spell mantra to calm down Selaq since… I don’t know, fifty years ago?” Romana said. The food in her hands was no less than Mila’s. These two girls seemed to think Malikh Family would regret offending them if they plunder the latter’s prepared feast like no tomorrow.</p>\n<p>“That's what I was saying! We no longer those ancient Mossacks who would sacrifice relatives so Selaqs won’t come down the mountain! Nowadays we’ve been using legit spells to keep all those Selaqs away, and these stupid Malikhs want to change the tradition just to appease some visiting noble? They’d rather avoid their noble guest to be uncomfortable than preventing Selaqs from coming down to chew their stupid brains, hah!”</p>\n<p>Compared to noisy girls beside him, Shira was able to keep his head to his feet. Romana signaled Mila with her eyes when she realized the boy wasn’t so into retaliating against the Malikhs; instead of invading the feast Shira, grabbed Malikh Family’s snacks moderately whenever he could--just like any other normal guests that came here.</p>\n<p>Mila grumbled with a bad mood, faced Shira and said, “Don’t you have something you need to do?”</p>\n<p>“Like what?” Shira hoped this cheeky cousin of his wouldn’t say something about kicking people’s asses again.</p>\n<p>“We can’t wait for something to happen,” she said. “Go ask that bitc--I mean, that fiancée of yours--go ask for a dance. The young’uns are starting to get heated. Look there, one of them couples are dancing. You go join them since that short-haired cunt is your fiancée after all.”</p>\n<p>Mila glanced around for a while before she realized she just had her tongue slipped. She quickly corrected her previous words, “Did I say cunt? I mean short-haired bitch--no, short-haired <em>young lady</em>.”</p>\n<p>“Why don’t you just be honest with yourself here. People have been calling Malikhs much worse here because the foreign priests matter!” Romana laughed.</p>\n<p>At that moment a very young maidservant of Malikh Family just passed by and overheard their conversation. The little maidservant snorted in anger, which made Mila snorted back as a retort.</p>\n<p>“Go, go! Go dance with her!” Mila whispered when she was sure only Shira and Romana were around.</p>\n<p>Shira clicked his tongue. “I don’t even have a single proper conversation with her these past ten years. Why should I go ask her dance out of the blue? Just showing our face around here is enough.”</p>\n<p>“Fool! If she accepted to dance with you then all is good, that would only confirm Malikh Family’s cocky attitude is only because their dipshit brains are getting fried by their own inflated proud ego, nothing serious! But if she ignores you in front of others… heh--she dares!”</p>\n<p>“That’s easy for you to say. If someone you don’t like suddenly asks your hands for a dance, what would you feel later on when you found out refusing means two families become enemies?”</p>\n<p>“Uh-uh, I don’t feel nothing. If he’s my fiancé then it’s my job to go my way out to make it clear in public! Going dancing, going kissing, like a proper damned couple! That’s what the goddamn engagement is all about! Right?”</p>\n<p>Mila ate a cookie and she blinked. Unsure of the previous words she said, she glanced at Romana and murmured, “...right?”</p>\n<p>Romana shrugged.</p>\n<p>But Shira wouldn’t back down easily. He continued arguing, “What if your fiancé is Bony Elzhier, then? Are you going to kiss him to prove he’s your fiancé?”</p>\n<p>Mila hid her gasp.</p>\n<p>“You wanna die?” she pursed her lips. “Listen to me or I’m gonna smack your face!”</p>\n<p>Shira groaned against his cousin’s unreasonableness. But before he could concoct a satisfying retort, Snake and Monkey came out of nowhere.</p>\n<p>“Oh, Young Master Shira,” Monkey came patting him on the shoulder, “it seems you get cuckolded for real this time.”</p>\n<p>People were clapping and whistling as the flashy Young Master Frane Blackwood led Young Lady Bhela Malikh by the hand.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Malikh was entertaining two guests previously, but that bald elder raised a fuss about how she neglected the young noble, so in the end it came to this.”</p>\n<p>Monkey laughed as he teased Shira with his elbow, “They’re going to dance. When two people were dancing in Ngajen Ceremony, that meant they--” he caught the scary experssion on Mila’s face, stopped, “nevermind…”</p>\n<p>“That slut!” Mila hissed.</p>\n<p>This was getting serious. Whenever Mila showed that kind of face something bad would happen. Again, the moment Shira opened his mouth to say something, someone else came to grab him in the shoulder.</p>\n<p>“Brat, your woman is going to cuckold you in public,” said the newcomer, Good-Natured Spirit, who literally came out of the thin air.</p>\n<p>“You too?”</p>\n<p>Shira had a headache. Both Monkey and Snake couldn’t see the annoying Good-Natured Spirit, but the three of them were in harmony in mocking him. They mocked him to the point saying he wouldn’t care would only embarrass him further.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, being led by the hand, Bhela Malikh asked Young Master Blackwood, “What kind of remedy Blackwood Family brought with you?”</p>\n<p>“Why so much in hurry, my young lady?” the young noble gave a laugh and a flash of smile. “No need to worry, Blackwood Family sympathize with the disaster that befell your father, so my mother send me here to personally deliver the medicine Blackwood House had sought far and wide.”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh said nothing more. The Young Master of Blackwood Family pondered as he read the cold expression of the girl, thinking that even with flowers and jewelry gifts, nothing could move this young lady. Such a waste of that beautiful face to not letting a single smile escaped, Young Master Blackwood could only smacked his lips and shook his head. But as soon as he mentioned a medicine he brought for her father, the feisty young lady became amiable almost immediately.</p>\n<p>Good thing for him. Bhela Malikh was talented, the Blackwood Family planned to have her inside their house, and if things went this smoothly he could do that his mother told him sooner than he expected.</p>\n<p>“Little bitch of Malikh Family,” a girl roared, “you finally show your true color you bitch! Is Yashura Family a joke to you?!”</p>\n<p>The furious Mila Yashura became the center of attention. She snorted as she strode, like an angry bull preparing to charge, with the mood that would make the crowd wordlessly give way to her. Not only because they didn’t want anything to do with the infamous young lady of Yashura Family--who, when angry, once punched Bony in the face with a nosebleed--but also because she got a sword in her hands.</p>\n<p>Shira glanced down. His father’s sword he brought with him was gone. He looked again at the unsheated weapon in his cousin’s hands.</p>\n<p>He could only slap his own face the moment he noticed what was happened.</p>\n<p>Mila took a step forward slowly, but her face turned even fiercer. She spoke, “You got guts to bring a lover from outside, eh? I knew something fishy happened when I saw you cut your hair, you little slut.”</p>\n<p>“I cut my hair because it got in the way during my training,” Bhela replied plainly. “And this is not my lover. Just a relative of my friend.”</p>\n<p>“You lying little slut. As if someone like you have any friends!”</p>\n<p>“I do have a friend.” Bhela said. A rare emphasizing tone in her voice was telling that she was upset, but she held back from explaining further.</p>\n<p>“I don’t care what your excuse is! Do you think I don’t know what you shitty Malikhs up to? You already don’t put Yashura Family in your eyes, eh? Just because you bitch have a little vacation outside, eh? If you think you’re a big shot, why don’t you prove it here and now?!”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh was silent for a while. Looking at Mila, she then asked, “And what are you suggesting I should do, Young Lady Yashura?”</p>\n<p>Mila stabbed her sword into the ground.</p>\n<p>“I just want to know how awesome is this Archer class you’ve got overseas that makes you Malikhs stop putting us Yashuras in your eyes,” Mila sneered. “Why don’t we test it with my sword, eh? Let’s do a duel, bitch.”</p>\n<p>Bhela just looked at Mila strangely.</p>\n<p>“But you’re a Specialist class,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Aha! Getting scared, aren’t ya, you little cunt?”</p>\n<p>Bhela didn’t want to argue with her. So she told the nearest servant to go grab a bow.</p>\n<p>On the other side, Monkey anxiously elbowed Shira, said, “Should I drag your cousin back?”</p>\n<p>“Stand down, mister. Mila is the one who’s starting it. She can’t afford to back down now.”</p>\n<p>Beside them Snake was nodding as he understood what Shira meant.</p>\n<p>Then with a laugh, Good-Natured Spirit, who was already tired jeering him, said to Shira. “Kid, shit just got real. Ain’t that a good idea to pull her before it’s too late?”</p>\n<p>Shira wanted to but he couldn’t. He knew exactly Mila’s strength. Fighting bare hands, she might get a chance to stand against the strongest youngster in the village, but it would become a different story when weapons and mana were involved.</p>\n<p>Since Mila was the one to propose the duel, bailing out before the fight began would be slapping her own face in front of the guests. It was a bad idea, because Mila didn’t appear to have the slightest chance to win. So bad that it’d be more reasonable to just surrender. But Shira knew Mila hated to go back on her words the most. Thus he silently moved closer to her, prepared to pull her back in before the situation really got out of his hands.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Young Master Blackwood, was pulled out by an adjutant of his family.</p>\n<p>Smirking, he asked the adjutant, “Who is that girl who picking a fight with Bhela?”</p>\n<p>“Seems like the eldest young lady of that family,” the adjutant replied.</p>\n<p>“You mean the family my Bhela got engaged to?” Young Master Frane Blackwood asked as if Bhela already his. The corner of his lips curled as he thought this might be a good chance to do something on the engagement that Blackwood House already saw as a thorn in their eyes. “Do you have something on that girl?”</p>\n<p>“Replying to young master, since Yashura Family is the main obstacle for us to get Young Lady Bhela Malikh to our side, your mother has already sent someone to investigate them. The eldest young lady of Yashura Family merely a Level 10 Specialist class who just graduated from Novice about seven months ago.”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood couldn’t help but chuckle. Even though the two young ladies had the same level, a Specialist merely support class that wasn’t suited in combat. This duel affair would turn out to be a joke.</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood scoffed. “Let my Bhela teach her some manners. I don’t want anyone to disturb us after this.”</p>\n<p>“Young master,” the adjutant lowered his voice, “I don’t think that’s a good idea.”</p>\n<p>“What’s on your mind, adjutant?”</p>\n<p>“I just made a round to check the guests attending this ceremony, and I found…”--he lowered his voice--“...some spectators amongst the guests that shouldn’t have be here….”</p>\n<p>“Go on,” the young noble urged.</p>\n<p>“I just received the word, young master, there are experts that Elder Jhamil said he didn’t invite.”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood frowned. “What… what’s that supposed to mean?”</p>\n<p>On the less crowded place of the courtyard, the middle-aged man who Bhela greeted before, along with the middle-aged woman, watched the commotion unfold while nibbling on steamed peanuts. He glanced at the other place where a man calmly sipping tea, a man with a hard face who couldn’t hide his sharp aura, then swept his gaze at the one who beside him, a short stature man who wore a headband to hide his reddish hair from public, who also happened to enjoy steamed peanuts while his focus solely at one direction in the crowd.</p>\n<p>All of them came in common garments incognito. But still Elder Jhamil sent people to keep tabs on them, especially since the bald elder still didn’t know the reason Bhela Malikh invited these foreigners.</p>\n<p>The ngajen ceremony usually consisted of three main parts--prayer, socializing, and sending offerings to the mountain as the finale. It was uncommon for irrelevant events to happen between them. However, since the young lady of the host had already accepted the duel, Malikh Family set up an emergency venue for the fight.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil came to invite himself as the judge. For a change to hummiliate those simple Yashuras and to slip himself onto the spotlight, he couldn’t ask for better opportunity.</p>\n<p>“You two ready?” Elder Jhamil asked both of the opposing sides. “This is a friendly match between two friendly families. So stop before your blade hit your enemy,” he said, seemingly talking to either sides, but didn’t say anything about the arrows part.</p>\n<p>Since Bhela Malikh was an Archer, she suggested to Mila, “I’m using a bow. So you can move first. I’ll try to dodge for ten seconds.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t need that,” Mila scoffed.</p>\n<p>“Very well…” she said. She glanced at Elder Jhamil, said, “Elder Jhamil, please begin the duel.&quot;</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil counted to three.</p>\n<p>The duel began.</p>\n<p>“AAAAAA!!!” Mila roared with the sword raised above her head, charging ahead.</p>\n<p>Contrast to her opponent’s battle cry, Bhela was solemn. She picked four arrows from the quiver tied on her hips. Nocking the arrows simultaneously, she took a deep breath as she concentrated to channel different natures elemental mana from her manasphere. The mana, through fingers and her thumb, flowing into all the four arrows and soon the tip of the arrows glowed with four different colors.</p>\n<p>The wind began to stir.</p>\n<p>And she raised the bow. She released the arrows.</p>\n<p><em>Fuuush fuuuushhh fuuushh shhuuuuusshh!</em></p>\n<p>Before even everyone noticed what happened, the mana Bhela channeled melted the flying arrows, within a span of milliseconds, turning them into dangerous magic projectiles of four elemental natures--fire, water, wind and lightning.</p>\n<p>Mila was confident before. She knew a trick against an Archer, but here she was dumbfounded by magic arrows coming to blast her way. She thought she was fighting an Archer, but got up against a Mage instead. This wasn’t what she signed up for.</p>\n<p><em>Clank!</em></p>\n<p>The first blue arrow dissapeared almost the moment it reached Mila. The sound of metallic clash that followed the said arrow resounded three more times, and the three arrows left behind too disappeared almost immediately. Mila, thought she ought to dodge the magic arrows, leap a step backward, but her hasty movement combined with the slippery mud made her slipped her foothold, accidentally fell to her butt instead.</p>\n<p>Bhela aimed down her bow. Everyone was staring at her with complicated and questioning gaze, as an Archer who could do magic, this was the first time everyone witnessed it.</p>\n<p>“It’s a four elemental affinity spell!” someone’s voice roared through the silenced venue, “I heard it, I doubted it, but she really did it!”</p>\n<p>Everyone looked at his way, the man who shouted, and saw that it was the middle-aged man whom Bhela invited from outside the village. He sat eating steamed peanuts then, now he was standing perplexed.</p>\n<p>Bhela, realizing that the man was the center of the attention, and bow to him from afar.</p>\n<p>“She really did it…” the man said under his breath.</p>\n<p>Someone who sat beside him said, “Sure she did, the only one right now--I guess now that you big brain from Elemental Stone School witnessed it I guess you can die without regret?”</p>\n<p>The man looked at the woman who accompanied him, he said still with expression of disbelieve, “It’s a four elemental affinity spell…”</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, you already said that.”</p>\n<p>The last and the most famous multi elemental Unique Class was, a mage with three elemental affinity skills, died of old age--was actually the headmaster of Elemental Stone School from seventy years ago. As a scholar and a mage researching deeply in topics of elemental mana all of his career, how could he didn’t know the value of a Unique Class who surpassed even the ex-headmaster of his school?</p>\n<p>“I can’t believe someone without a Mage Unique Class really did it…”</p>\n<p>“The most promising talent of this generation, alright, the first time I witnessed an Archer could do magic,” the woman said. “Good thing she stopped her arrows then--if not, the other girl would ended up so pitiful.”</p>\n<p>As the woman said that, someone else blurted not far away from there.</p>\n<p>“She didn’t stop it.”</p>\n<p>“Pardon? Sir Kurusiya?” the woman asked.</p>\n<p>The one she was talking to was the quiet man with sharp aura. He said as a matter of fact like tone, “She didn’t stop it. Someone else did,” he sipped his tea, and when the woman still confused, he explained with hoarse voice, “those are magic, but they were still arrows shot from a bow. You can’t stop flying arrows. That girl calculated and slightly missed her aim as to not hurting her opponent. But she didn’t plan to stop it.”</p>\n<p>The woman questioned him, “If she wasn’t the one who stopped it, then would you know why the arrows disappears?”</p>\n<p>The man put down his glass of tea. “I don’t know. Why you ask me? Ask that fool there who’s been grinning all the time.”</p>\n<p>The woman, along with the middle-aged man from Stone Elemental School, looked up to the bearded foreigner.</p>\n<p>“She’s not the one who stopped it,” the bearded man said with a smile.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Mila, who mellowed from her defeat and still sat on the muddy ground, gulped as she saw her cousin come to pick her up.</p>\n<p>“I lost,” she said to Shira.</p>\n<p>“No you didn’t, that girl is the one who put down her bow first, and you still got your swords in your hands--so technically you’d win.”</p>\n<p>“I fell to my butt, I was humiliated,” Mila said, her voice trembled, “I lost….”</p>\n<p>Shira sighed. He grabbed Mila’s hand and pulled her up. “It’s adult problems from hereon, Uncle Shuro would likely summon my father back. For now, let’s get out of here,” he said.</p>\n<p>Monkey and Snake, along with the nervous Romana, came to follow them from behind to shield them from people’s laughter. Mila was so humiliated the usually feisty tomboy was so down she couldn’t afford to hold her head straight. As Shira witnessed how pitiful his cousin was, regret overwhelming him when he remembered how he was holding back from taking action himself.</p>\n<p>“Brat,” someone called him.</p>\n<p>Shira turned his head. It was Good-Natured Spirit.</p>\n<p>“You owe me this time,” the Nalaq said.</p>\n<p>Shira nodded.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>“Hear ye hear ye people! Gather around and hear me announce something incredible, people! Gather around, will ya!”</p>\n<p>Standing on top of a table, Elder Jhamil shouted to gather people, announcing something that the Young Master of Blackwood Family passed him beforehands. “Although winner of the duel is Young Lady Bhela, Young Master Frane of Blackwood House is concerned by some stupid unruly girl of the supposed biggest family in Badril Village behavior would smear my young lady--”</p>\n<p>“Big news! Big news!” someone else’s shouting cut off Elder Jhamil’s announcement, “Young Master Bonithon is running around beating people! Watch your mouth if you don’t want get beaten for no reason!”</p>\n<p>“Bony is going crazy! He’s going to kick people’s asses! Nobody knows why!”</p>\n<p>“What the fuck is going on! Why Elzhier Family messing with us Malikhs now?”</p>\n<p>At the chaotic scene before him, Elder Jhamil’s face showed a frown and a hint of hesitation. He then cleared his phlegm anyway, trying to get people’s attention, then pushed on announcing carefully, “Young Master Frane Blackwood is concerned that--”</p>\n<p>“Elder Jhamil!!” a servant came running with a horrified expression, “Bony is coming for you, run away!”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil pointed his finger at the servant and roared, “What is that brat from Elzhier Family wants to do with me! Go kick him out, I’m trying to tell everybody something important here!”</p>\n<p>“But he doesn’t listen to reasons! He’s going to punch your face, is what he said just now!”</p>\n<p>“Imbecile! Do you think a young master would jump around like a monkey and punch an elder of another family in the damn face?! He’s making ruckus. Go on, kick him out!”</p>\n<p>Looking at the crowd from the rushedly made stage, he then smiled and continued, “Right, everybody, it’s Young Master of Blackwood Family; what I’m saying is that since Young Lady Bhela Malikh is winning with ease against the foolish young lady of <em>that</em> family, Young Master Blackwood concerned that some people would shrug my young lady’s victory. So he proposed, in order to make it clear the disparity between Malikh and--sheesh--Yashura, he proposed that him as a friendly representative of Malikh Family and Shira Yashura as the repre--”</p>\n<p>“Elder Jhamil--watch out!”</p>\n<p>He had it taking from lowly servants who cut off his announcement. Fuming in anger, Elder Jhamil pointed his finger toward the one who was spriting toward him and roared, “How many times I told you to just kick him out! Shut your trap and go kick the damned brat!”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was losing his cool. But what he failed to realize in time was that the one who sprinted toward him wasn’t a servant from his family. It was not the one who telling him to run away. And before he knew it, someone leaped up on the table where he was standing and delivered a punch to the face.</p>\n<p>“Gaaahhh!”</p>\n<p>Even after Elder Jhamil stumbled down the table he stood on, his assaulter didn’t plan to let him go. And what came after that was a torrent of hardened fist, pummeling his face even though he screamed for mercy. Only when the chaotic crowd succeeded in saving him did Elder Jhamil see the assaulter’s face--it was indeed the Young Master from Elzhier Family.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Bonithon… what did you… why did you do this… for what reason?!” Elder Jhamil choked out his grievance.</p>\n<p>Bony, the man who beat the bald elder black and blue, replied with nothing but a cold stare. Instead, it was an almost incoherent voice of Pilek who answered instead.</p>\n<p>“Kekekek, don’t be angry Elder Baldy! We just discussed how you were a splendid Pugilist a long time ago, so Boss Bony came here to find out whether it was true or not! That’s why he asked you to a barehand duel!” Pilek came in with a swagger and a bottle of booze in his hand. From a single glance anybody could tell he was drunk.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s lips trembled. What duel? That brat just leaped out of nowhere without saying anything, then immediately beating him black and blue!</p>\n<p>The only one from the three delinquents who hadn’t had the smell of liquor from his body was Polio. He wore an apologetic smile, and with a slight sigh, he said, “Please forgive them, dear kind Malikh sirs, my friends are terrible when they are drunk.”</p>\n<p>Polio made a round to apologize to any Malikhs he saw. But the Malikh Family didn’t appreciate his gesture, receiving jeerings in return.</p>\n<p>Polio was a patient young man, but Pilek wasn’t. The drunk Pilek didn’t take their attitude kindly, randomly walking to a servant, said, “Hah? What the fuck are you staring me at, you no-name Malikh servant? Wanna die, eh? Huuuraah!!!”</p>\n<p><em>Shatter!</em></p>\n<p>Without a warning he swung the booze in his hand to a Malikh family servant. The man he attacked stumbled backward holding his bloodied head from the crash Pilek gave him.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Bhela Malikh had just settled greeting four foreign guests that she invited from outside, and was on her way to fetch cuisines from the kitchen to humor her guests, then she witnessed the chaotic brawl unfold with a crowdful of cheers and jeers mixed in between. Perhaps there were more than a dozen men involved, with the Malikhs servants, guards, common family members even an elder came along to surround Bony and his two underlings.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela…” a little maidservant with a crest of Elzhier Family in her uniform bowed to Bhela politely.</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at her. She returned the bow even though the other party clearly was a servant. “Miss Elzhier,” she spoke softly.</p>\n<p>“No need to be polite to this servant, Young Lady.”</p>\n<p>“I can’t be impolite to Sister Ryntia’s friends.”</p>\n<p>The Elzhier Family maidservant smiled. Since Bhela insisted, then she wouldn’t be bowing her head anymore.</p>\n<p>She said, “Eldest Young Lady sends me to ask for your forgiveness for her brother’s brashness, Young Lady Bhela.”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at the brawl that started in her family’s courtyard. This chaos would spell imperfect on tonight's Malikh Family’s Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>“There’s no need for that. Since I accepted Young Lady Mila Yashura’s duel then I somewhat anticipated Young Master Bonithon will follow suit to make trouble tonight. If anything, it is I the one who should apologize to Sister Ryntia because I couldn’t handle the situation well. Please tell her that I’ll try to maintain friendship between Malikh and Elzhier Family.”</p>\n<p>Still with the serene smile on her face, the Elzhier Family maidservant studied the expression on Bhela’s face. She spoke a moment after, “Then I’ll let Eldest Young Lady Elzhier knows by tomorrow.”</p>\n<p>“Thanks,” Bhela offered her gratitude with a bow.</p>\n<p>By this time, the brawl became anything but intensified, as men either from Elzhier Family or thugs that previously had dealings with Bony’s group came in to reinforce the Elzhier young master. Before the Malikhs could pressure the intruders with numbers, but then the completely overwhelmed by the new reinforcement.</p>\n<p>“Huurraaahh!” Pilek sent a Malikh man flying with his kick. “Where the fuck your previous cocky taunt? Cat got your tongue, eh?”</p>\n<p>The only unspoken rules in brawls were strictly no usage of mana and spell as well as no sharp objects to use as weapons. But when it was chaotic and nobody could watch everybody the sharpest mind with tricks the one who prevailed--this is why the likes of Pilek and his friend Polio who always struck in place people wouldn’t be willing the one who were taking the advantage in brawls. Even hunters and seasoned guards were no match against these naughty brats.</p>\n<p>For example, when Pilek’s punch was blocked by Elder Jhamil’s son, “You shitty brat, just wait till I deal with your father--kuukgghh!”</p>\n<p>And because no one was watching, Pilek used his knee to strike the cocky young elder in the balls.</p>\n<p>With a sad whimper from his trembling lips, Elder Jhamil’s son curled onto the ground holding his precious balls that Polio struck.</p>\n<p>Seeing that a family elder was mercilessly defeated, a few Malikhs came to avenge their young elder. By then, Pilek already had Polio watching over his back.</p>\n<p>At that point, no Malikhs could match them in hand-in-hand brawl.</p>\n<p>A stranger then casually walked in. Pilek stopped, looking at him, and amidst the chaotic scene it took a while for him to find out that the man was actually a foreigner--an eastern Kaya man. The man had a sheathed sword on his hips. But Pilek wasn’t afraid as long as he stick with the brawl rules to use only fighting unarmed.</p>\n<p>“Huurraaah!”</p>\n<p>Pilek threw a feint. Most simple Malikhs would fall for this. But the eastern Kaya man didn’t budge. Seemed to even anticipate it. With a movement too fast for Pilek to follow the man grabbed his wrist, flicked him and sent him into the air like it was nothing.</p>\n<p>It was only after Pilek rolled in the mud he realized what had happened.</p>\n<p>The man then glanced aside and walked toward Polio who in his own right was too engrossed with the brawl. With his left hand pushing Polio’s shoulder and the other hand grabbing his wrist, he flipped Polio just like he did Pilek beforehand.</p>\n<p>Pilek and a few others that the man previously flipped were amazed by how effortlessly the man disabling enthusiastic young men from fighting.</p>\n<p>The sword handle the man had was wrapped with cloth and its body too thin for regular blades. Those who noticed this would understand that the man wasn’t an ordinary Kaya. Polio was one of them.</p>\n<p>“A Samurai!” he exclaimed a moment after he got thrown onto the muddy ground.</p>\n<p>The Kaya man stopped, looking at him, then spoke with a displeased tone, “I am but a masterless ronin.”</p>\n<p>The man then continued walking toward a different direction.</p>\n<p>Bony was fighting with three men alone, so he couldn’t afford to look around. He didn’t realize the Kaya man at first, but when the man tried to grab the wild young master’s wrist, Bony reacted--he reacted by throwing a punch to the man’s face.</p>\n<p>The man slapped his flying fist from the side, tremendously muffled its momentum. Again, he tried to grab Bony’s wrist and his shoulder. Bony tried resisting but the man’s speed was too fast for him to compete.</p>\n<p>As the man prepared to flip him, Bony felt a faint gush of the wind from his legs. It didn’t take him a second to realize the man just putting his hand on his shoulder as a feint--his real target was to gently nudge his foot on rooting from the ground, which, if he’d focus his effort to get his shoulder free from the man’s grasp, a small window of opening that could be used by his opponent to disrupt his sense of balance. Thus Bony firmly stomped his feet to the ground instead. He grabbed the man’s sleeve to make his opponent not be able to easily throw like Pilek and Polio.</p>\n<p>Responding to Bony’s choice, the man curled the corner of his lips. Bony caught a hint of taunt when he staring the man in the eyes.</p>\n<p>“Kkuuuggghh!”</p>\n<p>Bony did succeed in preventing himself get flipped to the ground. But he got struck in the gut instead.</p>\n<p>The man didn’t let him go. The moment Bony stepping backward due to shock having stricken, the man was charging and got his wrist in the blink of the eyes--what happened afterward was Bony got his feet swept and he completely lost his ground, and got cheered by his friends as the last man who got thrown into the mud.</p>\n<p>Bony then sat there looking as the fight stopped; since someone took him down, more and less the Malikhs had won the brawl.</p>\n<p>“Aren’t you Thoqek’s son?” the Kaya man asked Bony.</p>\n<p>Bony wasn’t willing to open his mouth when his father’s name got mentioned.</p>\n<p>Receiving no answer, the man thus carelessly said, “Unexpectedly, you’ve got more guts than your father. Get up now, and stop making trouble in Ghalim Malikh’s home.”</p>\n<p>The young ruffians with Bony as the leader naturally wouldn’t be arrogant anymore since they had been defeated. They retreated calmly, and the Malikhs didn’t dare taunt them the second time in case Bony would change his mind and started on a rampage again. In the end, the real reason why Bony came targeting Malikh Family, as many people knew, was that he wasn’t a drinker that would lose reason to punch another family’s elder in the face.</p>\n<p>Speaking about an elder who got a punch in the face; after Bony and others were gone, Elder Jhamil showed his nose out of his hiding place. He gritted his teeth. He swore he’d use his full resource to get back from Bony’s father in the next village council meeting.</p>\n<p>“Elder Jhamil, you still haven’t announced the thing I ask you to do,” from behind, the sullen young noble Frane Blackwood said to him.</p>\n<p>“Y-young Master Blackwood, please spare me--the mood isn’t that good to draw people’s attention after that kid crashing our Ngajen Ceremony just now. How about I brief it to other village leaders tomorrow in the village council meeting?”</p>\n<p>“No, I want everyone to know it by tonight. This is the right time and the right place to announce it. Besides, I want to see what kind of a young man the one who’s supposed to be my rival.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil didn’t want to show his beaten face to the crowd tonight. But as much as he love his face he knew flattery wouldn’t get him out of this situation--at least not if he didn’t want to offend the young noble. And so with a heavy face he climbed the table once again, hiding off his reluctancy.</p>\n<p>Someone heartily made a joke on him, “Elder Jhamil, we thought you’re a man who care about face the most--I don’t expect you to boldly show how handsome you’ve become now!”</p>\n<p>“Kids nowadays getting big headed by their privileges as young masters--naturally I’ll let their fathers know how to discipline their brats!” Elder Jhamil coldly said. “Anyway, you all know that my Young Lady Bhela is a girl with talent and her future is boundless. Here in Malikh Family we’re not willing to throw our princess to cow’s dunk that is Yashura Family’s trash young master. And our friend Young Noble Frane Blackwood also thinks the same!”</p>\n<p>Such passionate speech, naturally people were cheering in anticipation of the next spectacle they thought they were going to witness.</p>\n<p>Getting the cue from Elder Jhamil, Frane Blackwood came forward with a swagger. “I speak this as a close friend of Young Lady Bhela Malikh. Someone with the name of Shira Yashura; if you think you’re worthy of her, do you dare to prove it by having a duel with me?!”</p>\n<p>The crowd was silent. They were waiting for the reply.</p>\n<p>Frane Blackwood swept the crowd with his eyes.</p>\n<p>Someone said to him the boy he challenged was utter trash. He was amused guessing how this trash would respond to his duel challenge, especially when Bhela Malikh had just completely defeated the cheeky young lady from his family.</p>\n<p>There were already murmurs spreading. People were also curious whether Shira was going to accept or run away from it.</p>\n<p>And then…</p>\n<p>“<em>Cough, cough…</em>” someone awkwardly stepped forward with a wry smile plastered on his face. People recognized his face, which looked like a monkey, and many of them had seen him together with Shira Yashura.</p>\n<p>He was Monkey. He said, “This young noble… about your proposed duel… I’m afraid Young Master Shira Yashura can’t answer it tonight.”</p>\n<p>Frane Blackwood laughed. “Why? He’s scared? His cousin challenged Young Lady Bhela to a duel for no apparent reason; don’t tell me we can do the same to them?”</p>\n<p>“No, it’s not that.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil pointed his finger at Monkey. “We all know Shira Yashura is a trash who can’t even advance to Level 4 Novice! Young Master Frane Blackwood is kind. Tonight, he’s going to give Shira one chance to admit that he’s unworthy of Young Lady Bhela Malikh to the crowd here. He does that, and there will be no need for Young Master Frane Blackwood to embarrass him by kicking his ass!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, but he can’t give you an answer tonight,” Monkey insisted.</p>\n<p>Now it was Elder Jhamil who laughed. “He’s really scared facing Young Master Frane right now?!”</p>\n<p>“No…”</p>\n<p>“Then why?”</p>\n<p>Monkey sighed.</p>\n<p>“Because he’s already gone home!”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was furious. The whole point he had to gather people even though his face had been beaten by Bony was to call out the boy and embarrass him in public, as per the young noble request. But the said person himself already went home, so Elder Jhamil standing on top of the table was for nothing.</p>\n<p>Immediately he ordered a servant to send the message to Yashura Family, while in between, cursing the fact that he didn’t get the chance to distract the guests from discussing the previous brawl. Sure enough, not only the people were talking about Bhela Malikh’s hidden Unique Class, they were also talking about Bony, and people he beat to pulp, especially Elder Jhamil. People no longer cared to gossip about Young Lady Mila Yashura who had been sent home defeated, but they laughed at someone present who had just his misfortune like Elder Jhamil instead.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil had lost his face in the end. Literally and metaphorically.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, with a solemn expression Monkey looked at his partner Snake who was enjoying the banquet and had amused himself watching the spectacle previously.</p>\n<p>Monkey said with a whisper, “Why the hell your family doesn’t show his face when they dumping shit to Young Master and Young Lady Yashura just now?!”</p>\n<p>Snake glanced at him lazily. “I don’t know. They said they were going to diagnose Patriarch Ghalim Malikh previously.”</p>\n<p>“Can’t you just fetch your brother instead? Didn’t you put your words to assure young master before this? What if he thinks we’re people who put our words lightly?”</p>\n<p>“The one who’s diagnosing the patriarch is my grandfather, my brother supposed to be free enough to be a busybody just now,” Snake said, displeased by Monkey’s tone accusing him of being unloyal to his own word.</p>\n<p>Actually, he also confused why his brother didn’t show his nose when Young Lady Mila recklessly brought a sword to challenge Bhela to a duel. From his understanding of his brother’s character and the relationship between his family and Yashura from what he knew told him that more or less his brother was going to back Yashura if the drama with Malikh Family intensified. But he didn’t. Snake would barge into Malikh Family’s doors to look for his grandfather if he knew it was going to be like this instead.</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-2/chapter-4":"<p>Badril Village, though had been two years passed without her presence, was the same as always for Bhela Malikh. She hadn’t that many acquaintances her age she could consider friendly before. In spite of that, from the day she returned, people act as if they were her rekindled childhood friends she never knew she had.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” a daughter of an elder from Elzhier Family asked curiously, “is the rumor about that story true?”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at her with eyelids half-closed.</p>\n<p>“Which rumor?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, silly you, of course <em>that</em> rumor! The one about your romance with a blue blood noble!”</p>\n<p>Giggles of girls followed after the girl’s words. When Bhela returned to Badril Village she brought not only fame and reputation, but interesting stories and rumors as well. She was currently surrounded by curious young ladies who sought for exciting gossip.</p>\n<p>“Yeah, yeah!” another girl excitedly hussing in low voice. “I heard he’ll attend Malikh’s ngajen ceremony tonight!”</p>\n<p>“Really?”</p>\n<p>“Why else would Young Lady Bhela take the Chef Chief position if she didn’t expect for her lover to come tonight? He’ll come for sure!”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, yeah, everybody is saying Young Lady Bhela doing just for that!”</p>\n<p>Bhela found it was amazing how people could conjure their own rumors despite not seeing the true story by their own eyes.</p>\n<p>And just when the young ladies started getting excited discussing Young Lady Bhela’s ‘love life’, a vigorous shout resounded the courtyard announcing that Blackwood Family had arrived.</p>\n<p>“Blackwood Family?” someone cocked their head and looked over the direction of the gate. “What kind of family is so bold announcing their names in other family’s ngajen ceremony? Not even Village Head’s Elzhier Family would do to the ceremony host!”</p>\n<p>“Only foreigners to be that stupid to be rude in big family like Malikh! If this is my place I’d send a guard to kick their ass out as soon as possible!”</p>\n<p>“Look over there! Malikh Family elders are rushing to the gate! Let’s check out how’s Malikhs going to deal with it!”</p>\n<p>Curious guests were tailing the elders to see some commotion they thought would occur. However, not only did the Malikhs not make a fuss over it, they even bowed their heads toward the newly arrived noble as if they were servants greeting their returning master. Young people were overly excited because nobles were foreign and appeared in stories all of their lives.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Mila, who already went back with her friend, was gritting teeth with anger. Beside her Romana was holding the tomboy back, though concerned she didn't say a word.</p>\n<p>“Why should I am the one who always had to hold myself back?” Mila hissed in a low voice as if she was wronged.</p>\n<p>“Look around and think about who’s receiving the blow the most. Everyone’s talking about your cousin right now--do you want to make it worse for him?”</p>\n<p>After hearing her friend’s warning, Mila began to take a deep breath and think things through. Romana was right. When she opened her ears Mila could hear people comparing the young master of this noble Blackwood Family with her cousin Shira. They compared such a gallant-looking young noble with a trash of Yashura Family young master, adding with their own biased seasoning here and there, making her cousin Shira look really bad. Mila trembled as her face boiled red from holding back her anger.</p>\n<p>“Where’s Shira right now?”</p>\n<p>“I think he went hiding!” Romana said.</p>\n<p>“Hiding?! He’s embarrassed to show his face that much?”</p>\n<p>After circling around a bit, Mila found the boy’s silhouette in the shadow far from the braziers' light. There, he was squatting, hiding along with two other silhouettes who were also squatting in a suspicious manner.</p>\n<p>“Now, young master, where the hell did you get this coin?” someone whispered from the suspicious bunch.</p>\n<p>The reply came also in the same hushed manner. “Don’t ask me now, just know I’ve got a few more hidden in my house. I can’t move my family, but if you’re fine with this, I can invest in your goods earlier.”</p>\n<p>“We’re fine? Of course we’re fine! Don’t you know how amazing this coin is?”</p>\n<p>“It’s amazing? I can’t even buy satays with this. Nobody here would receive unfamiliar currency.”</p>\n<p>“But don’t you know how far ahead you can go if merchants know you grab some of these coins?”</p>\n<p>“You tell me.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, these coins weren’t issued by any countries, but they’re valuable. Lots of herbs and ingredients in the black markets can only be bought with these coins...”</p>\n<p><em>...whisper whisper whisper...</em></p>\n<p>Mila approached.</p>\n<p>“Ey, what are you doing?!”</p>\n<p>For some reasons, Shira and Monkey, one of his companions, almost jumped in fright by her barking. Both Mila and Romana behind her saw Shira and Monkey were acting suspicious--but Sneak, the third silhouette, didn’t even try to hide that he was nibbling on something delicious.</p>\n<p>Mila, with a weird face, hissed, “Is that… <em>rendang</em> you guys were eating?”</p>\n<p>“<em>Cough, cough,</em>” hiding the opened wrapping banana leaves, Shira awkwardly trying to make an excuse, “I think Malikh Family is too eager to cut off relationships with our Yashura Family so… I reckon they don’t need this anymore…”</p>\n<p>Mila was so angry she slapped the banana leaves in Shira’s hand.</p>\n<p>“Ah, my rendang…”</p>\n<p>“Your rendang?! You goddamn moron!” Mila hissed, she didn’t dare to roar and announce themselves to other guests. “You’re about to get cuckolded and all you think about is a goddamn rendang?!”</p>\n<p>“Young master, someone trying to get you cuckolded?” licking his fingers for some leftover rendang sauce, Snake asked from the side.</p>\n<p>Shira shook his head. “Cuckold is a very strong word. That girl didn’t even consider me from the beginning. It’s not like we're a married couple yet.”</p>\n<p>He then came to pick the spoiled beef and mourned, “ah… my poor rendang.”</p>\n<p>“Stop crying over that shit! It’s not important!”</p>\n<p>Monkey blurted, “Rendang is not important?”</p>\n<p>Mila glared at Monkey. The monkey-faced peddler closed his mouth as soon as he opened it.</p>\n<p>Romana saw her friend Mila had a bad affinity with her cousin whenever she was angry, thus came to explain from the side, “Young Master Shira, don’t you know people outside the Mossack culture do take engagement seriously? It’s understandable for a young heir of a conservative family like Yashura to not care much about it--but, whatever your feelings regarding your engagement is, if Young Lady Bhela has an affair outside, she’ll also drag down Yashura Family’s reputation. So please be mindful about it more for the sake of your family.”</p>\n<p>They didn’t really think about this deeply since straightforward Mossack people were the type to have children before they were even married. If things went awry, Shira reckoned his uncle and the elders in his family might think the engagement matter was similar to puppy love, about children bantering, but the young generation who was exposed to stories and gossips from books and travellers might think about it differently. And someone who didn’t hang out so much like Shira wouldn’t be able to tell how these youngsters would talk about this incident in the future.</p>\n<p>So Shira stood up and patted his trouser, admitted, “Ah, you’re right, Romana.”</p>\n<p>Mila crossed her arms. Frowning at her cousin. “What are you gonna do now? Fight them? No need to be afraid, I’m with you.”</p>\n<p>Snake, still squatting comfortably, added, “Young Master, my grandfather and my older brother are still here too. You won’t be at a disadvantage in case things go downhill.”</p>\n<p>“It’s decided. Let’s kick their asses!” Mila growled.</p>\n<p>“The heck are you talking about kicking people’s asses in Ngajen Ceremony?” Shira grunted.</p>\n<p>“Then at least let me slap that slut’s arrogant face!”</p>\n<p>Shira shook his head.</p>\n<p>“Let’s go,” he said.</p>\n<p>“We’re gonna slap her face now?” Mila asked.</p>\n<p>“No. We at least have to make Family Yashura’s presence known here,” Shira said. He caught his companions’ confused expressions, so he added, “Everyone is getting excited because most of them are young'uns. But if this incident gets out of the hands, the elders from other families won’t be silent about it.”</p>\n<p>Mila wanted to say something but didn’t after seeing Shira’s relaxed face. She didn’t want to say something silly that’d change the boy’s mind. Therefore, with Shira leading the way, she and her friend Romana went to see the ruckus caused by the noble’s arrival. Leaving Monkey and Sneak who were silent looking at their back.</p>\n<p>The two exchanged glances.</p>\n<p>They looked down, eyes sweeping the ground.</p>\n<p>“Mm?” Monkey mumbled, his hands crawling all over the dirt.</p>\n<p>Snake took out a magic wand. The wand shimmered with a gentle light, then he used that to give some light to the ground where the rendang was spoiled.</p>\n<p>But it was Monkey who shouted in joy, “I got one!”</p>\n<p>“Give me that!” Snake pounced the moment he saw Monkey rubbed the dirt of a piece of rendang.</p>\n<p>Pushing out Snake’s face from grabbing the rendang in his hand, Monkey felt wronged and cried, “Why would a rich gentleman like you fight over a single beef with this poor peddler? Don’t you know my family can only afford to eat beef once a year?”</p>\n<p>“Why, you asked?” Snake sneered, “There’s no need to say the obvious. You don’t get to eat Patriarch Shuro’s handmade rendang everyday! And I’m saying this after starving for beef ever since I’m following you.”</p>\n<p>“Fuck off!”</p>\n<p>“Give me that!”</p>\n<p>“No!”</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the shadowy corner where they were wrestling came to be lightened up with a lit torch.</p>\n<p>“Ehem, you two gentlemen,” a voice called.</p>\n<p>For a moment, Monkey and Snake stopped fighting.</p>\n<p>The voice owner was a man with Malikh Family’s servant uniform. Reluctantly, he continued, “Badril Village locals are usually open-minded and tolerant people. However, we have a bottom line. If you two couldn’t hold it you should rent some inn room or do it in the bushes! Don’t do it in the open, you’re making people uncomfortable! Know some shame!”</p>\n<p>Monkey at first didn’t get what the servant was talking about. Then he realized during infighting over the rendang, he had opened his legs, and Snake was on top of him in a very, very awkward manner.</p>\n<p>“Dammit!” he kicked Snake and trembling over the horror he caught himself in. But suddenly he noticed the rendang in his hand already vanished. He whirled his head around. Snake was already licking his fingers with a satisfied face.</p>\n<p>“Dammit!” Monkey howled again.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The one who enthusiastically greeted the young noble of Blackwood Family was Elder Jhamil instead of Bhela Malikh. He managed to conjure thirty years worth of bullshitting skills to flatter and fawn over the other party, rather thick faced to continue despite the young master of noble family rolled his eyes several times. As soon as the young noble caught the sight of a short-haired girl he immediately escaped from Elder Jhamil’s clutch with a big grin on his face.</p>\n<p>“Ah, Sister Bhela!”</p>\n<p>“Young Master Frane Blackwood.”</p>\n<p>“How are you doing Young Lady Bhela? Fancy to meet you again,” he said as he gifted the girl a flower.</p>\n<p>Bhela received the flower but then immediately passed it to a random maidservant beside her. She said as if it was nothing, “I’m fine. Thank you.”</p>\n<p>Young Master Frane Blackwood smiled wryly. “I’ve been travelling with hardly any rest so that I can see you sooner, my young lady,” the young master of Blackwood Family, Frane Blackwood, said, “may I be so lucky to receive your company tonight?”</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry, but here the words ‘tonight’s companion’ have different meanings than when you say it in the western-style ball--so, no, Young Master Blackwood, I can’t give you company tonight,” she said.</p>\n<p>The young noble still had a smile and wanted to correct his wording, but Bhela suddenly raised her hand and said, “Excuse me.”</p>\n<p>She went past him and greeted another pair of guests instead.</p>\n<p>“Greeting, sir, madam.”</p>\n<p>“It’s about time,” the middle-aged man didn’t answer Bhela’s greeting, but complained instead. “You know the other families had begun their ceremonies, right? Even though we don’t have the same ceremony as your Ngajen Ceremony from the place where I come from, but I know those who don’t take any old ceremonies seriously only brought bad luck over their lands.”</p>\n<p>There was a rare restraint in Bhela’s voice as she replied, “I apologize for our bad conduct, Sir Instructor. I will request the elders to proceed with the ceremony. Please let me lead you toward the reserved spot I previously prepared for both of you.”</p>\n<p>“Lead the way then.”</p>\n<p>Badril Village locals witnessed the valiant Young Lady of Malikh Family taking charge of the Ngajen Ceremony as the Chief Chef, but with the appearance of her bowing to two unfamiliar guests as well, whispers were floating amongst the Ngajen Ceremony guests. Before long, everyone knew that two guests Bhela Malikh greeted were the ones she personally invited, but was neglected before the family’s gate because of the excitement made by the noble’s arrival. Bhela came to them to apologize in person.</p>\n<p>Young Master Frane Blackwood, who felt ignored, pulled a self-decrepitating sneer. He complained to Elder Jhamil instead, “Oh, Malikh Family elder, can you tell me the identity of those two guests who made even Young Lady Bhela to bow her head?”</p>\n<p>“Ehem, ehem,” Elder Jhamil didn’t know what to answer, so he concocted a reply out of thin air, “I think they were relatives from her maternal family.”</p>\n<p>“Is that so? From the way they are dressed, they don’t look from that respectable background enough to get the young lady’s full attention. Don’t you think so?”</p>\n<p>“Young noble is right. Young Lady Bhela’s father once was a gangster thus he didn’t manage to teach common sense to the young lady. I’ll talk to her later to explain what’s really important.”</p>\n<p>After a bit of excuse and fawning, Young Master Blackwood felt this Elder Jhamil was acceptable. He told the Blackwood Family’s servants to bring the gifts he had prepared, which were naturally accepted by Elder Jhamil on the young lady’s behalf. In the meantime, people were disappointed that the drama they were expecting didn’t happen. But what could they do besides shaking their heads and disperse?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Year after year, the ngajen ceremony evolved from stiff sessions of praying ceremony for village safety to the new stylish festivities of foods and happy times for the youngsters, where fads and trends emerge. However big their way of life was changing the conservative major families, Yashura and Elzhier, still pretty much followed the old ways, especially when it came to the prayers. Only Malikh Family amongst the three that eager to embrace the new world that was coming. And by Elder Jhamil’s direction, instead of local shamans, Malikh Family asked help from foreign priests from western orthodox temples from nearby villages to lead the prayer.</p>\n<p>It was all good if one made a progressive decision with the greater good in mind. But here was the problem; orthodox temple priests usually led prayers for abundant harvest, while Ngajen Ceremony was all about calming Selaqs from descending the mountain. These priests probably hadn’t any clue how Selaqs looked like.</p>\n<p>“It was inappropriate for a noble to pray to old Mossack deities they don’t believe in, that was Malikhs’ excuses,'' Mila complained non-stop since they finished praying with other guests. In her hands--like a young mother hugging her baby--were plates of food she had just plundered from Malikh Family’s banquet tables prepared to entertain guests.</p>\n<p>“What deity? Wasn’t the mantra replaced from ancient Mossack prayers to magic spell mantra to calm down Selaq since… I don’t know, fifty years ago?” Romana said. The food in her hands was no less than Mila’s. These two girls seemed to think Malikh Family would regret offending them if they plunder the latter’s prepared feast like no tomorrow.</p>\n<p>“That's what I was saying! We no longer those ancient Mossacks who would sacrifice relatives so Selaqs won’t come down the mountain! Nowadays we’ve been using legit spells to keep all those Selaqs away, and these stupid Malikhs want to change the tradition just to appease some visiting noble? They’d rather avoid their noble guest to be uncomfortable than preventing Selaqs from coming down to chew their stupid brains, hah!”</p>\n<p>Compared to noisy girls beside him, Shira was able to keep his head to his feet. Romana signaled Mila with her eyes when she realized the boy wasn’t so into retaliating against the Malikhs; instead of invading the feast Shira, grabbed Malikh Family’s snacks moderately whenever he could--just like any other normal guests that came here.</p>\n<p>Mila grumbled with a bad mood, faced Shira and said, “Don’t you have something you need to do?”</p>\n<p>“Like what?” Shira hoped this cheeky cousin of his wouldn’t say something about kicking people’s asses again.</p>\n<p>“We can’t wait for something to happen,” she said. “Go ask that bitc--I mean, that fiancée of yours--go ask for a dance. The young’uns are starting to get heated. Look there, one of them couples are dancing. You go join them since that short-haired cunt is your fiancée after all.”</p>\n<p>Mila glanced around for a while before she realized she just had her tongue slipped. She quickly corrected her previous words, “Did I say cunt? I mean short-haired bitch--no, short-haired <em>young lady</em>.”</p>\n<p>“Why don’t you just be honest with yourself here. People have been calling Malikhs much worse here because the foreign priests matter!” Romana laughed.</p>\n<p>At that moment a very young maidservant of Malikh Family just passed by and overheard their conversation. The little maidservant snorted in anger, which made Mila snorted back as a retort.</p>\n<p>“Go, go! Go dance with her!” Mila whispered when she was sure only Shira and Romana were around.</p>\n<p>Shira clicked his tongue. “I don’t even have a single proper conversation with her these past ten years. Why should I go ask her dance out of the blue? Just showing our face around here is enough.”</p>\n<p>“Fool! If she accepted to dance with you then all is good, that would only confirm Malikh Family’s cocky attitude is only because their dipshit brains are getting fried by their own inflated proud ego, nothing serious! But if she ignores you in front of others… heh--she dares!”</p>\n<p>“That’s easy for you to say. If someone you don’t like suddenly asks your hands for a dance, what would you feel later on when you found out refusing means two families become enemies?”</p>\n<p>“Uh-uh, I don’t feel nothing. If he’s my fiancé then it’s my job to go my way out to make it clear in public! Going dancing, going kissing, like a proper damned couple! That’s what the goddamn engagement is all about! Right?”</p>\n<p>Mila ate a cookie and she blinked. Unsure of the previous words she said, she glanced at Romana and murmured, “...right?”</p>\n<p>Romana shrugged.</p>\n<p>But Shira wouldn’t back down easily. He continued arguing, “What if your fiancé is Bony Elzhier, then? Are you going to kiss him to prove he’s your fiancé?”</p>\n<p>Mila hid her gasp.</p>\n<p>“You wanna die?” she pursed her lips. “Listen to me or I’m gonna smack your face!”</p>\n<p>Shira groaned against his cousin’s unreasonableness. But before he could concoct a satisfying retort, Snake and Monkey came out of nowhere.</p>\n<p>“Oh, Young Master Shira,” Monkey came patting him on the shoulder, “it seems you get cuckolded for real this time.”</p>\n<p>People were clapping and whistling as the flashy Young Master Frane Blackwood led Young Lady Bhela Malikh by the hand.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Malikh was entertaining two guests previously, but that bald elder raised a fuss about how she neglected the young noble, so in the end it came to this.”</p>\n<p>Monkey laughed as he teased Shira with his elbow, “They’re going to dance. When two people were dancing in Ngajen Ceremony, that meant they--” he caught the scary experssion on Mila’s face, stopped, “nevermind…”</p>\n<p>“That slut!” Mila hissed.</p>\n<p>This was getting serious. Whenever Mila showed that kind of face something bad would happen. Again, the moment Shira opened his mouth to say something, someone else came to grab him in the shoulder.</p>\n<p>“Brat, your woman is going to cuckold you in public,” said the newcomer, Good-Natured Spirit, who literally came out of the thin air.</p>\n<p>“You too?”</p>\n<p>Shira had a headache. Both Monkey and Snake couldn’t see the annoying Good-Natured Spirit, but the three of them were in harmony in mocking him. They mocked him to the point saying he wouldn’t care would only embarrass him further.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, being led by the hand, Bhela Malikh asked Young Master Blackwood, “What kind of remedy Blackwood Family brought with you?”</p>\n<p>“Why so much in hurry, my young lady?” the young noble gave a laugh and a flash of smile. “No need to worry, Blackwood Family sympathize with the disaster that befell your father, so my mother send me here to personally deliver the medicine Blackwood House had sought far and wide.”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh said nothing more. The Young Master of Blackwood Family pondered as he read the cold expression of the girl, thinking that even with flowers and jewelry gifts, nothing could move this young lady. Such a waste of that beautiful face to not letting a single smile escaped, Young Master Blackwood could only smacked his lips and shook his head. But as soon as he mentioned a medicine he brought for her father, the feisty young lady became amiable almost immediately.</p>\n<p>Good thing for him. Bhela Malikh was talented, the Blackwood Family planned to have her inside their house, and if things went this smoothly he could do that his mother told him sooner than he expected.</p>\n<p>“Little bitch of Malikh Family,” a girl roared, “you finally show your true color you bitch! Is Yashura Family a joke to you?!”</p>\n<p>The furious Mila Yashura became the center of attention. She snorted as she strode, like an angry bull preparing to charge, with the mood that would make the crowd wordlessly give way to her. Not only because they didn’t want anything to do with the infamous young lady of Yashura Family--who, when angry, once punched Bony in the face with a nosebleed--but also because she got a sword in her hands.</p>\n<p>Shira glanced down. His father’s sword he brought with him was gone. He looked again at the unsheated weapon in his cousin’s hands.</p>\n<p>He could only slap his own face the moment he noticed what was happened.</p>\n<p>Mila took a step forward slowly, but her face turned even fiercer. She spoke, “You got guts to bring a lover from outside, eh? I knew something fishy happened when I saw you cut your hair, you little slut.”</p>\n<p>“I cut my hair because it got in the way during my training,” Bhela replied plainly. “And this is not my lover. Just a relative of my friend.”</p>\n<p>“You lying little slut. As if someone like you have any friends!”</p>\n<p>“I do have a friend.” Bhela said. A rare emphasizing tone in her voice was telling that she was upset, but she held back from explaining further.</p>\n<p>“I don’t care what your excuse is! Do you think I don’t know what you shitty Malikhs up to? You already don’t put Yashura Family in your eyes, eh? Just because you bitch have a little vacation outside, eh? If you think you’re a big shot, why don’t you prove it here and now?!”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh was silent for a while. Looking at Mila, she then asked, “And what are you suggesting I should do, Young Lady Yashura?”</p>\n<p>Mila stabbed her sword into the ground.</p>\n<p>“I just want to know how awesome is this Archer class you’ve got overseas that makes you Malikhs stop putting us Yashuras in your eyes,” Mila sneered. “Why don’t we test it with my sword, eh? Let’s do a duel, bitch.”</p>\n<p>Bhela just looked at Mila strangely.</p>\n<p>“But you’re a Specialist class,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Aha! Getting scared, aren’t ya, you little cunt?”</p>\n<p>Bhela didn’t want to argue with her. So she told the nearest servant to go grab a bow.</p>\n<p>On the other side, Monkey anxiously elbowed Shira, said, “Should I drag your cousin back?”</p>\n<p>“Stand down, mister. Mila is the one who’s starting it. She can’t afford to back down now.”</p>\n<p>Beside them Snake was nodding as he understood what Shira meant.</p>\n<p>Then with a laugh, Good-Natured Spirit, who was already tired jeering him, said to Shira. “Kid, shit just got real. Ain’t that a good idea to pull her before it’s too late?”</p>\n<p>Shira wanted to but he couldn’t. He knew exactly Mila’s strength. Fighting bare hands, she might get a chance to stand against the strongest youngster in the village, but it would become a different story when weapons and mana were involved.</p>\n<p>Since Mila was the one to propose the duel, bailing out before the fight began would be slapping her own face in front of the guests. It was a bad idea, because Mila didn’t appear to have the slightest chance to win. So bad that it’d be more reasonable to just surrender. But Shira knew Mila hated to go back on her words the most. Thus he silently moved closer to her, prepared to pull her back in before the situation really got out of his hands.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Young Master Blackwood, was pulled out by an adjutant of his family.</p>\n<p>Smirking, he asked the adjutant, “Who is that girl who picking a fight with Bhela?”</p>\n<p>“Seems like the eldest young lady of that family,” the adjutant replied.</p>\n<p>“You mean the family my Bhela got engaged to?” Young Master Frane Blackwood asked as if Bhela already his. The corner of his lips curled as he thought this might be a good chance to do something on the engagement that Blackwood House already saw as a thorn in their eyes. “Do you have something on that girl?”</p>\n<p>“Replying to young master, since Yashura Family is the main obstacle for us to get Young Lady Bhela Malikh to our side, your mother has already sent someone to investigate them. The eldest young lady of Yashura Family merely a Level 10 Specialist class who just graduated from Novice about seven months ago.”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood couldn’t help but chuckle. Even though the two young ladies had the same level, a Specialist merely support class that wasn’t suited in combat. This duel affair would turn out to be a joke.</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood scoffed. “Let my Bhela teach her some manners. I don’t want anyone to disturb us after this.”</p>\n<p>“Young master,” the adjutant lowered his voice, “I don’t think that’s a good idea.”</p>\n<p>“What’s on your mind, adjutant?”</p>\n<p>“I just made a round to check the guests attending this ceremony, and I found…”--he lowered his voice--“...some spectators amongst the guests that shouldn’t have be here….”</p>\n<p>“Go on,” the young noble urged.</p>\n<p>“I just received the word, young master, there are experts that Elder Jhamil said he didn’t invite.”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood frowned. “What… what’s that supposed to mean?”</p>\n<p>On the less crowded place of the courtyard, the middle-aged man who Bhela greeted before, along with the middle-aged woman, watched the commotion unfold while nibbling on steamed peanuts. He glanced at the other place where a man calmly sipping tea, a man with a hard face who couldn’t hide his sharp aura, then swept his gaze at the one who beside him, a short stature man who wore a headband to hide his reddish hair from public, who also happened to enjoy steamed peanuts while his focus solely at one direction in the crowd.</p>\n<p>All of them came in common garments incognito. But still Elder Jhamil sent people to keep tabs on them, especially since the bald elder still didn’t know the reason Bhela Malikh invited these foreigners.</p>\n<p>The ngajen ceremony usually consisted of three main parts--prayer, socializing, and sending offerings to the mountain as the finale. It was uncommon for irrelevant events to happen between them. However, since the young lady of the host had already accepted the duel, Malikh Family set up an emergency venue for the fight.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil came to invite himself as the judge. For a change to hummiliate those simple Yashuras and to slip himself onto the spotlight, he couldn’t ask for better opportunity.</p>\n<p>“You two ready?” Elder Jhamil asked both of the opposing sides. “This is a friendly match between two friendly families. So stop before your blade hit your enemy,” he said, seemingly talking to either sides, but didn’t say anything about the arrows part.</p>\n<p>Since Bhela Malikh was an Archer, she suggested to Mila, “I’m using a bow. So you can move first. I’ll try to dodge for ten seconds.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t need that,” Mila scoffed.</p>\n<p>“Very well…” she said. She glanced at Elder Jhamil, said, “Elder Jhamil, please begin the duel.&quot;</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil counted to three.</p>\n<p>The duel began.</p>\n<p>“AAAAAA!!!” Mila roared with the sword raised above her head, charging ahead.</p>\n<p>Contrast to her opponent’s battle cry, Bhela was solemn. She picked four arrows from the quiver tied on her hips. Nocking the arrows simultaneously, she took a deep breath as she concentrated to channel different natures elemental mana from her manasphere. The mana, through fingers and her thumb, flowing into all the four arrows and soon the tip of the arrows glowed with four different colors.</p>\n<p>The wind began to stir.</p>\n<p>And she raised the bow. She released the arrows.</p>\n<p><em>Fuuush fuuuushhh fuuushh shhuuuuusshh!</em></p>\n<p>Before even everyone noticed what happened, the mana Bhela channeled melted the flying arrows, within a span of milliseconds, turning them into dangerous magic projectiles of four elemental natures--fire, water, wind and lightning.</p>\n<p>Mila was confident before. She knew a trick against an Archer, but here she was dumbfounded by magic arrows coming to blast her way. She thought she was fighting an Archer, but got up against a Mage instead. This wasn’t what she signed up for.</p>\n<p><em>Clank!</em></p>\n<p>The first blue arrow dissapeared almost the moment it reached Mila. The sound of metallic clash that followed the said arrow resounded three more times, and the three arrows left behind too disappeared almost immediately. Mila, thought she ought to dodge the magic arrows, leap a step backward, but her hasty movement combined with the slippery mud made her slipped her foothold, accidentally fell to her butt instead.</p>\n<p>Bhela aimed down her bow. Everyone was staring at her with complicated and questioning gaze, as an Archer who could do magic, this was the first time everyone witnessed it.</p>\n<p>“It’s a four elemental affinity spell!” someone’s voice roared through the silenced venue, “I heard it, I doubted it, but she really did it!”</p>\n<p>Everyone looked at his way, the man who shouted, and saw that it was the middle-aged man whom Bhela invited from outside the village. He sat eating steamed peanuts then, now he was standing perplexed.</p>\n<p>Bhela, realizing that the man was the center of the attention, and bow to him from afar.</p>\n<p>“She really did it…” the man said under his breath.</p>\n<p>Someone who sat beside him said, “Sure she did, the only one right now--I guess now that you big brain from Elemental Stone School witnessed it I guess you can die without regret?”</p>\n<p>The man looked at the woman who accompanied him, he said still with expression of disbelieve, “It’s a four elemental affinity spell…”</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, you already said that.”</p>\n<p>The last and the most famous multi elemental Unique Class was, a mage with three elemental affinity skills, died of old age--was actually the headmaster of Elemental Stone School from seventy years ago. As a scholar and a mage researching deeply in topics of elemental mana all of his career, how could he didn’t know the value of a Unique Class who surpassed even the ex-headmaster of his school?</p>\n<p>“I can’t believe someone without a Mage Unique Class really did it…”</p>\n<p>“The most promising talent of this generation, alright, the first time I witnessed an Archer could do magic,” the woman said. “Good thing she stopped her arrows then--if not, the other girl would ended up so pitiful.”</p>\n<p>As the woman said that, someone else blurted not far away from there.</p>\n<p>“She didn’t stop it.”</p>\n<p>“Pardon? Sir Kurusiya?” the woman asked.</p>\n<p>The one she was talking to was the quiet man with sharp aura. He said as a matter of fact like tone, “She didn’t stop it. Someone else did,” he sipped his tea, and when the woman still confused, he explained with hoarse voice, “those are magic, but they were still arrows shot from a bow. You can’t stop flying arrows. That girl calculated and slightly missed her aim as to not hurting her opponent. But she didn’t plan to stop it.”</p>\n<p>The woman questioned him, “If she wasn’t the one who stopped it, then would you know why the arrows disappears?”</p>\n<p>The man put down his glass of tea. “I don’t know. Why you ask me? Ask that fool there who’s been grinning all the time.”</p>\n<p>The woman, along with the middle-aged man from Stone Elemental School, looked up to the bearded foreigner.</p>\n<p>“She’s not the one who stopped it,” the bearded man said with a smile.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Mila, who mellowed from her defeat and still sat on the muddy ground, gulped as she saw her cousin come to pick her up.</p>\n<p>“I lost,” she said to Shira.</p>\n<p>“No you didn’t, that girl is the one who put down her bow first, and you still got your swords in your hands--so technically you’d win.”</p>\n<p>“I fell to my butt, I was humiliated,” Mila said, her voice trembled, “I lost….”</p>\n<p>Shira sighed. He grabbed Mila’s hand and pulled her up. “It’s adult problems from hereon, Uncle Shuro would likely summon my father back. For now, let’s get out of here,” he said.</p>\n<p>Monkey and Snake, along with the nervous Romana, came to follow them from behind to shield them from people’s laughter. Mila was so humiliated the usually feisty tomboy was so down she couldn’t afford to hold her head straight. As Shira witnessed how pitiful his cousin was, regret overwhelming him when he remembered how he was holding back from taking action himself.</p>\n<p>“Brat,” someone called him.</p>\n<p>Shira turned his head. It was Good-Natured Spirit.</p>\n<p>“You owe me this time,” the Nalaq said.</p>\n<p>Shira nodded.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>“Hear ye hear ye people! Gather around and hear me announce something incredible, people! Gather around, will ya!”</p>\n<p>Standing on top of a table, Elder Jhamil shouted to gather people, announcing something that the Young Master of Blackwood Family passed him beforehands. “Although winner of the duel is Young Lady Bhela, Young Master Frane of Blackwood House is concerned by some stupid unruly girl of the supposed biggest family in Badril Village behavior would smear my young lady--”</p>\n<p>“Big news! Big news!” someone else’s shouting cut off Elder Jhamil’s announcement, “Young Master Bonithon is running around beating people! Watch your mouth if you don’t want get beaten for no reason!”</p>\n<p>“Bony is going crazy! He’s going to kick people’s asses! Nobody knows why!”</p>\n<p>“What the fuck is going on! Why Elzhier Family messing with us Malikhs now?”</p>\n<p>At the chaotic scene before him, Elder Jhamil’s face showed a frown and a hint of hesitation. He then cleared his phlegm anyway, trying to get people’s attention, then pushed on announcing carefully, “Young Master Frane Blackwood is concerned that--”</p>\n<p>“Elder Jhamil!!” a servant came running with a horrified expression, “Bony is coming for you, run away!”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil pointed his finger at the servant and roared, “What is that brat from Elzhier Family wants to do with me! Go kick him out, I’m trying to tell everybody something important here!”</p>\n<p>“But he doesn’t listen to reasons! He’s going to punch your face, is what he said just now!”</p>\n<p>“Imbecile! Do you think a young master would jump around like a monkey and punch an elder of another family in the damn face?! He’s making ruckus. Go on, kick him out!”</p>\n<p>Looking at the crowd from the rushedly made stage, he then smiled and continued, “Right, everybody, it’s Young Master of Blackwood Family; what I’m saying is that since Young Lady Bhela Malikh is winning with ease against the foolish young lady of <em>that</em> family, Young Master Blackwood concerned that some people would shrug my young lady’s victory. So he proposed, in order to make it clear the disparity between Malikh and--sheesh--Yashura, he proposed that him as a friendly representative of Malikh Family and Shira Yashura as the repre--”</p>\n<p>“Elder Jhamil--watch out!”</p>\n<p>He had it taking from lowly servants who cut off his announcement. Fuming in anger, Elder Jhamil pointed his finger toward the one who was spriting toward him and roared, “How many times I told you to just kick him out! Shut your trap and go kick the damned brat!”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was losing his cool. But what he failed to realize in time was that the one who sprinted toward him wasn’t a servant from his family. It was not the one who telling him to run away. And before he knew it, someone leaped up on the table where he was standing and delivered a punch to the face.</p>\n<p>“Gaaahhh!”</p>\n<p>Even after Elder Jhamil stumbled down the table he stood on, his assaulter didn’t plan to let him go. And what came after that was a torrent of hardened fist, pummeling his face even though he screamed for mercy. Only when the chaotic crowd succeeded in saving him did Elder Jhamil see the assaulter’s face--it was indeed the Young Master from Elzhier Family.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Bonithon… what did you… why did you do this… for what reason?!” Elder Jhamil choked out his grievance.</p>\n<p>Bony, the man who beat the bald elder black and blue, replied with nothing but a cold stare. Instead, it was an almost incoherent voice of Pilek who answered instead.</p>\n<p>“Kekekek, don’t be angry Elder Baldy! We just discussed how you were a splendid Pugilist a long time ago, so Boss Bony came here to find out whether it was true or not! That’s why he asked you to a barehand duel!” Pilek came in with a swagger and a bottle of booze in his hand. From a single glance anybody could tell he was drunk.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s lips trembled. What duel? That brat just leaped out of nowhere without saying anything, then immediately beating him black and blue!</p>\n<p>The only one from the three delinquents who hadn’t had the smell of liquor from his body was Polio. He wore an apologetic smile, and with a slight sigh, he said, “Please forgive them, dear kind Malikh sirs, my friends are terrible when they are drunk.”</p>\n<p>Polio made a round to apologize to any Malikhs he saw. But the Malikh Family didn’t appreciate his gesture, receiving jeerings in return.</p>\n<p>Polio was a patient young man, but Pilek wasn’t. The drunk Pilek didn’t take their attitude kindly, randomly walking to a servant, said, “Hah? What the fuck are you staring me at, you no-name Malikh servant? Wanna die, eh? Huuuraah!!!”</p>\n<p><em>Shatter!</em></p>\n<p>Without a warning he swung the booze in his hand to a Malikh family servant. The man he attacked stumbled backward holding his bloodied head from the crash Pilek gave him.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Bhela Malikh had just settled greeting four foreign guests that she invited from outside, and was on her way to fetch cuisines from the kitchen to humor her guests, then she witnessed the chaotic brawl unfold with a crowdful of cheers and jeers mixed in between. Perhaps there were more than a dozen men involved, with the Malikhs servants, guards, common family members even an elder came along to surround Bony and his two underlings.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela…” a little maidservant with a crest of Elzhier Family in her uniform bowed to Bhela politely.</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at her. She returned the bow even though the other party clearly was a servant. “Miss Elzhier,” she spoke softly.</p>\n<p>“No need to be polite to this servant, Young Lady.”</p>\n<p>“I can’t be impolite to Sister Ryntia’s friends.”</p>\n<p>The Elzhier Family maidservant smiled. Since Bhela insisted, then she wouldn’t be bowing her head anymore.</p>\n<p>She said, “Eldest Young Lady sends me to ask for your forgiveness for her brother’s brashness, Young Lady Bhela.”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at the brawl that started in her family’s courtyard. This chaos would spell imperfect on tonight's Malikh Family’s Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>“There’s no need for that. Since I accepted Young Lady Mila Yashura’s duel then I somewhat anticipated Young Master Bonithon will follow suit to make trouble tonight. If anything, it is I the one who should apologize to Sister Ryntia because I couldn’t handle the situation well. Please tell her that I’ll try to maintain friendship between Malikh and Elzhier Family.”</p>\n<p>Still with the serene smile on her face, the Elzhier Family maidservant studied the expression on Bhela’s face. She spoke a moment after, “Then I’ll let Eldest Young Lady Elzhier knows by tomorrow.”</p>\n<p>“Thanks,” Bhela offered her gratitude with a bow.</p>\n<p>By this time, the brawl became anything but intensified, as men either from Elzhier Family or thugs that previously had dealings with Bony’s group came in to reinforce the Elzhier young master. Before the Malikhs could pressure the intruders with numbers, but then the completely overwhelmed by the new reinforcement.</p>\n<p>“Huurraaahh!” Pilek sent a Malikh man flying with his kick. “Where the fuck your previous cocky taunt? Cat got your tongue, eh?”</p>\n<p>The only unspoken rules in brawls were strictly no usage of mana and spell as well as no sharp objects to use as weapons. But when it was chaotic and nobody could watch everybody the sharpest mind with tricks the one who prevailed--this is why the likes of Pilek and his friend Polio who always struck in place people wouldn’t be willing the one who were taking the advantage in brawls. Even hunters and seasoned guards were no match against these naughty brats.</p>\n<p>For example, when Pilek’s punch was blocked by Elder Jhamil’s son, “You shitty brat, just wait till I deal with your father--kuukgghh!”</p>\n<p>And because no one was watching, Pilek used his knee to strike the cocky young elder in the balls.</p>\n<p>With a sad whimper from his trembling lips, Elder Jhamil’s son curled onto the ground holding his precious balls that Polio struck.</p>\n<p>Seeing that a family elder was mercilessly defeated, a few Malikhs came to avenge their young elder. By then, Pilek already had Polio watching over his back.</p>\n<p>At that point, no Malikhs could match them in hand-in-hand brawl.</p>\n<p>A stranger then casually walked in. Pilek stopped, looking at him, and amidst the chaotic scene it took a while for him to find out that the man was actually a foreigner--an eastern Kaya man. The man had a sheathed sword on his hips. But Pilek wasn’t afraid as long as he stick with the brawl rules to use only fighting unarmed.</p>\n<p>“Huurraaah!”</p>\n<p>Pilek threw a feint. Most simple Malikhs would fall for this. But the eastern Kaya man didn’t budge. Seemed to even anticipate it. With a movement too fast for Pilek to follow the man grabbed his wrist, flicked him and sent him into the air like it was nothing.</p>\n<p>It was only after Pilek rolled in the mud he realized what had happened.</p>\n<p>The man then glanced aside and walked toward Polio who in his own right was too engrossed with the brawl. With his left hand pushing Polio’s shoulder and the other hand grabbing his wrist, he flipped Polio just like he did Pilek beforehand.</p>\n<p>Pilek and a few others that the man previously flipped were amazed by how effortlessly the man disabling enthusiastic young men from fighting.</p>\n<p>The sword handle the man had was wrapped with cloth and its body too thin for regular blades. Those who noticed this would understand that the man wasn’t an ordinary Kaya. Polio was one of them.</p>\n<p>“A Samurai!” he exclaimed a moment after he got thrown onto the muddy ground.</p>\n<p>The Kaya man stopped, looking at him, then spoke with a displeased tone, “I am but a masterless ronin.”</p>\n<p>The man then continued walking toward a different direction.</p>\n<p>Bony was fighting with three men alone, so he couldn’t afford to look around. He didn’t realize the Kaya man at first, but when the man tried to grab the wild young master’s wrist, Bony reacted--he reacted by throwing a punch to the man’s face.</p>\n<p>The man slapped his flying fist from the side, tremendously muffled its momentum. Again, he tried to grab Bony’s wrist and his shoulder. Bony tried resisting but the man’s speed was too fast for him to compete.</p>\n<p>As the man prepared to flip him, Bony felt a faint gush of the wind from his legs. It didn’t take him a second to realize the man just putting his hand on his shoulder as a feint--his real target was to gently nudge his foot on rooting from the ground, which, if he’d focus his effort to get his shoulder free from the man’s grasp, a small window of opening that could be used by his opponent to disrupt his sense of balance. Thus Bony firmly stomped his feet to the ground instead. He grabbed the man’s sleeve to make his opponent not be able to easily throw like Pilek and Polio.</p>\n<p>Responding to Bony’s choice, the man curled the corner of his lips. Bony caught a hint of taunt when he staring the man in the eyes.</p>\n<p>“Kkuuuggghh!”</p>\n<p>Bony did succeed in preventing himself get flipped to the ground. But he got struck in the gut instead.</p>\n<p>The man didn’t let him go. The moment Bony stepping backward due to shock having stricken, the man was charging and got his wrist in the blink of the eyes--what happened afterward was Bony got his feet swept and he completely lost his ground, and got cheered by his friends as the last man who got thrown into the mud.</p>\n<p>Bony then sat there looking as the fight stopped; since someone took him down, more and less the Malikhs had won the brawl.</p>\n<p>“Aren’t you Thoqek’s son?” the Kaya man asked Bony.</p>\n<p>Bony wasn’t willing to open his mouth when his father’s name got mentioned.</p>\n<p>Receiving no answer, the man thus carelessly said, “Unexpectedly, you’ve got more guts than your father. Get up now, and stop making trouble in Ghalim Malikh’s home.”</p>\n<p>The young ruffians with Bony as the leader naturally wouldn’t be arrogant anymore since they had been defeated. They retreated calmly, and the Malikhs didn’t dare taunt them the second time in case Bony would change his mind and started on a rampage again. In the end, the real reason why Bony came targeting Malikh Family, as many people knew, was that he wasn’t a drinker that would lose reason to punch another family’s elder in the face.</p>\n<p>Speaking about an elder who got a punch in the face; after Bony and others were gone, Elder Jhamil showed his nose out of his hiding place. He gritted his teeth. He swore he’d use his full resource to get back from Bony’s father in the next village council meeting.</p>\n<p>“Elder Jhamil, you still haven’t announced the thing I ask you to do,” from behind, the sullen young noble Frane Blackwood said to him.</p>\n<p>“Y-young Master Blackwood, please spare me--the mood isn’t that good to draw people’s attention after that kid crashing our Ngajen Ceremony just now. How about I brief it to other village leaders tomorrow in the village council meeting?”</p>\n<p>“No, I want everyone to know it by tonight. This is the right time and the right place to announce it. Besides, I want to see what kind of a young man the one who’s supposed to be my rival.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil didn’t want to show his beaten face to the crowd tonight. But as much as he love his face he knew flattery wouldn’t get him out of this situation--at least not if he didn’t want to offend the young noble. And so with a heavy face he climbed the table once again, hiding off his reluctancy.</p>\n<p>Someone heartily made a joke on him, “Elder Jhamil, we thought you’re a man who care about face the most--I don’t expect you to boldly show how handsome you’ve become now!”</p>\n<p>“Kids nowadays getting big headed by their privileges as young masters--naturally I’ll let their fathers know how to discipline their brats!” Elder Jhamil coldly said. “Anyway, you all know that my Young Lady Bhela is a girl with talent and her future is boundless. Here in Malikh Family we’re not willing to throw our princess to cow’s dunk that is Yashura Family’s trash young master. And our friend Young Noble Frane Blackwood also thinks the same!”</p>\n<p>Such passionate speech, naturally people were cheering in anticipation of the next spectacle they thought they were going to witness.</p>\n<p>Getting the cue from Elder Jhamil, Frane Blackwood came forward with a swagger. “I speak this as a close friend of Young Lady Bhela Malikh. Someone with the name of Shira Yashura; if you think you’re worthy of her, do you dare to prove it by having a duel with me?!”</p>\n<p>The crowd was silent. They were waiting for the reply.</p>\n<p>Frane Blackwood swept the crowd with his eyes.</p>\n<p>Someone said to him the boy he challenged was utter trash. He was amused guessing how this trash would respond to his duel challenge, especially when Bhela Malikh had just completely defeated the cheeky young lady from his family.</p>\n<p>There were already murmurs spreading. People were also curious whether Shira was going to accept or run away from it.</p>\n<p>And then…</p>\n<p>“<em>Cough, cough…</em>” someone awkwardly stepped forward with a wry smile plastered on his face. People recognized his face, which looked like a monkey, and many of them had seen him together with Shira Yashura.</p>\n<p>He was Monkey. He said, “This young noble… about your proposed duel… I’m afraid Young Master Shira Yashura can’t answer it tonight.”</p>\n<p>Frane Blackwood laughed. “Why? He’s scared? His cousin challenged Young Lady Bhela to a duel for no apparent reason; don’t tell me we can do the same to them?”</p>\n<p>“No, it’s not that.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil pointed his finger at Monkey. “We all know Shira Yashura is a trash who can’t even advance to Level 4 Novice! Young Master Frane Blackwood is kind. Tonight, he’s going to give Shira one chance to admit that he’s unworthy of Young Lady Bhela Malikh to the crowd here. He does that, and there will be no need for Young Master Frane Blackwood to embarrass him by kicking his ass!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, but he can’t give you an answer tonight,” Monkey insisted.</p>\n<p>Now it was Elder Jhamil who laughed. “He’s really scared facing Young Master Frane right now?!”</p>\n<p>“No…”</p>\n<p>“Then why?”</p>\n<p>Monkey sighed.</p>\n<p>“Because he’s already gone home!”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was furious. The whole point he had to gather people even though his face had been beaten by Bony was to call out the boy and embarrass him in public, as per the young noble request. But the said person himself already went home, so Elder Jhamil standing on top of the table was for nothing.</p>\n<p>Immediately he ordered a servant to send the message to Yashura Family, while in between, cursing the fact that he didn’t get the chance to distract the guests from discussing the previous brawl. Sure enough, not only the people were talking about Bhela Malikh’s hidden Unique Class, they were also talking about Bony, and people he beat to pulp, especially Elder Jhamil. People no longer cared to gossip about Young Lady Mila Yashura who had been sent home defeated, but they laughed at someone present who had just his misfortune like Elder Jhamil instead.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil had lost his face in the end. Literally and metaphorically.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, with a solemn expression Monkey looked at his partner Snake who was enjoying the banquet and had amused himself watching the spectacle previously.</p>\n<p>Monkey said with a whisper, “Why the hell your family doesn’t show his face when they dumping shit to Young Master and Young Lady Yashura just now?!”</p>\n<p>Snake glanced at him lazily. “I don’t know. They said they were going to diagnose Patriarch Ghalim Malikh previously.”</p>\n<p>“Can’t you just fetch your brother instead? Didn’t you put your words to assure young master before this? What if he thinks we’re people who put our words lightly?”</p>\n<p>“The one who’s diagnosing the patriarch is my grandfather, my brother supposed to be free enough to be a busybody just now,” Snake said, displeased by Monkey’s tone accusing him of being unloyal to his own word.</p>\n<p>Actually, he also confused why his brother didn’t show his nose when Young Lady Mila recklessly brought a sword to challenge Bhela to a duel. From his understanding of his brother’s character and the relationship between his family and Yashura from what he knew told him that more or less his brother was going to back Yashura if the drama with Malikh Family intensified. But he didn’t. Snake would barge into Malikh Family’s doors to look for his grandfather if he knew it was going to be like this instead.</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-2/chapter-5-1":"<authors-note id=\"Radhy\" type=\"danger\">\n<p>I don’t recommend reading from here onwards because the chapter below is still from the previous draft, which is different from the previous 4 chapters. Further edits will be made that most likely makes this chapter quite different than the current one.</p>\n</authors-note>\n<p>In a certain hall in Malikh Family’s left wing complex, four people sat idly on the bamboo mats covered floor. They were being served local-specialty ginger drinks mixed with brown sugar with herbs to drink. There were also some roasted peanuts to chew. Despite they dressed humbly when attending the Ngajen Ceremony, three of them were elders with statuses, while one of them, the sword bearing Kaya man, wasn’t anyone to ignore either.</p>\n<p>Having knowing this, they still waiting for their host, Bhela Malikh, to wrap up the Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>“Still,” Madame Sylvia said after a sip of ginger drink, “I wouldn’t have expected the girl’s talent to be that rare when she approached my sect with the invitation. The top brass only interested of her being the top grade during the seminar thus sent me to check her out. How about you, Mister Harrington?”</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t expecting it either. I only interested when the report said she showed a potential of being two elemental-affinities Archer. Three already great, but with four elementals, chances she’ll get her name down in history books.”</p>\n<p>“That is what happen if she able to live long enough to develop her full potential,” the quiet man with sharp aura remarked. His face was thin, rough, and since he never liked to smile, he always looked like he meant business. The man was role model of eastern Kaya race ancient warriors--stand and sit in straight posture, humorless, and most importantly, always bringing the sharp, thin sword of katana on his hips.</p>\n<p>Madame Sylvia was interested on his remark. So she asked, “Oh, why you think of that, Sir Kurusiya?”</p>\n<p>The eastern man replied, “Because she tangled herself with Blackwood Family,” he paused. “If this Blackwood the same one from this Blackwood guy I know, then it’s definitely a bad news for her.”</p>\n<p>Mister Harrington from Elemental Stone School disagreed.</p>\n<p>“Since when our factions become soft?” he questioned. “We’re not that pitiful to handle some second-rate noble family. Honestly, I think that young man from that Blackwood Family such a pest. If Young Lady Bhela asks for my favor, I’ll handle him cleanly and thoroughly--right here, right now.”</p>\n<p>“I’m not talking about Blackwood Family, I’m talking about the creepy guy with Blackwood as his last name,” Sir Kurusiya said as he put down his ginger drink. He wasn’t happy, so Madame Sylvia signaled Mister Harrington that it best not to continue arguing with the scary eastern Kaya man.</p>\n<p>The hall suddenly turned quiet. Then, the fourth man was happily enjoyed his drink, out of the blue he blurted for his opinion that no one asked for. “That boy from Yashura Family is sure interesting…”</p>\n<p>Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia smiled wryly. Nobody said anything about Yashura Family up until now. The fourth man, Baront Staterwind, came from a very peculiar faction. Which actually had nothing to do with Bhela’s type of talent. Even when he had already came to Badril Village, none would think he accepted Bhela Malikh’s invitation just to scout her talent.</p>\n<p>The hall’s door was knocked. Bhela entered. She politely greeted the four respected guests before she sat down.</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry for the wait, dear elders. Malikh Family hasn’t prepared the best dishes for you during the ceremony, so I asked the best chef we have to cook special meals for you,” Bhela said, then she glanced at the door. “Please enter, aunty!”</p>\n<p>The moment she called, a middle-aged woman who helped Bhela in the kitchen before came with a line of maidservants, bringing freshly cooked dinner meals with them. It was better than what the Malikhs served for the guests before, even compared to the meals served for the family’s important guests cooked by Bhela as the chief chef.</p>\n<p>“I rather you serve me some alcohol,” the eastern Sir Kurusiya said to her.</p>\n<p>Bhela nodded at his request and asked the aunty to fetch the best alcohol she could find. Of course, the best person to get help was the elder who provided Bhela with the hall to host her guests. Bhela hoped the said elder already knew the importance of this meeting thus not being stingy with his alcohol collection.</p>\n<p>“Can we start now, young lady? I don’t have a good alcohol tolerance so I rather get this completed before us adults get to drink,” Madame Sylvia said.</p>\n<p>“We have delicious food here served, Madame Sylvia. To be honest, all the wait before is for the aunties preparing dinner for dear elders,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>But not of the adults believed her words easily.</p>\n<p>“Hoho, you seem so nervous, young lady. You might not look like it, but you seem about to cry,” Sir Baront Staterwind said.</p>\n<p>“Just state what you want from us, don’t waste anymore time,” Sir Kurusiya urged.</p>\n<p>Bhela lowered her head. With her lips tremblingly parted, she said, “As you might know, my father fell ill when I was overseas attending the seminar. My mother has contacted many doctors and alchemists to make medicines for him, yet my father’s condition never improved. I request for elders’ wisdom and strength, please help my poor father, he was in misery for months…”</p>\n<p>Bhela prostated.</p>\n<p>“Please, help me father… he’s dying… please…” she begged.</p>\n<p>Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia exchanged glances. The peculiar beardy man, Sir Baront, merely nodded without letting his thoughts known. Meanwhile, Sir Kurusiya, who didn’t bulge seeing the pretty girl begging in front of him, coldly said, “Well, this is really a waste of time.”</p>\n<p>Hearing the eastern man snorted, Bhela’s heart went cold. She prepared herself bowing down for help, without stating a single offer to prove how desperate herself.</p>\n<p>“And, young lady…” Madame Sylvia asked slowly, “what would you do if someone managed to heal your father?”</p>\n<p>Bhela rose up. She looked straight to Madam Sylvia’s gaze, then said, “Anything,”</p>\n<p>“Anything?”</p>\n<p>“Anything.”</p>\n<p>The room went quiet. Only Mister Harrington’s regretful sigh could be heard.</p>\n<p>It was Sir Baront Staterwind who explained with a good intention, “It really seems you haven’t grasped the situation you were in, young lady. The guest who gave you the gift from before, he’s a young master of a family known as the peerless medicine makers and doctors. If they couldn’t cure your father illness, then I believe no one in this room knows who really can.”</p>\n<p>“If I had a petty mind, young lady, I’d kill for the cosmetic you got from them. That’s how valuable their skills are,” Madam Sylvia said as she shook her head in pity.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh bit her lips. She was eloquent when she invited these experts months ago. Yet tonight, she had completely became tongue-tied and defeated. The cold air suddenly felt more unbearable. Although the warm meals’ delicious aroma wafted through the hall, not a single person had any incentive to touch their food. Everyone in the hall sunken into silence.</p>\n<p>“You want my advice, young lady?” the sharp voice of Sir Kurusiya sliced through the awkward atmosphere. He continued, “Having turned your back against Yashura Family is the dumbest decision you did. I didn’t come here because of you. I know your father, and I certainly know that swordsman from Yashura Family more. It’s a pity I couldn’t meet them today. Really, a complete waste miles and miles of journey.”</p>\n<p>With that, Sir Kurusiya, stood up and prepared to leave.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh quickly swallowed her bitterness, also stood up and said, “Please, Elder Kurusiya, let me see you the way out.”</p>\n<p>“No, don’t,” Sir Kurusiya flatly rejected her offer. “Sit down. These three fogies still haven’t decided what they want to do with you. Better think carefully about what you’re going to say to them next.”</p>\n<p>The eastern man saw himself out. Following his suggestion, Bhela Malikh sat down again and faced the three experts, with her mind suddenly became as blank as a barren field in the corner of abandoned land. She didn’t know what she ought to say to them, seeing the looks of pity they directed at her. Then, just when she managed to regain her bravery to say something, the door slammed open--</p>\n<p>“I come as the representative of Blackwood Family!” Young Master Frane Blackwood boldly yelled.</p>\n<p>He swagered himself in along with Elder Jhamil’s son and the adjutant of Blackwood Family under his wings. The arrogant behaviour of this young noble completely disregard the experts in the room. Madame Sylvia had enough. She dissed him, “What are you doing here uninvited?”</p>\n<p>Instead of the adjutant who usually spoke for his young master, it was the young elder of Malikh Family, Elder Jhamil’s son who replying. “This madam has eyes but doesn’t know what good for her. Of course Young Master Blackwood is invited! He’s the special guest of Malikh Family after all!”</p>\n<p>“What’s your name, boy?” the middle-aged woman hissed.</p>\n<p>“I’m Elder Jhamil’s eldest son! What’s up with you, you don’t have the right to know my name!”</p>\n<p>“Is that it? Very well. It seems just because I respect the southerner custom by dressing commonly you ignorant people already forgot what's best for you. Very well!”</p>\n<p><em>Zziiing!</em></p>\n<p>With a flashing draw of metallic sword, Madame Sylvia stood up to give this ignorant young elder a lesson. But her companion Mister Harrington quickly pulled her back before things really blown up.</p>\n<p>“You brought a weapon with you!” the Elder Jhamil’s son screamed with his finger pointing at Madame Sylvia who already trembling holding back her fury. “Do you not know what’s gonna happen to guests who bring weapons inside their host’s home?”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood rolled his eyes and told his adjutant, “Send this toad out of here, he’s too noisy!”</p>\n<p>“Right away,” the adjutant said. Then with his bony hands, he pulled the screaming Elder Jhamil’s son forcefully.</p>\n<p>“Is the discussion still ongoing?” Frane Blackwood asked the sitting guests as he tightened the blue necktie he wore. He said to Bhela, “Blackwood Family offers a lifetime terms of benefit for you, young lady. Not only medicines, if it boost potion you ask, or equipments, magic items, weapons--you name it, we have all things you’d dare to imagine!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho,” his uninvited offer gave Sir Baront Staterwind a chuckle. The three guests Bhela invited hailed from their own factions, so even if they wanted to rope Bhela in, they would consult with their higher ups about the specific terms they’d give to her as benefits. However, Blackwood Family was, in fact, only a noble family, not an organizational faction, with the only way in was through marriage--so of course the young noble would be able to offer a “lifetime benefits” to her so brazenly.</p>\n<p>“Thank you for holding back your anger, Madame Sylvia,” Bhela completely bowed her head to the angry guest while she completely disregarded Young Master Blackwood’s offers.</p>\n<p>Madame Sylvia nodded. She then looked at Young Master Blackwood and snorted. “Young lady, think carefully about what we said before. Some incapable people only able to spout honey trap to get what they want. Don’t be foolish because your father’s situation.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you for the advice…”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood wanted to argue with this lady. But he also held himself back as he didn’t know the other party’s identity. Therefore, all he could do was haughtily smiling elegantly as a proper noble as he was.</p>\n<p>“Has the discussion already started?” Frane Blackwood asked again. Pity him, not even one interested in answering. Because of that his face became red as he fumed with anger.</p>\n<p>“Ah,” Sir Baront Staterwind looked outside the window and slapped his thigh, “look how late it is! I planned to sleep early because I have something I need to do tomorrow early in the morning!”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh quickly offered to see him till the gate.</p>\n<p>“Hoho, how about you two?” Sir Baront asked the last two foreign experts, the pair of middle-aged man and woman, “overstaying your visit is considering a burden to these good Mossack folks, don’t you think so?”</p>\n<p>“I’m but an ignorant western lady, I know little about the way of the southern people, so please don’t mind us being shameless,” Madame Sylvia said. She then looked at Bhela, “Young Lady Bhela, Mister Harrington and I apparently haven’t booked our place in the village’s inns. We don’t know our talks would turned out dragged this late. For this I have to beg you to let us stay in Malikh Family for a few good days.”</p>\n<p>“Hoho…” Sir Baront Staterwind chuckled as he looked at the poker face pair of experts. Wasn’t the four of them--including Sir Kurusiya, checked in the same inn this afternoon? It was clear Madame Sylvia and Mister Harrington had their own intentions, thus Sir Baront Staterwind shrugged the idea of exposing their little white lies.</p>\n<p>And with that, Bhela Malikh led the three expert guests she invited out of the room. Young Master Blackwood, who was ignored so hard she almost exploded, yelling, “Young Lady Bhela!”</p>\n<p>Bhela turned around. “Yes, Young Master Blackwood?”</p>\n<p>“How about me?”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh blinked. Then she picked a bowl of roasted peanuts and approached him, saying softly, “Please sit down and enjoy this snack. I need to attend to my guests.”</p>\n<p>Hearing her soft, yet slightly cold voice, Young Lady Blackwood the understood something that made him excited, so excited he obediently sat down and nimbled on the roasted peanuts the beautiful Young Lady Bhela gave him.</p>\n<p>Then after Bhela brought the guests out, the Blackwood Family adjutant who was waiting outside came in inside the hall.</p>\n<p>“What are you doing?!” Young Master Blackwood hissed.</p>\n<p>The adjutant gawked. “Young master, I’m here to serve you…”</p>\n<p>“Serve me?” the young master cringed. What a joke! Soon he’d have a time being alone with Young Lady Bhela, and this old man wanted to be here right when he had the chance of his lifetime? What if there--during the discussion--was an accident where he had to be responsible as a man? Would he be happy if the adjutant was here when that happened?</p>\n<p>Absolutely not!</p>\n<p>“Get out! Don’t dawdle around here tonight! I need to discuss an important manner with Young Lady Bhela secretly!”</p>\n<p>“Y-young master--”</p>\n<p>“What are you waiting for! Go back to the inn and don’t bother me till the next morning!”</p>\n<p>The adjutant naturally understood what was inside the young master’s mind. He didn’t dare to linger around. With careful steps, he closed the door and went back to the inn Blackwood Family checked in.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Young Master Blackwood was so excited he couldn’t sit calmly alone in the hall. The thought of having private discussion with a girl as pretty as Bhela Malikh made him thinking a lot of things. Slowly, he getting horny.</p>\n<p>“What is taking her so long?” he mumbled to himself after waiting a fruitless thirty minutes. “Is it maybe she needs to… prepare, herself?”</p>\n<p>If it was going to be her first time, of course she needed time to prepare herself, Young Master Blackwood thought. This young noble had “befriend” and participating in “private discussions” with many experienced women. But virgin girls, he never tasted any.</p>\n<p>Because of that, he willing to wait however much longer for the young lady to prepare herself. And thus, after waiting for another thirty minutes, nothing happened. Nothing happened for the next hour as well. Then, after waiting for nearly three hours alone, the door finally opened…</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela, you finally ready!” Young Master Blackwood snapped out of his sleepy face and excitedly came to greet the visitor. Much to his disappointment, the visitor turned out to be the faithful adjutant.</p>\n<p>“Why is that you?!” Young Master Blackwood roared.</p>\n<p>“Y-young master… let’s get back to the inn,” the adjutant nervously asked.</p>\n<p>“Where’s Young Lady Bhela?”</p>\n<p>“She is in her room…”</p>\n<p>“Then you send someone there to ask her when she’s going to meet me,” the young noble ordered.</p>\n<p>“I’m afraid I can’t… young master…”</p>\n<p>“I’ve been waiting for hours, why?”</p>\n<p>The adjutant gulped before he replied.</p>\n<p>“Because the young lady has already gone sleeping since three hours ago!”</p>\n<p>So much for his dreamy private discussion! Young Master Blackwood was so angry for being misled that he slapped the adjutant’s face all the way back to his inn.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A single torch on a stick stubbornly lit the corner of the village in spite of the strong wind. A howling wolf in the distance reinforced the lone, cold sense of the midnight Badril Village. The only shop that still open at this hours could be counted with one hand, and this liquor shop was one of them. No customer visited it except a foreign eastern Kaya man.</p>\n<p>A series of step could be heard. The sleepy shopkeeper snapped back when he heard a new customer approaching.</p>\n<p>“Give me a glass of <em>tuak</em>, shopkeeper,” the new customer ordered with a booming voice. One could see his beardy feature when his face exposed to the shop’s lantern light. “Mind if I join you, Sir Kurusiya?”</p>\n<p>The eastern man didn’t reply. He drank his alcohol instead.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront Staterwind laughed by his cold treatment. The beardy guy was an easygoing person, so he casually grabbed a bowl of steamed peanuts and started to nibble on those snacks.</p>\n<p>“You’re not visiting Bhela’s father? You said you know him, you know, saying hi to a sick old buddy?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t say hi to a dying man,” Sir Kurusiya said.</p>\n<p>The answer made the air awkward. So Sir Baront quickly came with another topic.</p>\n<p>“It seems those two lovers adamant to protect the girl,” he said, referring to the other two experts who once were couple before Mister Harrington lost Madame Sylvia to another guy. “Or I think they just want some privacy to have some little reunion… who knows?”</p>\n<p>Sir Kurusiya never bothered with petty gossip, he callously replied, “They don’t know Malikh Family. They can’t protect her forever.”</p>\n<p>“Exactly,” Sir Baront Staterwind agreed. After that both men continued drinking without saying anything.</p>\n<p>“Hey shopkeeper,” Sir Baront called, “don’t you have anything with less alcohol? I have a business I’d like to deal with tomorrow, so I want to avoid shitty hangover.”</p>\n<p>“I have some sweet <em>tuak</em>,” the shopkeeper poured a new bottle into Sir Baront’s empty glass, “this one usually for them boys who haven’t gone coming of age ceremony. No alcohol, costs as little as four copper kobe coins.”</p>\n<p>“Four coppers, ah! Why’s that the souther I go the cheaper the drink?” he sipped it, “mm! Pretty good, my good man!”</p>\n<p>He tipped the shopkeeper with a silver coin. The shopkeeper was dumbfounded but quickly recovered and hid the coin safely.</p>\n<p>Sir Kurusiya said to Sir Baront, “You want to go to Yashura Family tomorrow?”</p>\n<p>“How did you know?”</p>\n<p>“Even though I can’t see him, I know the one who repelled Bhela’s arrow was a Nalaq,” Sir Kurusiya said.</p>\n<p>“Hoho, since I managed to rope in the young lady of Yurin Family, I’ve got promoted to an instructor,” Sir Baront smiled widely. “Doing the legwork isn’t my job anymore… but checking him and the boy won’t hurt, so I’m going. Hmm, I wonder if the Nalaq has already form his contract?”</p>\n<p>“Huuh…” the shopkeeper, who had been hearing their chatting, couldn’t help but asked, “you good sir, what’s this talking about a Nalaq having to do with Yashura Family?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, you’re a Yashura?” Sir Baront asked.</p>\n<p>“I’m Elzhier, from the outer family,” the shopkeeper said. “I’ve been in this village for forty years, but never I’ve heard any Nalaq passing by.”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, that’s why I’m going. Usually a rogue Nalaq isn’t someone tied with a faction, so they aren’t that big of deal--which also make them easier to rope in!”</p>\n<p>“Ooohh! Are you a Nalaq expert, mister? From overseas? Our family’s eldest young lady actually was scouted by a passing expert from overseas too, an expert from purple something sect!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, you mean Purple Garden Sect?” Sir Baront Staterwind and asked as he played along.</p>\n<p>But Sir Kurusiya was sceptic. “Purple Garden Sect is too far. And someone from that kind of superpower faction won’t be too idle to accidentally passing by on this kind of rural village.”</p>\n<p>Sir Baront nodded at Sir Kurusiya’s logic. Even if it was that particular sect that accepted the said young lady, both experts wouldn’t be too sure about whether she could be the sect’s legitimate disciple. Their doubts made the shopkeeper embarrassed. Since ten years ago, the tales of the eldest young lady of Elzhier Family being accepted by a foreign expert was a legend amongst Badril Village locals. Except her and the recent Malikh Family’s young lady, no one in the village was lucky got scouted to study oversea, so it became a fact that Elzhier Family was very proud of--and was one of the reasons why the Elzhier could win the village head’s seat from Yashura Family after their decades of leading Badril Village. But the problem was, in the letters their young lady sent home, she always talked about shops, fashions, and some other trivial stuffs that usually young women her age excited about. That made even her father, the current Elzhier Family’s patriarch and the Village Head, felt it was became difficult to still boasting the young lady’s status after ten years of her spending overseas.</p>\n<p>“But still, experts, you might not know this, but our eldest young lady was Young Lady of Malikh Family’s closest childhood friend! When Young Lady Bhela Malikh only a little girl our young lady gave her a lot of pointers and knowledge, so much that I assure that if it wasn’t for her being there for Young Lady Bhela, the Malikh Family wouldn’t get their talented Unique Class for at least the next one hundred years!”</p>\n<p>“Right…” Sir Baront became awkward instantly. To think some ignorant folks believed blessing of Unique Classes was that simple, even Sir Kurusiya scoffed at the idea.</p>\n<p>The shopkeeper’s face became red as he realized it was wise not to delay any longer. So he quickly said, “If you have some spare time, sir experts, I’m sure our Elzhier Family willing to entertain you!”</p>\n<p>After paying for their drinks, even the agreeable Sir Baront Staterwind felt it was very awkward for him to return to this little shop. Both decided not to get themselves involved with Elzhier Family after the shopkeeper’s little salesman talks, whilst not knowing the inn they stayed inn owned by Elzhier Family.</p>\n<p>On the way back, Sir Baront asked Sir Kurusiya for advice.</p>\n<p>“Yo, Kurusiya, I’m going to accept the Yashura boy as my third disciple if the Nalaq’s pretty good. But, you know, the Nalaq who contracted with youngest disciple is a master thirteen thousands years ago. She was a heavy weight figure, so I reckon I’ll let her calls the shot. What’s your opinion on this?”</p>\n<p>“How powerful is this Nalaq you’re talking about?”</p>\n<p>Sir Baront grinned. “You know the legend about Seven Pillars of Tiramikal Continent? She’s the Frost Mage mentioned in that history. Pretty neat, huh? She was able to revive as Nalaq and regained her consciousness five years ago. All the big shots in my Blue Robe Society can’t wait for the girl she’s contracted with to formally accepted into our faction.”</p>\n<p>“If that’s the case then your disciple isn’t necesserily worse than Malikh’s four elemental Archer girl.”</p>\n<p>“So you know why I can’t accept the boy if he’s too crude--I can’t afford to offend this madam Nalaq even the slightest bit.” he took out a bag of roasted peanuts he bought from the shopkeeper, and started to nibble on them. “I’m going to write a letter to my disciples, they’ve been playing around in the neighboring village. This madam Nalaq will come and check the boy herself.”</p>\n<p>Sir Kurusiya abruptly stopped his steps.</p>\n<p>“You want my advice?” he looked straight at Sir Baront’s eyes. “My advice is simple. You’re going to make this madam Nalaq of yours polite and you’re going to beg her to be mindful of her attitude in front of Yashura Family.”</p>\n<p>“You’re joking? You serious?”</p>\n<p>“I’m always serious,” Sir Kurusiya said.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Patriarch of Yashura Family, Shuro Yashura, was exhilarated to see Grandpa Piss and Snotty came to visit the village. One part because he treasured the friendships between their family and Grandpa Piss’s relatives, but mainly, he got to show-off his latest coconut cake recipe.</p>\n<p>“Ah, this is life, drinking <em>tuak</em> when we’re watching the moon, getting drunk while we’re eating coconuts. What a life!” Patriarch Shuro mumbled.</p>\n<p>“What a life indeed,” Grandpa Piss nodded with a low chuckle. On the sky, the full moon was shining bright really beautiful.</p>\n<p>After he’d done his part in ngajen ceremony, Patriarch Shuro Yashura accompanied the old Alchemist and his grandson in a spacious veranda, where they ate coconut cakes and drinking _tuak _while spending time moongazing. They had the Yashura Family’s sole butler, Yulong, to hold the _tuak _bottle and refilled their cups when empty.</p>\n<p>“Grandpa Piss, why didn’t you tell us beforehand before you visit Badril Village? We ran out of <em>rendang</em> before even the ceremony ended, so I’m sorry if you couldn’t eat <em>rendang</em>!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, we already ate chicken curry in Malikh Family, you don’t have to prepare food for us,” Grandpa Piss said.</p>\n<p>“How about breakfast? Are we still have leftover chickens, Yulong?”</p>\n<p>“We still have some leftover grilled village chicken, I’ll talk with the kitchen to reheat two portion first thing in the morning,” Yulong said.</p>\n<p>The Yashura Family’s patriarch was a role model of the stereotype Mossack people. He loved to cook and loved even more to feed people. It was no wonder why southern Mossacks’ visitors always felt welcomed whenever they visited the southern lands.</p>\n<p>“I sent them to bring <em>rendang</em> to Malikh Family, I never expected something like that to happen, hah!” Patriarch Shuro shook his head with a weak smile plastered on his face. During their talk, Grandpa Piss mentioned they met with Shira and Mila, as well mentioned the duel that happened between the two families’ young ladies and the upcoming duel between Shira and the young noble from Blackwood Family. “Whatever, if jerks wanted to fight with us, we won’t back down. Yashura Family never a coward!”</p>\n<p>“I believe Young Master Shira knows what he has to do,” Grandpa Piss assured.</p>\n<p>“I hope so, pity his father never around to hold the sky falling for him,” Patriarch Shuro gulped his <em>tuak</em>. “Anyway, let’s talk about something else. That Ghalim, you checked on him, Grandpa? What’s happened to him?”</p>\n<p>Snotty a little scared when Shuro Yashura suddenly brought up that topic. Snotty glanced at Butler Yulong’s wrinkled face, Yulong smiled back at him. The big muscle man couldn’t help but shuddered inside.</p>\n<p>“Patriarch Ghalim isn’t feeling well after eating some unhygienic food. I already prescribed some medicine for him, but I don’t know when he’d be able to get back at being patriarch since his digestive system was never good.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, is that so? Never knew he had something like that,” Patriarch Shuro mumbled. “There’s this really bad rumor about him being poisoned, Grandpa Piss, we never had something wicked like that in Badril Village.”</p>\n<p>“No, no no no, I can assure you, it’s not poison. I’ve been in the business more than seventy years--it’s <em>not</em> a poison.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss helped Yashura Family a lot when the patriarch’s in-law, Jhuro’s wife, had Shira in her belly. So Patriarch Shuro had long esteemed Grandpa Piss’s medicinal skill, even though he didn’t really had any idea how skillful the friendly old man was. He believed Grandpa Piss in the end.</p>\n<p>“We shouldn’t talk about sad things, Patriarch. Here, I bought a <em>tuak</em> my family handmade ourself. Let’s give it a try,” Grandpa Piss said.</p>\n<p>“Please, let me,” Butler Yulong asked the <em>tuak</em> bottle Grandpa Piss took out and poured it evenly to Patriarch Shuro’s, Grandpa Piss’s, along with Snotty’s glasses.</p>\n<p>The second thing Patriarch Shuro loved, after coconuts, was a strong <em>tuak</em>. He was the first one to gulp his glass clean, and he sighed about how good Grandpa Piss’s family <em>tuak</em> craft was. However, soon after that, his eyes somehow became heavy.</p>\n<p>“Huhh… usually, I still can drink till dawn…” Patriarch Shuro said with a yawn. “Let’s drink together… come on, Snotty, come drink with Uncle Shuro more.”</p>\n<p>“Patriarch, I think you are tired,” Yulong said softly, rejecting to pour patriarch’s glass.</p>\n<p>“Snotty, you go accompany Uncle Shuro inside,” Grandpa Piss said.</p>\n<p>Snotty nodded while still holding his glass full of <em>tuak</em>. The liquor was definitely mixed with something. Considering it was his grandfather who presented it, it was amazing to see Patriarch Shuro Yashura to be able to resist the urge to sleepiness. Snotty stood up and brought the yawning Shuro Yashura away.</p>\n<p>After both of them gone, Yulong picked up a clean glass. He poured the liquor that made Patriarch Shuro sleepy and drank it for himself. Grandpa Piss took out his second bottle and accompanied Yulong drinking <em>tuak</em>.</p>\n<p>“Is there’s something you need to discuss with me?” Yulong asked.</p>\n<p>“Indeed, it’s about Ghalim Malikh’s real condition…” Grandpa Piss didn’t leave any details when he told the Butler Yulong what had really happened in Malikh Family, particularly his discovery about the true nature of poison that made Patriarch Ghalim bedridden.</p>\n<p>When he heard that shocking fact, there was no surprise in the butler’s old face. Only sorrow and regret.</p>\n<p>“I knew this would happened,” Yulong sighed.</p>\n<p>“Then there’s Blackwood Family too…” Grandpa Piss’s sigh followed. “They seems interested in taking away Young Lady Bhela as a bride… I really don’t know what to say…”</p>\n<p>Yulong drank the <em>tuak</em> and told Grandpa Piss his reasoning, “That boy from Blackwood Family still hasn’t accepted Sir Jhuro’s decission to retire sixteen years ago. He’s been keeping quiet because he knew even the royalty and the organization behind him couldn’t protect him from Old Sir Lharu’s and Old Madam Sari’s retrubution. Time’s change. I reckon there’s some change somewhere that make him cocky.”</p>\n<p>“Old Sir and Old Madam too far away to give help in case something like this happens suddenly. Should I help you and Sir Jhuro keeping tabs on Blackwood Family?” Grandpa Piss asked.</p>\n<p>While Jhuro Yashura left behind resources and men outside before he retired, he almost never interacted with the high society of nobility. For ears and eyes to reach those fancy places, it would take time and efforts for current Yulong and Shuro Yashura to do so. It was way better to ask Grandpa Piss who already familiar due to his family’s generations of Alchemist profession. However, Yulong rejected the offer without giving it a real thought.</p>\n<p>“You don’t need to worry. Blackwood Family only taking a ride of that boy’s ambition. If he really supports his foster family right from the start, Blackwood won’t be stuck with their viscount nobility rank.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss wanted to offer any more help, but he long sensed the old butler’s distrust of him on affairs that didn’t include medicines and elixirs. So he kept his mouth shut for the time being.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, a golden owl landed on the veranda where the two old men enjoyed their <em>tuak</em>. The own brought a small piece of paper and inked quill with it.</p>\n<p>“Go, send this message to Sir Jhuro, as fast as possible!” Butler Yulong said to the owl after he wrote his tiny letter. Then he glanced at Grandpa Piss and said, “this is an owl I keep around in case there’s an emergency. Sir Jhuro also brought one with him.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss nodded with a painful smile. This golden owl was long thought to be extinct, but the reality there were small amounts of them were being kept in case of emergencies. They were rare, almost becoming birds of legend. Small to medium sized kingdoms wouldn’t dare to think getting their hands on it, not to mention Grandpa Piss’s own family. But this old butler had one with him. And the prodigial man of Yashura Family casually brought this treasure bird with him to travel around the southern land.</p>\n<p>“This is really for emergency,” Yulong said coldly, knowing full well the old Alchemist’s envy.</p>\n<p>“I know, I know--for emergency.”</p>\n<p>The owl then flew away bringing Yulong’s letter.</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss and Snotty returned back to their own village the next morning. After sending them away, Yulong found out the young master, Shira Yashura, wanted to go to the market to pick some goods for his contracted pedlers to sell. He was worried the young master’s inexperience getting him exploited. Therefore, he waited in the gate and followed the boy from behind.</p>\n<p>In front of an inn owned by Elzhier Family, Yulong saw a familiar eastern Kaya man came out with a respectable, but humble Mossack man behind him. The Kaya man, Sir Kurusiya, noticed Yulong, immediately cupped his fist and bowed his body. That was a salute of great respect eastern Kaya men usually give to people they regard highly. Sir Baront Staterwind didn’t know what was going on, so he imitated his companion to salute Yulong even though he didn’t really know he was only a butler.</p>\n<p>“You know them, Yulong?” Shira asked.</p>\n<p>“The Kaya man once works in the same place as your father, young master.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, that’s why you know him.” Yulong was his mother helper, and his father brought him along to Yashura Family when Shira still in his mother’s belly. Shira never liked to listen about his father’s past, even though it was often glorified since he was completely stopped marauding bandits from approaching Badril Village. Walking toward the market, Shira kept quiet and didn’t ask the matter any further.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Far away from Badril Village, the golden owl Yulong tasked with the emergency letter flew through walls of mist and mountains. It instinctively knew the location of its recipient, Jhuro Yashura, even though Yulong wasn’t necesserarily knew where he was. Not even a half day passed by since the bird took off from Yashura Family, it flew already more than halfway toward its destination.</p>\n<p>Its speed was unprecendeted amongst the magical beast. No wonder commonfolks thought it was the bird of the legend. It was a shame that it failed to detect a single flash on the horizon, resulting it to succumb to a terrible fate.</p>\n<p><em>Flap flap flap!</em></p>\n<p>The owl futilely tried to avoid danger.</p>\n<p>A single flash all it took to capture the dumbfounded owl. A pair of cold talons gripped its short neck and the next thing it knew, the owl panically flapping its wings in search of oxygen, only to be deprived of fresh air even more. The owl couldn’t see the beast, it only saw a dashingly crimson flash before it was captured by the neck. The hostile beast scretched, only after that the owl realized a damned predator eagle already got it. Annoyed by the owl’s desperate struggle, the eagle broke its neck. The handsome crimson-colored eagle then delivered the dead owl to a mysterious masked man, who then passed it to another man--a pale, thin man who only dressed himself as black as the phantom itself.</p>\n<p>“This owl coming out from Yashura Family, Mister Blackwood. The bird brings a letter with it,” the masked man said as he presented the letter to the pale man.</p>\n<p>“Ah, so they figured it out about the poison,” the pale man with Blackwood surname said. Beside him and the masked man, there was a third man who drained the blood of the golden owl, prepared a little feast of its dead body. The man was very peculiar; bald, with veined oversized muscles that looked like it was almost exploded, and the strange tatooes that covered its body. He was a northern barbarian, the kind that never took orders from civilized men no matter they came from the west, south, or the east. Yet, when the Blackwood guy told him top plucking the dead owl, he obidiently put aside the carcass, not daring to show any hints of disatisfaction.</p>\n<p>“Mister, the young lady of Malikh Family turns out to be a four-elemental Unique Class, she’s a real talent with tremendous potential--your sister tries to take her to Blackwood Family and having a setback because there’s some experts happened to visit Malikh Family. Shall we send anymore resources to help her?”</p>\n<p>“What’s her Blackwood Family have to do with me? It’s already good enough I let her to use my name to coerce people and strengthen her influence in commerce world. She’s getting annoying every time she’s using my toys. That Jhuju’s poison I sent to her only a reminder to Ghalim of our old friendship, my sister should be thankful enough if she gets some benefits from it.”</p>\n<p>The masked man knew the pale man was irritated by his sister’s cockiness. So he excused himself and brought the crimson eagle with him, disappearing into the shadow.</p>\n<p>“We’ve rested enough,” the pale man said as he crumbled the small letter he read. The bald barbarian’s head cocked and he await the order. “Prepare the horses,” the man continued, “I’ve got an old friend I should say hi to.”</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-2/chapter-5":"<authors-note id=\"Radhy\" type=\"danger\">\n<p>I don’t recommend reading from here onwards because the chapter below is still from the previous draft, which is different from the previous 4 chapters. Further edits will be made that most likely makes this chapter quite different than the current one.</p>\n</authors-note>\n<p>In a certain hall in Malikh Family’s left wing complex, four people sat idly on the bamboo mats covered floor. They were being served local-specialty ginger drinks mixed with brown sugar with herbs to drink. There were also some roasted peanuts to chew. Despite they dressed humbly when attending the Ngajen Ceremony, three of them were elders with statuses, while one of them, the sword bearing Kaya man, wasn’t anyone to ignore either.</p>\n<p>Having knowing this, they still waiting for their host, Bhela Malikh, to wrap up the Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>“Still,” Madame Sylvia said after a sip of ginger drink, “I wouldn’t have expected the girl’s talent to be that rare when she approached my sect with the invitation. The top brass only interested of her being the top grade during the seminar thus sent me to check her out. How about you, Mister Harrington?”</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t expecting it either. I only interested when the report said she showed a potential of being two elemental-affinities Archer. Three already great, but with four elementals, chances she’ll get her name down in history books.”</p>\n<p>“That is what happen if she able to live long enough to develop her full potential,” the quiet man with sharp aura remarked. His face was thin, rough, and since he never liked to smile, he always looked like he meant business. The man was role model of eastern Kaya race ancient warriors--stand and sit in straight posture, humorless, and most importantly, always bringing the sharp, thin sword of katana on his hips.</p>\n<p>Madame Sylvia was interested on his remark. So she asked, “Oh, why you think of that, Sir Kurusiya?”</p>\n<p>The eastern man replied, “Because she tangled herself with Blackwood Family,” he paused. “If this Blackwood the same one from this Blackwood guy I know, then it’s definitely a bad news for her.”</p>\n<p>Mister Harrington from Elemental Stone School disagreed.</p>\n<p>“Since when our factions become soft?” he questioned. “We’re not that pitiful to handle some second-rate noble family. Honestly, I think that young man from that Blackwood Family such a pest. If Young Lady Bhela asks for my favor, I’ll handle him cleanly and thoroughly--right here, right now.”</p>\n<p>“I’m not talking about Blackwood Family, I’m talking about the creepy guy with Blackwood as his last name,” Sir Kurusiya said as he put down his ginger drink. He wasn’t happy, so Madame Sylvia signaled Mister Harrington that it best not to continue arguing with the scary eastern Kaya man.</p>\n<p>The hall suddenly turned quiet. Then, the fourth man was happily enjoyed his drink, out of the blue he blurted for his opinion that no one asked for. “That boy from Yashura Family is sure interesting…”</p>\n<p>Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia smiled wryly. Nobody said anything about Yashura Family up until now. The fourth man, Baront Staterwind, came from a very peculiar faction. Which actually had nothing to do with Bhela’s type of talent. Even when he had already came to Badril Village, none would think he accepted Bhela Malikh’s invitation just to scout her talent.</p>\n<p>The hall’s door was knocked. Bhela entered. She politely greeted the four respected guests before she sat down.</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry for the wait, dear elders. Malikh Family hasn’t prepared the best dishes for you during the ceremony, so I asked the best chef we have to cook special meals for you,” Bhela said, then she glanced at the door. “Please enter, aunty!”</p>\n<p>The moment she called, a middle-aged woman who helped Bhela in the kitchen before came with a line of maidservants, bringing freshly cooked dinner meals with them. It was better than what the Malikhs served for the guests before, even compared to the meals served for the family’s important guests cooked by Bhela as the chief chef.</p>\n<p>“I rather you serve me some alcohol,” the eastern Sir Kurusiya said to her.</p>\n<p>Bhela nodded at his request and asked the aunty to fetch the best alcohol she could find. Of course, the best person to get help was the elder who provided Bhela with the hall to host her guests. Bhela hoped the said elder already knew the importance of this meeting thus not being stingy with his alcohol collection.</p>\n<p>“Can we start now, young lady? I don’t have a good alcohol tolerance so I rather get this completed before us adults get to drink,” Madame Sylvia said.</p>\n<p>“We have delicious food here served, Madame Sylvia. To be honest, all the wait before is for the aunties preparing dinner for dear elders,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>But not of the adults believed her words easily.</p>\n<p>“Hoho, you seem so nervous, young lady. You might not look like it, but you seem about to cry,” Sir Baront Staterwind said.</p>\n<p>“Just state what you want from us, don’t waste anymore time,” Sir Kurusiya urged.</p>\n<p>Bhela lowered her head. With her lips tremblingly parted, she said, “As you might know, my father fell ill when I was overseas attending the seminar. My mother has contacted many doctors and alchemists to make medicines for him, yet my father’s condition never improved. I request for elders’ wisdom and strength, please help my poor father, he was in misery for months…”</p>\n<p>Bhela prostated.</p>\n<p>“Please, help me father… he’s dying… please…” she begged.</p>\n<p>Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia exchanged glances. The peculiar beardy man, Sir Baront, merely nodded without letting his thoughts known. Meanwhile, Sir Kurusiya, who didn’t bulge seeing the pretty girl begging in front of him, coldly said, “Well, this is really a waste of time.”</p>\n<p>Hearing the eastern man snorted, Bhela’s heart went cold. She prepared herself bowing down for help, without stating a single offer to prove how desperate herself.</p>\n<p>“And, young lady…” Madame Sylvia asked slowly, “what would you do if someone managed to heal your father?”</p>\n<p>Bhela rose up. She looked straight to Madam Sylvia’s gaze, then said, “Anything,”</p>\n<p>“Anything?”</p>\n<p>“Anything.”</p>\n<p>The room went quiet. Only Mister Harrington’s regretful sigh could be heard.</p>\n<p>It was Sir Baront Staterwind who explained with a good intention, “It really seems you haven’t grasped the situation you were in, young lady. The guest who gave you the gift from before, he’s a young master of a family known as the peerless medicine makers and doctors. If they couldn’t cure your father illness, then I believe no one in this room knows who really can.”</p>\n<p>“If I had a petty mind, young lady, I’d kill for the cosmetic you got from them. That’s how valuable their skills are,” Madam Sylvia said as she shook her head in pity.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh bit her lips. She was eloquent when she invited these experts months ago. Yet tonight, she had completely became tongue-tied and defeated. The cold air suddenly felt more unbearable. Although the warm meals’ delicious aroma wafted through the hall, not a single person had any incentive to touch their food. Everyone in the hall sunken into silence.</p>\n<p>“You want my advice, young lady?” the sharp voice of Sir Kurusiya sliced through the awkward atmosphere. He continued, “Having turned your back against Yashura Family is the dumbest decision you did. I didn’t come here because of you. I know your father, and I certainly know that swordsman from Yashura Family more. It’s a pity I couldn’t meet them today. Really, a complete waste miles and miles of journey.”</p>\n<p>With that, Sir Kurusiya, stood up and prepared to leave.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh quickly swallowed her bitterness, also stood up and said, “Please, Elder Kurusiya, let me see you the way out.”</p>\n<p>“No, don’t,” Sir Kurusiya flatly rejected her offer. “Sit down. These three fogies still haven’t decided what they want to do with you. Better think carefully about what you’re going to say to them next.”</p>\n<p>The eastern man saw himself out. Following his suggestion, Bhela Malikh sat down again and faced the three experts, with her mind suddenly became as blank as a barren field in the corner of abandoned land. She didn’t know what she ought to say to them, seeing the looks of pity they directed at her. Then, just when she managed to regain her bravery to say something, the door slammed open--</p>\n<p>“I come as the representative of Blackwood Family!” Young Master Frane Blackwood boldly yelled.</p>\n<p>He swagered himself in along with Elder Jhamil’s son and the adjutant of Blackwood Family under his wings. The arrogant behaviour of this young noble completely disregard the experts in the room. Madame Sylvia had enough. She dissed him, “What are you doing here uninvited?”</p>\n<p>Instead of the adjutant who usually spoke for his young master, it was the young elder of Malikh Family, Elder Jhamil’s son who replying. “This madam has eyes but doesn’t know what good for her. Of course Young Master Blackwood is invited! He’s the special guest of Malikh Family after all!”</p>\n<p>“What’s your name, boy?” the middle-aged woman hissed.</p>\n<p>“I’m Elder Jhamil’s eldest son! What’s up with you, you don’t have the right to know my name!”</p>\n<p>“Is that it? Very well. It seems just because I respect the southerner custom by dressing commonly you ignorant people already forgot what's best for you. Very well!”</p>\n<p><em>Zziiing!</em></p>\n<p>With a flashing draw of metallic sword, Madame Sylvia stood up to give this ignorant young elder a lesson. But her companion Mister Harrington quickly pulled her back before things really blown up.</p>\n<p>“You brought a weapon with you!” the Elder Jhamil’s son screamed with his finger pointing at Madame Sylvia who already trembling holding back her fury. “Do you not know what’s gonna happen to guests who bring weapons inside their host’s home?”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood rolled his eyes and told his adjutant, “Send this toad out of here, he’s too noisy!”</p>\n<p>“Right away,” the adjutant said. Then with his bony hands, he pulled the screaming Elder Jhamil’s son forcefully.</p>\n<p>“Is the discussion still ongoing?” Frane Blackwood asked the sitting guests as he tightened the blue necktie he wore. He said to Bhela, “Blackwood Family offers a lifetime terms of benefit for you, young lady. Not only medicines, if it boost potion you ask, or equipments, magic items, weapons--you name it, we have all things you’d dare to imagine!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho,” his uninvited offer gave Sir Baront Staterwind a chuckle. The three guests Bhela invited hailed from their own factions, so even if they wanted to rope Bhela in, they would consult with their higher ups about the specific terms they’d give to her as benefits. However, Blackwood Family was, in fact, only a noble family, not an organizational faction, with the only way in was through marriage--so of course the young noble would be able to offer a “lifetime benefits” to her so brazenly.</p>\n<p>“Thank you for holding back your anger, Madame Sylvia,” Bhela completely bowed her head to the angry guest while she completely disregarded Young Master Blackwood’s offers.</p>\n<p>Madame Sylvia nodded. She then looked at Young Master Blackwood and snorted. “Young lady, think carefully about what we said before. Some incapable people only able to spout honey trap to get what they want. Don’t be foolish because your father’s situation.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you for the advice…”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood wanted to argue with this lady. But he also held himself back as he didn’t know the other party’s identity. Therefore, all he could do was haughtily smiling elegantly as a proper noble as he was.</p>\n<p>“Has the discussion already started?” Frane Blackwood asked again. Pity him, not even one interested in answering. Because of that his face became red as he fumed with anger.</p>\n<p>“Ah,” Sir Baront Staterwind looked outside the window and slapped his thigh, “look how late it is! I planned to sleep early because I have something I need to do tomorrow early in the morning!”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh quickly offered to see him till the gate.</p>\n<p>“Hoho, how about you two?” Sir Baront asked the last two foreign experts, the pair of middle-aged man and woman, “overstaying your visit is considering a burden to these good Mossack folks, don’t you think so?”</p>\n<p>“I’m but an ignorant western lady, I know little about the way of the southern people, so please don’t mind us being shameless,” Madame Sylvia said. She then looked at Bhela, “Young Lady Bhela, Mister Harrington and I apparently haven’t booked our place in the village’s inns. We don’t know our talks would turned out dragged this late. For this I have to beg you to let us stay in Malikh Family for a few good days.”</p>\n<p>“Hoho…” Sir Baront Staterwind chuckled as he looked at the poker face pair of experts. Wasn’t the four of them--including Sir Kurusiya, checked in the same inn this afternoon? It was clear Madame Sylvia and Mister Harrington had their own intentions, thus Sir Baront Staterwind shrugged the idea of exposing their little white lies.</p>\n<p>And with that, Bhela Malikh led the three expert guests she invited out of the room. Young Master Blackwood, who was ignored so hard she almost exploded, yelling, “Young Lady Bhela!”</p>\n<p>Bhela turned around. “Yes, Young Master Blackwood?”</p>\n<p>“How about me?”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh blinked. Then she picked a bowl of roasted peanuts and approached him, saying softly, “Please sit down and enjoy this snack. I need to attend to my guests.”</p>\n<p>Hearing her soft, yet slightly cold voice, Young Lady Blackwood the understood something that made him excited, so excited he obediently sat down and nimbled on the roasted peanuts the beautiful Young Lady Bhela gave him.</p>\n<p>Then after Bhela brought the guests out, the Blackwood Family adjutant who was waiting outside came in inside the hall.</p>\n<p>“What are you doing?!” Young Master Blackwood hissed.</p>\n<p>The adjutant gawked. “Young master, I’m here to serve you…”</p>\n<p>“Serve me?” the young master cringed. What a joke! Soon he’d have a time being alone with Young Lady Bhela, and this old man wanted to be here right when he had the chance of his lifetime? What if there--during the discussion--was an accident where he had to be responsible as a man? Would he be happy if the adjutant was here when that happened?</p>\n<p>Absolutely not!</p>\n<p>“Get out! Don’t dawdle around here tonight! I need to discuss an important manner with Young Lady Bhela secretly!”</p>\n<p>“Y-young master--”</p>\n<p>“What are you waiting for! Go back to the inn and don’t bother me till the next morning!”</p>\n<p>The adjutant naturally understood what was inside the young master’s mind. He didn’t dare to linger around. With careful steps, he closed the door and went back to the inn Blackwood Family checked in.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Young Master Blackwood was so excited he couldn’t sit calmly alone in the hall. The thought of having private discussion with a girl as pretty as Bhela Malikh made him thinking a lot of things. Slowly, he getting horny.</p>\n<p>“What is taking her so long?” he mumbled to himself after waiting a fruitless thirty minutes. “Is it maybe she needs to… prepare, herself?”</p>\n<p>If it was going to be her first time, of course she needed time to prepare herself, Young Master Blackwood thought. This young noble had “befriend” and participating in “private discussions” with many experienced women. But virgin girls, he never tasted any.</p>\n<p>Because of that, he willing to wait however much longer for the young lady to prepare herself. And thus, after waiting for another thirty minutes, nothing happened. Nothing happened for the next hour as well. Then, after waiting for nearly three hours alone, the door finally opened…</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela, you finally ready!” Young Master Blackwood snapped out of his sleepy face and excitedly came to greet the visitor. Much to his disappointment, the visitor turned out to be the faithful adjutant.</p>\n<p>“Why is that you?!” Young Master Blackwood roared.</p>\n<p>“Y-young master… let’s get back to the inn,” the adjutant nervously asked.</p>\n<p>“Where’s Young Lady Bhela?”</p>\n<p>“She is in her room…”</p>\n<p>“Then you send someone there to ask her when she’s going to meet me,” the young noble ordered.</p>\n<p>“I’m afraid I can’t… young master…”</p>\n<p>“I’ve been waiting for hours, why?”</p>\n<p>The adjutant gulped before he replied.</p>\n<p>“Because the young lady has already gone sleeping since three hours ago!”</p>\n<p>So much for his dreamy private discussion! Young Master Blackwood was so angry for being misled that he slapped the adjutant’s face all the way back to his inn.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A single torch on a stick stubbornly lit the corner of the village in spite of the strong wind. A howling wolf in the distance reinforced the lone, cold sense of the midnight Badril Village. The only shop that still open at this hours could be counted with one hand, and this liquor shop was one of them. No customer visited it except a foreign eastern Kaya man.</p>\n<p>A series of step could be heard. The sleepy shopkeeper snapped back when he heard a new customer approaching.</p>\n<p>“Give me a glass of <em>tuak</em>, shopkeeper,” the new customer ordered with a booming voice. One could see his beardy feature when his face exposed to the shop’s lantern light. “Mind if I join you, Sir Kurusiya?”</p>\n<p>The eastern man didn’t reply. He drank his alcohol instead.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront Staterwind laughed by his cold treatment. The beardy guy was an easygoing person, so he casually grabbed a bowl of steamed peanuts and started to nibble on those snacks.</p>\n<p>“You’re not visiting Bhela’s father? You said you know him, you know, saying hi to a sick old buddy?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t say hi to a dying man,” Sir Kurusiya said.</p>\n<p>The answer made the air awkward. So Sir Baront quickly came with another topic.</p>\n<p>“It seems those two lovers adamant to protect the girl,” he said, referring to the other two experts who once were couple before Mister Harrington lost Madame Sylvia to another guy. “Or I think they just want some privacy to have some little reunion… who knows?”</p>\n<p>Sir Kurusiya never bothered with petty gossip, he callously replied, “They don’t know Malikh Family. They can’t protect her forever.”</p>\n<p>“Exactly,” Sir Baront Staterwind agreed. After that both men continued drinking without saying anything.</p>\n<p>“Hey shopkeeper,” Sir Baront called, “don’t you have anything with less alcohol? I have a business I’d like to deal with tomorrow, so I want to avoid shitty hangover.”</p>\n<p>“I have some sweet <em>tuak</em>,” the shopkeeper poured a new bottle into Sir Baront’s empty glass, “this one usually for them boys who haven’t gone coming of age ceremony. No alcohol, costs as little as four copper kobe coins.”</p>\n<p>“Four coppers, ah! Why’s that the souther I go the cheaper the drink?” he sipped it, “mm! Pretty good, my good man!”</p>\n<p>He tipped the shopkeeper with a silver coin. The shopkeeper was dumbfounded but quickly recovered and hid the coin safely.</p>\n<p>Sir Kurusiya said to Sir Baront, “You want to go to Yashura Family tomorrow?”</p>\n<p>“How did you know?”</p>\n<p>“Even though I can’t see him, I know the one who repelled Bhela’s arrow was a Nalaq,” Sir Kurusiya said.</p>\n<p>“Hoho, since I managed to rope in the young lady of Yurin Family, I’ve got promoted to an instructor,” Sir Baront smiled widely. “Doing the legwork isn’t my job anymore… but checking him and the boy won’t hurt, so I’m going. Hmm, I wonder if the Nalaq has already form his contract?”</p>\n<p>“Huuh…” the shopkeeper, who had been hearing their chatting, couldn’t help but asked, “you good sir, what’s this talking about a Nalaq having to do with Yashura Family?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, you’re a Yashura?” Sir Baront asked.</p>\n<p>“I’m Elzhier, from the outer family,” the shopkeeper said. “I’ve been in this village for forty years, but never I’ve heard any Nalaq passing by.”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, that’s why I’m going. Usually a rogue Nalaq isn’t someone tied with a faction, so they aren’t that big of deal--which also make them easier to rope in!”</p>\n<p>“Ooohh! Are you a Nalaq expert, mister? From overseas? Our family’s eldest young lady actually was scouted by a passing expert from overseas too, an expert from purple something sect!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, you mean Purple Garden Sect?” Sir Baront Staterwind and asked as he played along.</p>\n<p>But Sir Kurusiya was sceptic. “Purple Garden Sect is too far. And someone from that kind of superpower faction won’t be too idle to accidentally passing by on this kind of rural village.”</p>\n<p>Sir Baront nodded at Sir Kurusiya’s logic. Even if it was that particular sect that accepted the said young lady, both experts wouldn’t be too sure about whether she could be the sect’s legitimate disciple. Their doubts made the shopkeeper embarrassed. Since ten years ago, the tales of the eldest young lady of Elzhier Family being accepted by a foreign expert was a legend amongst Badril Village locals. Except her and the recent Malikh Family’s young lady, no one in the village was lucky got scouted to study oversea, so it became a fact that Elzhier Family was very proud of--and was one of the reasons why the Elzhier could win the village head’s seat from Yashura Family after their decades of leading Badril Village. But the problem was, in the letters their young lady sent home, she always talked about shops, fashions, and some other trivial stuffs that usually young women her age excited about. That made even her father, the current Elzhier Family’s patriarch and the Village Head, felt it was became difficult to still boasting the young lady’s status after ten years of her spending overseas.</p>\n<p>“But still, experts, you might not know this, but our eldest young lady was Young Lady of Malikh Family’s closest childhood friend! When Young Lady Bhela Malikh only a little girl our young lady gave her a lot of pointers and knowledge, so much that I assure that if it wasn’t for her being there for Young Lady Bhela, the Malikh Family wouldn’t get their talented Unique Class for at least the next one hundred years!”</p>\n<p>“Right…” Sir Baront became awkward instantly. To think some ignorant folks believed blessing of Unique Classes was that simple, even Sir Kurusiya scoffed at the idea.</p>\n<p>The shopkeeper’s face became red as he realized it was wise not to delay any longer. So he quickly said, “If you have some spare time, sir experts, I’m sure our Elzhier Family willing to entertain you!”</p>\n<p>After paying for their drinks, even the agreeable Sir Baront Staterwind felt it was very awkward for him to return to this little shop. Both decided not to get themselves involved with Elzhier Family after the shopkeeper’s little salesman talks, whilst not knowing the inn they stayed inn owned by Elzhier Family.</p>\n<p>On the way back, Sir Baront asked Sir Kurusiya for advice.</p>\n<p>“Yo, Kurusiya, I’m going to accept the Yashura boy as my third disciple if the Nalaq’s pretty good. But, you know, the Nalaq who contracted with youngest disciple is a master thirteen thousands years ago. She was a heavy weight figure, so I reckon I’ll let her calls the shot. What’s your opinion on this?”</p>\n<p>“How powerful is this Nalaq you’re talking about?”</p>\n<p>Sir Baront grinned. “You know the legend about Seven Pillars of Tiramikal Continent? She’s the Frost Mage mentioned in that history. Pretty neat, huh? She was able to revive as Nalaq and regained her consciousness five years ago. All the big shots in my Blue Robe Society can’t wait for the girl she’s contracted with to formally accepted into our faction.”</p>\n<p>“If that’s the case then your disciple isn’t necesserily worse than Malikh’s four elemental Archer girl.”</p>\n<p>“So you know why I can’t accept the boy if he’s too crude--I can’t afford to offend this madam Nalaq even the slightest bit.” he took out a bag of roasted peanuts he bought from the shopkeeper, and started to nibble on them. “I’m going to write a letter to my disciples, they’ve been playing around in the neighboring village. This madam Nalaq will come and check the boy herself.”</p>\n<p>Sir Kurusiya abruptly stopped his steps.</p>\n<p>“You want my advice?” he looked straight at Sir Baront’s eyes. “My advice is simple. You’re going to make this madam Nalaq of yours polite and you’re going to beg her to be mindful of her attitude in front of Yashura Family.”</p>\n<p>“You’re joking? You serious?”</p>\n<p>“I’m always serious,” Sir Kurusiya said.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Patriarch of Yashura Family, Shuro Yashura, was exhilarated to see Grandpa Piss and Snotty came to visit the village. One part because he treasured the friendships between their family and Grandpa Piss’s relatives, but mainly, he got to show-off his latest coconut cake recipe.</p>\n<p>“Ah, this is life, drinking <em>tuak</em> when we’re watching the moon, getting drunk while we’re eating coconuts. What a life!” Patriarch Shuro mumbled.</p>\n<p>“What a life indeed,” Grandpa Piss nodded with a low chuckle. On the sky, the full moon was shining bright really beautiful.</p>\n<p>After he’d done his part in ngajen ceremony, Patriarch Shuro Yashura accompanied the old Alchemist and his grandson in a spacious veranda, where they ate coconut cakes and drinking _tuak _while spending time moongazing. They had the Yashura Family’s sole butler, Yulong, to hold the _tuak _bottle and refilled their cups when empty.</p>\n<p>“Grandpa Piss, why didn’t you tell us beforehand before you visit Badril Village? We ran out of <em>rendang</em> before even the ceremony ended, so I’m sorry if you couldn’t eat <em>rendang</em>!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, we already ate chicken curry in Malikh Family, you don’t have to prepare food for us,” Grandpa Piss said.</p>\n<p>“How about breakfast? Are we still have leftover chickens, Yulong?”</p>\n<p>“We still have some leftover grilled village chicken, I’ll talk with the kitchen to reheat two portion first thing in the morning,” Yulong said.</p>\n<p>The Yashura Family’s patriarch was a role model of the stereotype Mossack people. He loved to cook and loved even more to feed people. It was no wonder why southern Mossacks’ visitors always felt welcomed whenever they visited the southern lands.</p>\n<p>“I sent them to bring <em>rendang</em> to Malikh Family, I never expected something like that to happen, hah!” Patriarch Shuro shook his head with a weak smile plastered on his face. During their talk, Grandpa Piss mentioned they met with Shira and Mila, as well mentioned the duel that happened between the two families’ young ladies and the upcoming duel between Shira and the young noble from Blackwood Family. “Whatever, if jerks wanted to fight with us, we won’t back down. Yashura Family never a coward!”</p>\n<p>“I believe Young Master Shira knows what he has to do,” Grandpa Piss assured.</p>\n<p>“I hope so, pity his father never around to hold the sky falling for him,” Patriarch Shuro gulped his <em>tuak</em>. “Anyway, let’s talk about something else. That Ghalim, you checked on him, Grandpa? What’s happened to him?”</p>\n<p>Snotty a little scared when Shuro Yashura suddenly brought up that topic. Snotty glanced at Butler Yulong’s wrinkled face, Yulong smiled back at him. The big muscle man couldn’t help but shuddered inside.</p>\n<p>“Patriarch Ghalim isn’t feeling well after eating some unhygienic food. I already prescribed some medicine for him, but I don’t know when he’d be able to get back at being patriarch since his digestive system was never good.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, is that so? Never knew he had something like that,” Patriarch Shuro mumbled. “There’s this really bad rumor about him being poisoned, Grandpa Piss, we never had something wicked like that in Badril Village.”</p>\n<p>“No, no no no, I can assure you, it’s not poison. I’ve been in the business more than seventy years--it’s <em>not</em> a poison.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss helped Yashura Family a lot when the patriarch’s in-law, Jhuro’s wife, had Shira in her belly. So Patriarch Shuro had long esteemed Grandpa Piss’s medicinal skill, even though he didn’t really had any idea how skillful the friendly old man was. He believed Grandpa Piss in the end.</p>\n<p>“We shouldn’t talk about sad things, Patriarch. Here, I bought a <em>tuak</em> my family handmade ourself. Let’s give it a try,” Grandpa Piss said.</p>\n<p>“Please, let me,” Butler Yulong asked the <em>tuak</em> bottle Grandpa Piss took out and poured it evenly to Patriarch Shuro’s, Grandpa Piss’s, along with Snotty’s glasses.</p>\n<p>The second thing Patriarch Shuro loved, after coconuts, was a strong <em>tuak</em>. He was the first one to gulp his glass clean, and he sighed about how good Grandpa Piss’s family <em>tuak</em> craft was. However, soon after that, his eyes somehow became heavy.</p>\n<p>“Huhh… usually, I still can drink till dawn…” Patriarch Shuro said with a yawn. “Let’s drink together… come on, Snotty, come drink with Uncle Shuro more.”</p>\n<p>“Patriarch, I think you are tired,” Yulong said softly, rejecting to pour patriarch’s glass.</p>\n<p>“Snotty, you go accompany Uncle Shuro inside,” Grandpa Piss said.</p>\n<p>Snotty nodded while still holding his glass full of <em>tuak</em>. The liquor was definitely mixed with something. Considering it was his grandfather who presented it, it was amazing to see Patriarch Shuro Yashura to be able to resist the urge to sleepiness. Snotty stood up and brought the yawning Shuro Yashura away.</p>\n<p>After both of them gone, Yulong picked up a clean glass. He poured the liquor that made Patriarch Shuro sleepy and drank it for himself. Grandpa Piss took out his second bottle and accompanied Yulong drinking <em>tuak</em>.</p>\n<p>“Is there’s something you need to discuss with me?” Yulong asked.</p>\n<p>“Indeed, it’s about Ghalim Malikh’s real condition…” Grandpa Piss didn’t leave any details when he told the Butler Yulong what had really happened in Malikh Family, particularly his discovery about the true nature of poison that made Patriarch Ghalim bedridden.</p>\n<p>When he heard that shocking fact, there was no surprise in the butler’s old face. Only sorrow and regret.</p>\n<p>“I knew this would happened,” Yulong sighed.</p>\n<p>“Then there’s Blackwood Family too…” Grandpa Piss’s sigh followed. “They seems interested in taking away Young Lady Bhela as a bride… I really don’t know what to say…”</p>\n<p>Yulong drank the <em>tuak</em> and told Grandpa Piss his reasoning, “That boy from Blackwood Family still hasn’t accepted Sir Jhuro’s decission to retire sixteen years ago. He’s been keeping quiet because he knew even the royalty and the organization behind him couldn’t protect him from Old Sir Lharu’s and Old Madam Sari’s retrubution. Time’s change. I reckon there’s some change somewhere that make him cocky.”</p>\n<p>“Old Sir and Old Madam too far away to give help in case something like this happens suddenly. Should I help you and Sir Jhuro keeping tabs on Blackwood Family?” Grandpa Piss asked.</p>\n<p>While Jhuro Yashura left behind resources and men outside before he retired, he almost never interacted with the high society of nobility. For ears and eyes to reach those fancy places, it would take time and efforts for current Yulong and Shuro Yashura to do so. It was way better to ask Grandpa Piss who already familiar due to his family’s generations of Alchemist profession. However, Yulong rejected the offer without giving it a real thought.</p>\n<p>“You don’t need to worry. Blackwood Family only taking a ride of that boy’s ambition. If he really supports his foster family right from the start, Blackwood won’t be stuck with their viscount nobility rank.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss wanted to offer any more help, but he long sensed the old butler’s distrust of him on affairs that didn’t include medicines and elixirs. So he kept his mouth shut for the time being.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, a golden owl landed on the veranda where the two old men enjoyed their <em>tuak</em>. The own brought a small piece of paper and inked quill with it.</p>\n<p>“Go, send this message to Sir Jhuro, as fast as possible!” Butler Yulong said to the owl after he wrote his tiny letter. Then he glanced at Grandpa Piss and said, “this is an owl I keep around in case there’s an emergency. Sir Jhuro also brought one with him.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss nodded with a painful smile. This golden owl was long thought to be extinct, but the reality there were small amounts of them were being kept in case of emergencies. They were rare, almost becoming birds of legend. Small to medium sized kingdoms wouldn’t dare to think getting their hands on it, not to mention Grandpa Piss’s own family. But this old butler had one with him. And the prodigial man of Yashura Family casually brought this treasure bird with him to travel around the southern land.</p>\n<p>“This is really for emergency,” Yulong said coldly, knowing full well the old Alchemist’s envy.</p>\n<p>“I know, I know--for emergency.”</p>\n<p>The owl then flew away bringing Yulong’s letter.</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss and Snotty returned back to their own village the next morning. After sending them away, Yulong found out the young master, Shira Yashura, wanted to go to the market to pick some goods for his contracted pedlers to sell. He was worried the young master’s inexperience getting him exploited. Therefore, he waited in the gate and followed the boy from behind.</p>\n<p>In front of an inn owned by Elzhier Family, Yulong saw a familiar eastern Kaya man came out with a respectable, but humble Mossack man behind him. The Kaya man, Sir Kurusiya, noticed Yulong, immediately cupped his fist and bowed his body. That was a salute of great respect eastern Kaya men usually give to people they regard highly. Sir Baront Staterwind didn’t know what was going on, so he imitated his companion to salute Yulong even though he didn’t really know he was only a butler.</p>\n<p>“You know them, Yulong?” Shira asked.</p>\n<p>“The Kaya man once works in the same place as your father, young master.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, that’s why you know him.” Yulong was his mother helper, and his father brought him along to Yashura Family when Shira still in his mother’s belly. Shira never liked to listen about his father’s past, even though it was often glorified since he was completely stopped marauding bandits from approaching Badril Village. Walking toward the market, Shira kept quiet and didn’t ask the matter any further.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Far away from Badril Village, the golden owl Yulong tasked with the emergency letter flew through walls of mist and mountains. It instinctively knew the location of its recipient, Jhuro Yashura, even though Yulong wasn’t necesserarily knew where he was. Not even a half day passed by since the bird took off from Yashura Family, it flew already more than halfway toward its destination.</p>\n<p>Its speed was unprecendeted amongst the magical beast. No wonder commonfolks thought it was the bird of the legend. It was a shame that it failed to detect a single flash on the horizon, resulting it to succumb to a terrible fate.</p>\n<p><em>Flap flap flap!</em></p>\n<p>The owl futilely tried to avoid danger.</p>\n<p>A single flash all it took to capture the dumbfounded owl. A pair of cold talons gripped its short neck and the next thing it knew, the owl panically flapping its wings in search of oxygen, only to be deprived of fresh air even more. The owl couldn’t see the beast, it only saw a dashingly crimson flash before it was captured by the neck. The hostile beast scretched, only after that the owl realized a damned predator eagle already got it. Annoyed by the owl’s desperate struggle, the eagle broke its neck. The handsome crimson-colored eagle then delivered the dead owl to a mysterious masked man, who then passed it to another man--a pale, thin man who only dressed himself as black as the phantom itself.</p>\n<p>“This owl coming out from Yashura Family, Mister Blackwood. The bird brings a letter with it,” the masked man said as he presented the letter to the pale man.</p>\n<p>“Ah, so they figured it out about the poison,” the pale man with Blackwood surname said. Beside him and the masked man, there was a third man who drained the blood of the golden owl, prepared a little feast of its dead body. The man was very peculiar; bald, with veined oversized muscles that looked like it was almost exploded, and the strange tatooes that covered its body. He was a northern barbarian, the kind that never took orders from civilized men no matter they came from the west, south, or the east. Yet, when the Blackwood guy told him top plucking the dead owl, he obidiently put aside the carcass, not daring to show any hints of disatisfaction.</p>\n<p>“Mister, the young lady of Malikh Family turns out to be a four-elemental Unique Class, she’s a real talent with tremendous potential--your sister tries to take her to Blackwood Family and having a setback because there’s some experts happened to visit Malikh Family. Shall we send anymore resources to help her?”</p>\n<p>“What’s her Blackwood Family have to do with me? It’s already good enough I let her to use my name to coerce people and strengthen her influence in commerce world. She’s getting annoying every time she’s using my toys. That Jhuju’s poison I sent to her only a reminder to Ghalim of our old friendship, my sister should be thankful enough if she gets some benefits from it.”</p>\n<p>The masked man knew the pale man was irritated by his sister’s cockiness. So he excused himself and brought the crimson eagle with him, disappearing into the shadow.</p>\n<p>“We’ve rested enough,” the pale man said as he crumbled the small letter he read. The bald barbarian’s head cocked and he await the order. “Prepare the horses,” the man continued, “I’ve got an old friend I should say hi to.”</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-2/chapter-6":"<p>When the news about what happened in Malikh Family’s ngajen ceremony arrived at Blackwood Family, Madam Blackwood was so enraged she broke the tea cup she held onto the floor. Establishing the family’s foot in Badril Village was supposed to be easy, but not only he failed to gain the support of Malikh Family and the villagers, the Young Master of Blackwood Family somehow managed to incite the bedridden patriarch’s supporters to regain their lost foothold against the corrupt Malikh Family’s elders.</p>\n<p>“There’s no point keeping him in that rural village,” Madam Blackwood said. She was a flamboyant, late thirty years old woman whose beauty was so superior that the previous viscount adopt her as a daughter. “Call Frane back to the city, he’s going to spend two months training in capital!”</p>\n<p>The butler who was waiting for her bowed and went away to carry out the task.</p>\n<p>“How’s Lyla’s birthday party going?”</p>\n<p>“Reply to madam, the party has started, the guests who came only from baron nobilities and mid-rank merchants,” a maid replied.</p>\n<p>The madam glanced the timid middle-aged man who sat on the same table as her. She scoffed, saying, “Look how your daughter made a name for herself. Not only the bribe money was wasted away, she coming on trips in the seminars only resulting her made a fool out of herself! Hah, like father, like daughter! Imbecile!”</p>\n<p>Madam Blackwood hurled the new cup that recently poured with hot, scalding tea. She purposely aimed at the table so the hot water splashed on the viscount’s hands. The timid viscount didn’t make a sound when his hands getting burnt, he didn’t dare to fight against his wife. It was already ten years too late for him to retaliate in any way. From the way he dragged his limping leg to fetch damp towel for his scaling skin, it was clear the waiting servants already used to ignore him.</p>\n<p>Recently, his wife’s mood had became the worst ever since their youngest daughter came back from the two years seminars. Unlike Frane--who only registered as his son by blood in papers, Lyla hadn’t show any particular talents in becoming a Class worthy of a noble family. She had a decent progress speed, a Level 7 Novice after seminars, but that progress mainly because she never had the interest to train herself. Madam Blackwood had bribed the officials so Lyla could enter the seminars supposed to boost her standing in high society, so she could catch higher ranking nobles eyes somehow. However, that plan failed in the worst way that could happen to a noble family like the Blackwood. She made blunders and broke rules so many times that she became a laughing stock. The only families that interested in her only lower rank nobles and not-so well off merchant families.</p>\n<p>“There also no point keeping that useless girl forever in the mansion,” Madam Blackwood said. “Send her to Badril Village by tomorrow. Make some smart men tending to her needs--they have to smart enough to know how to reel those Malikh villagers to say yes when I send my words in the future!”</p>\n<p>After the son’s failure, the madam would send her daughter, to do nothing but play around in Malikh Family. Even if there was something the girl could do, the madam surely wouldn’t choose this daughter of hers who she deemed too brainless to do even the simplest tasks. Her daughter was just that useless to her. The one with received the orders were people who accompanied her, who had experience in bribing and coercing. They were tasked to devour Malikh Family from the inside. The Blackwood would surely corner Bhela Malikh this time.</p>\n<p>Somewhere else, in a colorless courtyard, a birthday party already went on for about two hours. Most guests already leaving, not unlike the year before the two-years seminars happened when the sons of noble families dallying around waiting for a chance to talk with the young lady. Today, the Young Lady of Blackwood Family turned fourteen, two years before she would considered mature, but this young miss still pouting her mouth like a little girl.</p>\n<p>The old handmaid saw her young lady was bored and offered a treat.</p>\n<p>“Young lady, try this cake. A certain famous bakery made this just for your birthday.”</p>\n<p>The cake served on a small plate along with a silver fork. The girl took only mere seconds to finish it.</p>\n<p>“Is it good?” the handmaid asked.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t matter if it’s good or not, Aunt Jiji, I still hungry with this tiny minny bit of cake! Let me eat that one!” the girl pointed at the layered cake served on the center of the party.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Lyla, you can’t!”</p>\n<p>“Why can’t I?!”</p>\n<p>“You must present yourself as a proper young lady, so you can’t!”</p>\n<p>The cake was to be portioned to serve for the same amount of guests since the last party, but because the Blackwood Family’s young lady had a bad reputation in the seminars, most invited families didn’t actually come.</p>\n<p>“But I can’t be a lady if I’m hungry, am I?”</p>\n<p>“You must learn the way. Be patient, Young Lady Lyla!”</p>\n<p>“But I am huuungriiiiieeeehhh!!!”</p>\n<p>Aunt Jiji was terrified when she realized the young lady wasn’t referred only to portion of the cake, but she wanted to eat the whole cake. This shorty girl, although her feature was thin with only her cheeks got plump, actually had a talent to be a terrifying glutton that would be seen in Tiramikal Continent every one hundred years. It was a useless talent that brought only shame to Blackwood Family.</p>\n<p>It was fortunate that before the young lady could make a big ruckus, a maidservant came to bring the news about the madam’s decision. Aunt Jiji passed it to the young lady immediately.</p>\n<p>“You heard that, young lady! Madam is going to send you for a vacation!”</p>\n<p>Lyla’s head straightened, she forgot to pout. “Vacation? Where? Where where?”</p>\n<p>“To Badril Village!”</p>\n<p>“Badril Village?” the girl tilted her head. “Where’s that?”</p>\n<p>“If you promise Aunt Jiji not to eat too much cake today, Aunt Jiji will tell you where it is…”</p>\n<p>“I will if it turned out somewhere fun!”</p>\n<p>“Badril Village is where Young Lady Bhela’s home place!”</p>\n<p>“Sis Bhela’s home?!” Lyla gasped, “yahoooo!!!”</p>\n<p>Ignoring that she was the center of attention, Lyla suddenly jumped and danced like no tomorrow. Aunt Jiji tried to stop her, but it was futile since Lyla only promised not to be glutton. The remaining guests began whispering with each other. They were people who doubted the rumors about this Young Lady Blackwood, but after seeing how childish and ridiculous the girl danced, people were finally convinced. How was this a viscount’s daughter supposed to act? The girl danced her hips and hopped around like a bunny that had an itchy bum. Soon, the Young Lady Lyla Blackwood fell to the bottom list of desired young ladies to marry. Her reputation fell from not-so-smart, to stupid, and then fell again to brainless and imbecile. People didn’t see her in a good light. But that just how a girl named Lyla Blackwood really was.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Yashura Family got a peculiar visitor these past two days. He introduced himself as an expert from overseas, and somehow this foreign expert became interested in Shira Yashura. When the story leaked by insiders from Yashura Family, people were scratching their heads, wondering what could an educated man saw from this trash who could only get himself to level 3 Novice. Some people even sneered, saying that whole news was just Yashura Family’s little trick to clear up rumors from their heir’s name.</p>\n<p>“You understand, kiddo? There are three mandatory rules if someone wants to meet privately with me. First rule, it’s a <em>she</em>, not <em>he</em>. Second rule, big boobs. Third rule, in her lower part, there must be big bubbly butts, as big as her boobs. <em>Anything</em> lesser than that you can just send them back to wherever they came from.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit said that as he moved his chess piece, eating one of Shira’s pawns.</p>\n<p>“And remember, my standard is pretty high. Consult with how loadful those girls from Big-Boobed Sect are for more information,” the Nalaq continued.</p>\n<p>“Please don’t talk nonsense. I’m being serious here,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“Ey, I’m not talking nonsense. The girls from Big-Boobed Sect are real deal, okay? They’re huge! If you don’t believe me then you should go to Elzhier Family one of these days, go check out how glorious their boobs are. They always dance or become the maidservants when they’re not on duties.”</p>\n<p>“Ol’ Good-Natured Spirit… I don’t want to hear this imaginary all-woman sect of yours. Elzhier Family is only a normal rural family, they don’t host any sect members within their walls. If they did, the Village Head would boast about it at my uncle’s face every single day.”</p>\n<p>“You just don’t believe it because you never see how great they are--their boobs, I mean. How great those melons inside tight suits are! Just think about it; leather suits and melons--two entirely different things but if they come together they’d jiggling in harmony. This Good-Natured Spirit approved their sense of style.”</p>\n<p>“Forget about it, it’s not important--”</p>\n<p>“Boobs are important, ey!”</p>\n<p>Shira waved his hand as he didn’t want to continue this nonsense. He then moved a piece and finished his turn. He returned the topic back again, “The expert said he came from a first-tier faction called Blue Robe Society. If we can get his faction’s recognition then at least my family can silence all those rumors about me--especially the recent ones, they really are becoming a pain in the ass.”</p>\n<p>“I told you. I don’t talk with guys. No boobs, no good. Period.”</p>\n<p>“You are really becoming a pain in the ass,” Shira complained.</p>\n<p>After Shira said that, Good-Natured Spirit’s knight jumped over a wall of pawns to get on his bishop. Within a single breath Shira immediately moved his rook, creating a chain reaction that exposes the Nalaq’s defence, resulting his king trapped in three different direction.</p>\n<p>“Check mate.”</p>\n<p>“Ey, what the fu--” Good-Natured Spirit rage quit, flipping the chess board. “Hah! I knew it! You brat, you intentionally make me talk about boobs in order to lower my guard, right?! Fuck! That is how it is, isn’t it?!”</p>\n<p>“No, it is not.”</p>\n<p>“You sneaky bastard. You really got me,” Good-Natured Spirit threw his hands up in the air. <br>\n“Man, I surrender, that is some sick psychological tactic you got there.”</p>\n<p>“Now I don’t really know what you’re talking about.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit waved his hands in surrender, then he lit a cigarette. “Anyway, what do you want from me this time? Money again? I prepared some kobe coins enough for you to buy some candy, here, take this.”</p>\n<p>Shira shoved back the coin bag. “Not today. I just want you to meet Sir Baront Staterwind.”</p>\n<p>“No boobs, no good. Ask something else. How about I tell you the secret place where are those Big-Boobed Sect girls take their bath, ‘ey? Seems fair deal to me.”</p>\n<p>“How many times do I have to tell you--”</p>\n<p>“Sssshhh!!” Good-Natured Spirit hushed the boy. He then whispered, “you hear that?”</p>\n<p>Because the Nalaq suddenly became vigilant, Shira instinctively lowered his voice too. “Hear what?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“I heard some rats watching us…” the Nalaq covered his mouth, as if he didn’t want people to read lips what he said next, “some big-boobed rats…”</p>\n<p>“Huh… what?”</p>\n<p>“The girls from Big-Boobed Sect… they’re here…”</p>\n<p>“The heck are you talking about? This hill is Yashura Family’s property--”</p>\n<p>“Sssshhhh! They’ve noticed me noticing them. Wait here, I’mma get you some melons for your reward!”</p>\n<p>After he saying that, Good-Natured Spirit’s figure melting into the thin air.</p>\n<p>Shira Yashura sighed. At times, asking favor to this vulgar Nalaq not only difficult, it also unpredictable he’d only incite troubles if he not careful.</p>\n<p>After his winning streak for more than half a year maybe he became cocky. He forgot the Nalaq wasn’t there to solve his problem whenever he wanted, although the Nalaq sort of ended up like that after a few months he came here. Shira got some thinking, maybe he should stop seeing this Nalaq as his convenient piggy bank for his own good.</p>\n<p>“Really, he always making a mess for me to clean. I wonder if such thoughtless Nalaqs like him are common around here… now, where’s the last piece again?” he sighed for the second time.</p>\n<p>When he was picking up chess pieces that board Good-Natured Spirit flipped earlier, Shira realized there was a missing piece. Turned out it was stuck in the hole between tree roots.</p>\n<p>He plunged his hand to look for the missing chess piece.</p>\n<p>“Ugh… my fingers can’t reach.”</p>\n<p>He tried to squirm his body to fit his hand in.</p>\n<p>“Where is it again?”</p>\n<p>He frowned. He squirmed his body again really hard.</p>\n<p>“Oh, there it--”</p>\n<p><em>BOOOOOMMMMM!!!!</em></p>\n<p>An explosion happened not far away from the place he used to hang out, creating a wave of rolling dust that swept over the hill. Shira got his hand stuck between the tree rots, he could only hugged his head with his free hand and waited for the shockwave to finish. The chess pieces he gathered already nowhere to be found. He cooked up his head, looking left and right, and saw the greeny grasses were covered with dirts and trees were uprooted. The whole hill became a shithole kind of mess.</p>\n<p>Before the boy could swallow what was going on, a chuckle could be heard near him. Before him, Good-Natured Spirit emerged, coiling around the Nalaq’s body were purple-colored living flames that hungrily tried to eat him whole.</p>\n<p>As carefree as he usually was, Good-Natured Spirit said with a grin, “Those Big-Boobed Sect girls sure are feisty. They’re escaping too fast, I can’t get you melons. I managed to get a feeling of their butts, though. Here, there’s some fragrant left behind.”</p>\n<p>Shira stepped back when the Nalaq offered his palm. It was still on fire, the boy didn’t want to get burn along with him. Besides, he didn’t want to get involved with the Nalaq’s deprived hobby.</p>\n<p>“Sure you don’t want it?” Good-Natured Spirit took a last sniff from his palm, followed by a low chuckle of his.</p>\n<p>“Good-Natured Spirit… what’s that fire?”</p>\n<p>“Yeah? Dunno, man. Exorcism flame or something.”</p>\n<p>“Ohh… oh, it’s very nice to know you up until know. Good bye.”</p>\n<p>“Hmm? You want to go somewhere?” Realizing the purple flame was getting annoying, Good-Natured Spirit then patted away the coiling flame from his shoulders like it was nothing.</p>\n<p>Shira shrugged his shoulders. It seemed this bastard Nalaq was too tough for that exorcism flame. Maybe the flame was too ordinary? Whatever, he didn’t care about that anymore. His eyes then swept the ruin around him. He said, “You can’t forget about the meeting for today. But please clean the mess you made yourself.”</p>\n<p>“That’s what you want for the chess reward?”</p>\n<p>Shira nodded.</p>\n<p>“Aye, aye, will do.” Good-Natured Spirit flicked his fingers, and human-sized paper cranes came out of thin air. They were obedient, not clear whether were monsters or just magical devices. The paper cranes used magnet-like magic to carry the messy uprooted trees and boulders, along with sweeping the dirt from the grass. The cleaning up might take a while, since the hill really was a mess. Shira, feeling a little light on the head, facepalming as he returned back to Yashura Family.</p>\n<p>The whole explosion could be heard from all over Badril Village. It wasn’t clear what its cause, but Yashura Family sent guards to prevent people from knowing what really happened. In Yashura Family’s guest hall, Patriarch Shuro Yashura, a few good Yashura Family elders, and the respected visitor, Sir Baront Staterwind, forming a circle as they sat cross-legged, discussing the explosion that had just occurred.</p>\n<p>“Good elders, Sir Patriarch Yashura, I know you must get excited when I said Young Master Shira has some talent in communicating with Nalaqs. However, a Nalaq still a Nalaq. You must not offend a Nalaq whatsoever, or the consequence is dire! Young Master Shira’s life is way more important than getting a qualification to enter my school!” Sir Baront Staterwind warned. His forehead was still wet with sweat, since he hurriedly ran to Yashura Family when he realized the direction of recent explosion.</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, you’re right, Sir Staterwind. Absolutely right! I already sent someone to check on my nephew’s condition, please calm down,” Patriarch Shuro said.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront shook his head. “You don’t really know what I’m trying to say, do you? You should prepare a very good healer or a doctor, Patriarch Shuro, because if it isn’t death, one can easily lose a limb over angering a Nalaq! That happens more often than you think!”</p>\n<p>The elders drew cold breaths in unison when they heard that. Patriarch Shuro, whose face already pale, becoming even whiter than a sheet of paper. If they boy lost a limb, Shira’s chance to succeed him as the next patriarch could be swept away like specks of dust.</p>\n<p>Yulong the Butler arrived. Everyone in the room had been anxiously waiting for him they instinctively stood up when Yulong approached.</p>\n<p>“Yulong, how’s Shira doing?” Patriarch Shuro asked.</p>\n<p>Yulong replied, “Young Master Shira is back, patriarch. But Madam Yashura sent him to the kitchen for a second breakfast.”</p>\n<p>“Breakfast? What’s a breakfast has something to do with that explosion? Can he still walk?”</p>\n<p>“He’s walking fine, Patriarch Yashura.”</p>\n<p>“Then, Yulong, please go fetch my nephew for me, we have something urgent to tell him!”</p>\n<p>After his trained elegant bow, Yulong stepped back and proceeded to do the task given to him.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront Staterwind peered at the butler’s back. He traveled southern lands many times, visiting many villages, yet, he seldom heard a Mossack descent major family employed western-style butler. What made him confused even more that Sir Kurusiya apparently knew the butler and gave his respect to him, which Sir Baront Staterwind didn’t expect that coming from the cold eastern Kaya swordsman.</p>\n<p>“Dear good elder,” Sir Baront Staterwind asked a random elder who sat beside him, “may I know why there’s a butler working here?”</p>\n<p>“Is Sir referring to Yulong? Yulong isn’t actually working for Yashura Family, but Young Master Shira’s mother’s attendant. I can’t tell you the details, so forgive me sir, all I can say is Young Master Shira’s father is exceedingly brave and awesome he managed to woo a respectable lady many years ago.”</p>\n<p>“Ahhh…” Sir Baront nodded. The boy apparently a result of his parent eloping. The Blue Robe Society expert of course knew etiquette to hold himself from digging the story further.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, Yulong came back with Shira followed behind. The boy wore new clothes since his previous one was dirty. When he saw the group of elders and the expert guest looking at him, Shira sighed inside his heart. He knew he had to clean Good-Natured Spirit’s mess once again.</p>\n<p>“Greetings, elders… greetings, uncle patriarch… greetings, Sir Staterwind…”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro impatiently treading forward. “Shira my boy, is it true that you lost your limbs?”</p>\n<p>“I’m unhurt, uncle, see?” Shira waved both of his hands to prove that his limbs still functioned as they should be.</p>\n<p>“Oh! God, thank God! Really! These are really your hands, aren’t they? Not a fake one made with wood?” Patriarch Shuro Yashura grabbed his nephew hands and waved it around like a child playing with flags.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira,” Sir Baront opened his mouth, “I reckon you failed to ask the Nalaq to meet me? If you can’t do it, young master, it best for you not to push him any further. Today, you offend him and he blast the hill behind your Yashura Family as a warning, but what happens if you make the same mistake tomorrow?”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro nodded at his words vigorously. “Sir Baront is right, Shira my boy. A Nalaq is a revered being ancient Mossacks worshiped as their guardian angel. The consequence of making them mad is very dire! You should know better, my boy, you should’ve told your uncle if a Nalaq came to you the first time!”</p>\n<p>Sir Baront and his uncle Patriarch Shuro had good intentions in telling him about how to be respectful to a Nalaq. But the more Shira heard their warning, the more he doubted about Good-Natured Spirit being a “revered” Nalaq like they said. Of course, saying the truth about the explosion’s true cause resulting only Yashura Family losing face in front of Sir Baront Staterwind. Shira had no choice, he had to tread the matter very carefully.</p>\n<p>“<em>Cough, cough</em>… Uncle, Sir Baront, thank you for your concern. Truth is, it wasn’t that the Nalaq being mad that causes the explosion, but there was some… accident… that happened right before.”</p>\n<p>“With what title do you usually call him, Young Master Shira?” Sir Baront asked.</p>\n<p>“As far as I know, he doesn’t have a title. At least he didn’t tell me if he ever had one. He told me to call him ‘Good-Natured Spirit’.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, with that kind of nickname, he must be a very benevolent person when he was alive,” Sir Baront concluded as he rubbed his beard. “So, Young Master Shira, it seems he didn’t really intent to blast into smithereens.”</p>\n<p>Shira nodded. That part was true. Instead, someone else happened to be intending to blast this Nalaq into smithereens.</p>\n<p>“Thank God! Thank God! If he is a good Nalaq, maybe we don’t need to throw the second ngajen ceremony for this month, after all!” Patriarch Shuro Yashura exclaimed. The elders in the guest hall followed his exclaiming by handclapping and joyful cries. Ngajen ceremony only held once a month so the village safe from angry Selaqs, no one ever tried it to protect themselves from intelligent Nalaqs. Since the village was founded, the locals never had a Nalaq dwelling there. So it was natural for the elders to worry about throwing a ceremony they didn’t know working or not. Ngajen ceremony was expensive, after all.</p>\n<p>The more Shira saw how the previous tense hall turned jubilant and full of relieved faces, the more awkward he became. That Nalaq might call himself ‘Good-Natured Spirit’, yet he was anything but good. A low-life spirit who no doubt had been using the invisibility traits of spirits to commit many deprived crimes. He was closer to evil spirit incarnation than a good-natured one. The misunderstanding was too great his face twisted as if he’d just taste a sour lemon.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront Staterwind said, “Still, since he seems reluctant to use his old name, I reckon the Nalaq that approaching you is a low-tier one, Young Master Shira. Low-tier Nalaqs usually spirits that gain consciousness merely by luck. They don’t have factions backing them, and fortunately--in my experience--it easier to initiate negotiation with unaffiliated Nalaqs.” A hint of pride then flashed through his eyes, he continued, “my disciples will arrive tomorrow morning. One of them contracted with a high-tier Nalaq. Since the Nalaq’s mood turned sour is partly my fault, with help from the Nalaq contracted with one of my disciples, I will ask him to leave Yashura Family peacefully!”</p>\n<p>“Sir Staterwind is wise! Thank you for your concern, Sir!” Patriarch Shuro sang praises toward this expert. The elders of Yashura Family followed suit.</p>\n<p>“As expected of such expert!”</p>\n<p>“Sir Staterwind is the best of bunch of all experts that I know all my life!”</p>\n<p>“Hurray for Sir Staterwind!”</p>\n<p>They circling Sir Baront Staterwind and, not long after that, someone started to prostate. They behaved as if the guest was their one and only savior. Even Shira was getting embarrassed from seeing the scene, not to mention the already flushing Baront Staterwind.</p>\n<p>When everyone getting carried away, Shira slipped out after excusing himself. He knew he was no match for the Yashura Family’s older generations’ shamelessness. Upon walking outside, he saw Yulong was standing by the hall’s door looking galant as usual with his butler professionalism.</p>\n<p>“Can you please try to stop my uncle, Yulong? Sir Staterwind is started to get uncomfortable there.”</p>\n<p>Yulong glanced at the whole mess inside, and then he said to his young master, “I think it’s not everyday an expert coming to Yashura Family, young master, so let’s count this as Patriarch Yashura to gaining favors from a foreign expert.”</p>\n<p>“Are they really okay, though?”</p>\n<p>Yulong smiled.</p>\n<p>“Of course they aren’t, young master. But Patriarch Shuro and the family elders are honest people. Although sometimes they can be overwhelming, I’m sure Sir Staterwind can see no falsehood in their words.”</p>\n<p>Shira looked at those elders inside once again. The more he saw, the more he realized that those hysterical village men calling a man they barely knew these past two days a savior by no means a lie from their part. The elders really were freaking out when they heard the explosion. And Patriarch Shuro Yashura was the most worried of the bunch, considering him a patriarch and an uncle. Thinking about it all again, Shira couldn’t really say he still embarrassed seeing the elders spewing exaggerated flattering with straight faces.</p>\n<p>“Sir Staterwind comes from a respectable sect. Someone like that won’t get to travel the southern lands if he didn’t know the nature of the local people. So it best not to worry about it too much, young master,” Yulong said.</p>\n<p>“Really… ah, speaking of sects,” Shira deliberately changed the topic, “I heard from someone that one of the major families in Badril Village hosts members of a certain sect in secret. You’re from outside, Yulong--do you think something so outrageous like that could happen?”</p>\n<p>“Some older sects have long reaching influence, but I don’t think anyone would be interested to plant their own in Badril Village. There’s nothing valuable here for them to take notice.”</p>\n<p>“As I thought. It’s just unthinkable to think some secret powers lurking beneath our everyday lives. What if some experts actually pretending to be servants here in Yashura Family?”</p>\n<p>Although it wasn’t noticeable, Yulong’s smile became stiff.</p>\n<p>“You jest, young master. If that was true, do you think your uncle and the elders can take that kind of truth?”</p>\n<p>Following Yulong’s gaze, Shira peeped the hall and saw Sir Baront’s awkward figure, where he was in the center of Yashura Family elites--all of them-- who passionately prostrating in the floor. They practically worshipping him now.</p>\n<p>“You’re right…” Shira could only hide his face with his palm. Just when he thought he could understand them, the boy then wished he didn’t know these shameless men.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>As far as the current generation of Badril Village locals knew, they never got visited by nobles until this month Malikh Family’s ngajen ceremony happened. Everyone still talking about it.</p>\n<p>Young Master of Blackwood Family only stayed in Badril Village in one day. And the noble carriage of Blackwood Family set off out of Badril Village by noon. The next morning after the day he was gone, the two foreign guests who had been staying in Malikh Family, Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia, felt overstaying might be unnecessary, thus decided to leave too.</p>\n<p>Because the carriages going out from Badril Village mostly for public transports, Bhela personally asked an elder from his father’s faction who had a horse carriage to give her guests a ride to the nearest town, where they’d later book a private carriage for them to return home. Mister Harrington, as an unsocial bachelor as he always was, was waiting in the carriage for Madame Sylvia to say her parting words to Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>“You have a very bright future, Young Lady Bhela. A girl with limitless potential. So your favor will become very valuable as you mature,” Madame Sylvia said. “If you need something, you can always send letters to my sect. Don’t hold back. Just think about this of us making an investment.”</p>\n<p>Since Bhela a smart girl anyway, Madame Sylvia decided not to make her words fancy and told her in a straightforward manner. Bhela appreciated her honesty, and said her thanks.</p>\n<p>The carriage then set off. In the main gate of Badril Village, the guards on duty witnessed the recently blazing popular Young Lady Bhela Malikh bowing her body as she sent off two foreigners in traveling clothes made from expensive linen.</p>\n<p>“Look at how she is,” inside the carriage, Madame Sylvia said to Mister Harrington. “She’s a pretty sensible girl, don’t you think?”</p>\n<p>“She is,” Mister Harrington said softly, almost a murmur.</p>\n<p>It was hard to start a conversation whenever Mister Harrington sat with his arms crossed tightly. Madame Sylvia could see that he wasn’t exactly happy with the outcome regarding Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>There was no bandits lurking around, and no monsters occasionally came out, proved that the lands around Badril Village actually well-protected--too well, perhaps, for a rural village without a major power backing them. Their journey was smooth without disturbance. Thirty minutes after they left Badril Village, they encountered another carriage painted with black-jet color. The black carriage was well-decorated with golden-colored plates, obviously elites or nobles were traveling inside.</p>\n<p>However, unlike common nobles who liked to hide in the carriage to show-off their elegance and aloofness, this carriage simply out of commonsense. To talk about how weird this carriage was there was a need to point out the refreshing greenness of the view around. Despite there being a road far away from settlement, hint of liveliness from bird chirping--along with croaking frogs from nearby streams and singing insects--completed the idyllic road with a strange harmony that invited light-hearted person to sing along with lively nature. That was exactly what the noble in the black carriage doing. A young lady with a very girly and childish feature was carefreely sitting in the window in spite of pale servants begging her to sit still. She completely dumb about the servants’ pleas. And with her personality, nobody knew whether she was pretending or not. The only thing that the jubilant Lyla Blackwood cared about was singing an off-tune song about her befriending village frogs and bunnies.</p>\n<p>“Prepare your life you frogs and bunnies~</p>\n<p>Cause I’m not letting you go before we become the best of buddies~~</p>\n<p>Wait for me you birdies and kitties~~</p>\n<p>Cause we’re about to become the best of all buddies~~ yuhuu~ yuhuu~~</p>\n<p>The best buddies in this lifetime~~ yuhuuuu~~~”</p>\n<p>There was nothing the servants and the guards could do to stop their young lady from singing this amazingly ugly song about her future exploits in Badril Village. Seeing that another carriage approaching, the horse-riding guards did their best to block the view to the crest planted on the carriage’s compartment. Their effort to save faces from the young lady’s mishap was futile, however, since the other party happened to know Lyla.</p>\n<p>“How many times have I told you to stay away from windows, Lyla!”</p>\n<p>“Whu--what? Who?” Lyla was surprised. But then she was elated to see a familiar face. “Is that you, Instructor Sylvia? You here to train Sis Bhela’s archery again?”</p>\n<p>“Get down from the window!” Madame Sylvia raised her voice.</p>\n<p>“I’m also here to meet Sis Bhela!” Lyla also raised her voice cheerfully.</p>\n<p>“Lyla, you won’t be able to get married in the future if you’re always act like this!” Madame Sylvia warned her. She long dropped title of Young Lady Blackwood when talking to this naughty girl.</p>\n<p>“Um!” Lyla nodded. “But which one do you like more, Instructor Sylvia, bunnies or kitties?” It was no use trying to talk sense to Lyla. Any warning only come to her right ear and gone out straight from the left one.</p>\n<p>“Stay away from the windows!!!” Madame Sylvia screamed until her voice shrilled.</p>\n<p>Lyla also screamed, “Good morning to you too!!!”</p>\n<p>Both carriages drifted apart after the brief encounter. It ended with Lyla happily waved her hands happily. Madame Sylvia sighed and shook her head. That girl was so naughty that the troubles she created made the seminars’ managements even considered to drop her once during the seminars. Only after Bhela Malikh convinced them she’d take care of Lyla they finally did let go the matter.</p>\n<p>Before, the black carriage of Blackwood Family came to Badril Village in the shroud of night’s darkness, so nobody noticed their elegance and the aura of expensive carriage blazing through the village road--of which was surprisingly wide for a settlement road, unlike road of cities in the western kingdoms, because long ago Mossack people needed to endure monster stampedes passing through their villages once every few months.</p>\n<p>“Mom, look, is that a noble?” a snotty kid pointing out the carriage.</p>\n<p>The mother hurriedly pulled her child. “Ssuuussh! Keep your finger to yourself! Don’t you know what happened to peasants that make noble angry from the stories they always talking about?”</p>\n<p>The steel-armored guards who escort the carriage scoffed them in disdain. Contrast with the escorts’ attitudes, Lyla waved her hand at them, while shouting, “Hey boy, don’t you think bunnies are cute as the kitties? Or do you like cats more?”</p>\n<p>The kid didn’t answer. He instead forced to bow by her mother and let the carriage went through silently. The villagers didn’t have the experience in receiving nobles, most of them--except for those who attended the ngajen ceremony in Malikh Family--had never saw nobles in their lives. Because of that they were awkward and didn’t know what to do.</p>\n<p>Lyla didn’t seem to mind their stiffness. Instead, she vigorously greeted everyone she saw from the window she sat on.</p>\n<p>“Good day! Good morning! I’m here to sleepover at Sis Bhela’s place! Do you know where Sis Bhela lives?”</p>\n<p>Back in Elzhier Family, in the main family’s house, their patriarch, hurriedly changed his clothes to a formal one he always used every ngajen ceremony.</p>\n<p>“Hurry, hurry! As the head of this village, how can I let a noble arriving without me receiving them?!”</p>\n<p>Not even he yet buttoned his shirt properly, the Village Head sprinted toward the main street, only to see the crowd of onlookers already dispersed and still talking about the scary nobles they always heard in stories were actually <em>weirdly</em> friendly.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Bhela Malikh was already notified about Lyla Blackwood’s arrival. She waited on a chair at the Malikh Family’s gate, drinking a fresh young coconut water occasionally. The black carriage finally was in her view. And the young girl she was waiting for happily waved her hand at her. From the window.</p>\n<p>“Carefull, Lyla!” Bhela yelled as she sprang from her chair.</p>\n<p>“Huuupp!” Lyla Blackwood simply didn’t want to waste anytime leaving the carriage through the door. So she simply jumped from the window she sat upon, before the carriage even stopped. It was fortunate that amongst Bhela’s skill as a Unique Class, she had <b>Haste</b>, which boosted her speed in short duration. She used that to catch Lyla before she hurt herself. The young noble girl landed splendidly in Bhela’s arm.</p>\n<p>“What’s this, Sistah?” Lyla’s eyes sparkled when she saw Bhela get a young coconut in her other hand. She was completely oblivious she just did something dangerous.</p>\n<p>“Young coconut. There’s still some of its water left. Here, try this,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“For me? Really?”</p>\n<p>“Drink slowly…”</p>\n<p><em>Glug glug glug</em>. Lyla drank the coconut in anything but in slowly manner. She even burped shamelessly.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Lyla, ah!” the butler who coming with her was in horror seeing how Young Lady Lyla Blackwood made a horrible mess by spilling the coconut water on her expensive, silk woven black dress. Only an equally expensive silk handkerchief worthy enough to wipe his young lady’s noble dress!</p>\n<p>“I told you to drink slowly…” Bhela said. She used her sleeve to wipe Lyla’s wet face, and then proceeded to also wipe Lyla’s dress.</p>\n<p>“Y-young miss!” the butler shouted in panic. His body jolted as soon as he saw the outrageous act of spoiling the young noble’s dress by making it contacted with commoner clothes. That was heresy! He needed her to stop before she contained Blackwood’s expensive dress with her commoner’s bacteria!</p>\n<p>“You need something?” Bhela looked at this unfamiliar butler of Blackwood Family. Her expressionless face judged the butler coldly.</p>\n<p>“My name is Tim, young miss--please use this!” the butler offered a silky smooth handkerchief with Blackwood Family’s crest embroidered on the surface. The handkerchief was actually the butler’s, was awarded to his great-great-great grandfather by the then Baron Blackwood for some sort of achievement that practically nobody was still alive to remember. Everytime Butler Tim met a new person, he’d make an excuse to show off this particular handkerchief. Today was no exception. It was his most precious handkerchief. Just from the look of it one could tell how crazy expensive it was.</p>\n<p>“Ah, ah… my nose… aahhh--” Lyla felt her nose was wet and itchy, “--ahhtchii!!!”</p>\n<p>“You’ve got a flu?” Bhela asked worriedly.</p>\n<p>“Yeah. Aunt Jiji told me to drink my medicine everyday but it’s so bitter. So much bitter that it’s evil!”</p>\n<p>“Where’s your medicine now?”</p>\n<p>“Oh. I throw it away last night.”</p>\n<p>Bhela shook her head.</p>\n<p>“That’s no good. You can’t throw away your medicine like that. Now, wipe your nose. This mister butler said to use this…” she put the handkerchief on Lyla’s nose, and Lyla blew her nose on it.</p>\n<p>Lyla gave back the handkerchief to Butler Tim. “Thank you, Sir Butler. It’s very helpful of you.”</p>\n<p>The butler received back his most precious handkerchief. Bonus Lyla’s snot.</p>\n<p>“Come on inside,” Bhela said to Lyla. “Even if the water runs dry, coconuts still have meat we can scoop. After that we’ll pick some star fruits that I planted since I was a child.”</p>\n<p>“Star fruits! Woohooo!”</p>\n<p>The girls then walked inside. Lyla was so excited she didn’t leave her friend, hanging on her neck like a koala being comfortable on a tree branch. The stories about a noble young lady coming to Malikh Family for Bhela Malikh spread amongst the maidservants like oil being poured on an open wildfire. The Malikhs couldn’t describe the pride seeing their eldest young lady with a blue blood friend. Especially the aunties. They watched how close Bhela and Lyla with teary eyes and happy smiles.</p>\n<p>“Young lady is… finally… finally…”</p>\n<p>“She finally has a friend…”</p>\n<p>“Huuu… huuu… merciful Goddesses finally saw the young lady’s plight and blessed her with a real friend… huuu huuuu….”</p>\n<p>Nobody more happier than the aunties who were familiar with how their Young Lady Bhela lived her live. They silently cried watching their young lady, who usually alone and unapproachable, finally grown up and had her first friend in these past ten years.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Butler Tim grimaced inside. Despite the fact that he was tasked to win over Bhela Malikh with any means necessary, he didn’t like this girl. It wasn’t because his handkerchief got dirty--well, maybe he resented her for it a little--it because the girl named Bhela Malikh wasn’t acting as a young country girl supposed to act. Country bumpkins supposed to falter when they saw the radiance seeped out of the nobles’ aura, they supposed to tremble when they saw the noble wealth glittering beneath the sun. But this girl was indifferent and aloof. She was cold but the coldness paired with concise and elegant mannerism. Butler Tim knew she trying to act noble herself. That was why he didn’t like her.</p>\n<p>However, Butler Tim was a smart person. Any smart person would wear a perfect smile despite his heart bleeding over the snot on his precious handkerchief. Before leaving the city, the butler didn’t forget to look for a gift he’d use to lower the Malikh Family’s guard. He heard the previous gift was rejected, and when he asked for the content of the gift, the smart Butler Tim shook his head as if he knew it would happen.</p>\n<p>Toward country bumpkins, too expensive gifts would never work. He knew this because he was smart. And because he was smart, he knew better gifts. Not-so-expensive gifts worked for country bumpkins.</p>\n<p>Therefore, he presented Bhela Malikh with popular city biscuits.</p>\n<p>“I heard this biscuit is currently very popular among noble young ladies. This butler happened to pass by a store that sold this, so I reckon Young Lady Bhela might love to taste some.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, because the elders roughly knew the Blackwood Family’s youngest lady would come to visit, two leaders of opposing factions came to watch how their Young Lady Bhela would receive the noble guest. Elder Jhamil was all smiling because he liked what he saw. But the expression of Elder Khasim turned sour when he saw how the butler of Blackwood Family tried to butter up to Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>“Don’t accept it, young lady, please….” Elder Khasim whispered under his breath. Of course, there was no single soul heard what he just said. He was worried the hard work to rebuild his faction’s morale all would turn into dust if people thought their spiritual mascot, the one and only Young Lady Bhela Malikh, could be bought with mere biscuits.</p>\n<p>Contrary to what Elder Khasim hoped, Bhela Malikh received the gift without even putting a second thought. A feeling of defeat surged inside him. Elder Jhamil looked at his rival with a mocking glance.</p>\n<p>After receiving the snacks, Bhela excused herself and brought Lyla with her to stroll around Malikh Family’s gardens. Butler Tim pretended to wave his hand and smiled, but inside, he was gloating at how hypocrite Bhela was. His guess that Young Lady Bhela wouldn’t refuse the gift he brought was entirely correct. Before, he deliberately said the biscuit was noble young ladies’ favorite. Thus, according to his smart logic, as long as it wasn’t too expensive that it’d scare this fake young lady, no way a noble wannabe would reject this kind of gifts.</p>\n<p>“Heh,” Butler Tim scoffed when Bhela and Lyla already left. “Bet you’ve never eaten any city biscuits your entire life, haven’t you.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, Bhela Malikh hadn’t had any city biscuits her entire life. Not before and also not today. What Butler Tim didn’t know was that the snacks he bought with his own money ultimately ended up returned to Blackwood Family--to be exact, it ended up inside Lyla Blackwood’s belly. Bhela couldn’t help but received the biscuits when, beside her, she saw Lyla was drooling looking at the biscuits.</p>\n<p>The elders led by Elder Jhamil then respectfully welcomed the butler along with servants and guards from Blackwood Family. From the impression alone, Butler Tim could see reasons for him to like this slick-tongued Elder Jhamil. He knew how to flatter and also he knew how to act humble in front of people with higher status than him. Not like that noble-wannabe Young Lady of Malikh Family. This Elder Jhamil knew that he was only a country bumpkin thus acted accordingly. Naturally, the smart Butler Tim was pleased.</p>\n<p>And so began Butler Tim’s quests to swallow Malikh Family with his smartly planned schemes and cunning political games.</p>\n<p>In mere hours, the neutral elders who hadn’t joined either both rivalling factions began flocking to Elder Jhamil’s side. One part because they wanted to side with the faction that had the noble support and another part simply because Elder Jhamil, with the help of Butler Tim, had been throwing around sweet deals over all directions.</p>\n<p>“Only one tenth of the elder council members don’t want to pick a side by now, but their number is too significant to be an obstacle for Sir Butler’s great plan,” Elder Jhamil reported the current situation to Butler Tim.</p>\n<p>The butler was enjoying a glass of tea served by the maid that supposed to serve Young Lady Lyla Blackwood as if he was the visiting noble himself. He nodded. “I see. With this, the first stage of my plan has been completed.”</p>\n<p>“Oohhh!” Elder Jhamil exclaimed. “Sir Butler summoned rain and fire by flipping Malikh Family’s political scene upside down, and this is only the first stage?! As expected, the Butler of Blackwood Family is very smart!”</p>\n<p>Butler Tim originally wanted to act aloof and sophisticated before he visited this rural village. However, upon being called a smart person, he couldn’t help but grinned widely. “Oho, you’re an interesting fella, aren’t you? Very well, since you’ve done a good job yourself, I won’t be so petty to grab all the credit. Tell me how I should do next, if I like what I hear, we might as well corporate your thoughts into my plan.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was excited. How could he not? An opportunity to rise beyond a mere elder of rural village was laid before him.</p>\n<p>“Sir Butler, you may not know this, but we Mossack people regard having a good meal very highly. Everytime we’re having breakfast or dinner together as the entire family, even though we’re always looked peaceful outside, those trivial events actually are a political battlefield for us elders to extend our influence! This lowly man himself used a few move in the past during breakfast to gather like-minded men under my banner. I used all my resources and connections in a single mealtime to attack my rivals! However, these past two days, my biggest rival used a lowly method against me…”</p>\n<p>“Oh? What did he do?” Butler Tim asked.</p>\n<p>“He didn’t do much,” Elder Jhamil said, sneering when he was talking about this rival of his, “all he did was inviting Young Lady Bhela everytime we were having a meal in the family hall. He’s been a stubborn and ignorant supporter of main family, but this time he actually knew how to use his connection with the main family to deal a blow against me. A few of the elders had been faltering when they saw Young Lady Bhela leaning over the other side; I’m afraid if we’re leaving this ignorant rival of me doing as he wanted, there’s gonna be a hole in Sir Butler’s smart plan!”</p>\n<p>Butler Tim swirled the tea in his cup as though he was deep in thought. Of course, if this proven to endanger his smart plan, the butler couldn’t sit still watching all that happened. “I heard the Mossacks are peculiar people, but I don’t know you Mossack people have a strange custom!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, we’re living here far away from the city, so of course our traditions might seem unsophisticated to wise westerners like Sir Butler,” Elder Jhamil fawned.</p>\n<p>“Then what do you suggest Blackwood Family should do in this situation, Elder Jhamil?”</p>\n<p>“It’s easy!” Elder Jhamil was so excited he almost jumped from his seat. “My rival faction used Young Lady Bhela to gain foothold, and we can also use that to deal a greater blow back to them!”</p>\n<p>“And that is?”</p>\n<p>“Of course, we can use--I mean, we can invite young noble miss to a dinner together with us. With this we can unofficially announce our alliance with Blackwood Family! It’s the final nail to main family’s faction!”</p>\n<p>Even though Bhela Malikh’s status as a Unique Class shone throughout all of Badril Village, her name still fall short with a pure noble like Lyla Blackwood. Madam back in Blackwood Family used her daughter so Blackwood could infiltrate Malikh Family easily, but that didn’t mean Lyla still wasn’t as useful.</p>\n<p>“Very well. Let us go with that,” then he asked the maid responsible for Lyla’s schedule. “What was Young Lady Lyla doing this afternoon?”</p>\n<p>The maid replied, “Young Lady Bhela Malikh carried her around to play. At first, they went to Malikh Family’s orchard to pick some fruits. Then they visited the sick Patriarch Malikh in his room for a few minutes. After that, they went outside to stroll and came back with a new rabbit pet they bought from other family. Finally, when the sun is setting, they went to the kitchen to watch the servants cooking.”</p>\n<p>“How uncouth for a noble young lady being led around in dirty places like that,” Butler Tim was displeased, but nothing he could do since making Bhela’s attention elsewhere meant he could move freely to make a trap for her. Nodding to himself, the butler then gave an instruction to the maid, “you go to Young Lady Lyla and tell that Malikh Family invite her for a dinner.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was excitedly rubbing his hands when Butler Tim said that. Finally, payback to those imbecile Elder Khasim!</p>\n<p>“But, Butler Tim…” the maid hesitated.</p>\n<p>“What is it?”</p>\n<p>“Malikh Family already invited Young Lady Lyla to have dinner. She’s eating in Malikh Family’s hall right now….”</p>\n<p>“Hmm, what do you mean?”</p>\n<p>What the maid meant was that someone in Malikh Family already brought Lyla to have dinner with them.</p>\n<p>When Butler Tim playing political games and scheming around in Malikh Family, Bhela Malikh, along with the elders friendly with Elder Khasim, had been giving bunch of candies and food for Lyla Blackwood, much more than the biscuits Butler Tim brought with him. Being a great foodie herself, Lyla never had enough, the first day in Malikh Family she ate more sweets and foods worth of one week back in Blackwood Family’s manor. Aunt Jiji and other Blackwood Family’s maid servants would freak out if they saw how glutton Lyla currently was.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the news that the main family’s faction hosting a dinner for a noble miss swept Malikh Family like a thunderstorm. The neutral elders Elder Jhamil had just bought flocking back toward Elder Khasim’s side. It was so sudden. Everyone wasn’t even got a breath to process what had happened. And this for sure was an unprecedented move ever since Patriarch Ghalim suddenly fell ill and retreated from the political scene.</p>\n<p>Just as one side was busy completing the first stage to win over the Young Lady of Malikh Family, the other side already won over Young Lady of the noble Blackwood Family. All happened in a span of a single day.</p>\n<p>“Y-young Lady Lyla…”</p>\n<p>Even Butler Tim couldn’t pull his own young miss seeing how happy she was. His plan had been jabbed in a completely unexpected way. Maybe he wasn’t so smart after all.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>It was unfortunate that Madam Malikh didn’t see the Young Noble Miss of Blackwood Family kindly. Even though the girl did nothing wrong, Madam Malikh wasn’t so muddled that she wasn’t aware what Blackwood Family and those corrupt elders conspiring against her husband and Malikh’s main family. Even Bhela herself couldn’t do anything to change her mother’s mind.</p>\n<p>However, Lyla Blackwood, an airhead as she always was, was oblivious of the hostility directed toward her.</p>\n<p>It was morning the second day Lyla in Badril Village. Following her friend Bhela, she carried a little box inside Patriarch Ghalim’s bedroom. This little box filled with custom-made medicines--most were amateurly mixed from two different trivial medicines, consisted of remedies for flu and headache. Nothing harmful but nothing useful at the same time. And just like yesterday, to pay for Bhela parents’ kindness for letting her staying in Malikh Family, Lyla Blackwood decided to play doctor a little bit.</p>\n<p>“Uncle, I’m coming again to help you feel better,” Lyla said as she dragged a chair and sat beside Patriarch Ghalim’s sick bed. Seeing the pale middle-aged man in bed, she blinked her googly eyes, then continued, “how’s yesterday medicine I gave you. Are you feeling a tiny minny bit better, perhaps?”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim certainly was feeling better these past few days, not because Lyla’s medicines, but Grandpa Piss’s diagnosis and remedies. Toward this girl, he weakly nodded. “Thank you for your help, little lady.”</p>\n<p>“Then I’m going to fed you my newest recipe, uncle. Here, here, open your mouth.”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghamil did what he was told. Because Lyla didn’t like bitter medicine, she added lots of brown sugar. Lots and lots of brown sugar.</p>\n<p>“It’s… sweet.”</p>\n<p>“Are you feeling better, now?” Lyla asked.</p>\n<p>“Yes, little lady, I’m feeling better.”</p>\n<p>As a matter of fact, he wasn’t. The medicine was more like a candy than remedy.</p>\n<p>“Good! If you eat this three times a day, maybe your illness would go away, uncle,” Lyla then sternly pointed out, “maybe!”</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh was nervous when her husband consumed the strange medicine Lyla gave him, but she didn’t open her mouth to protest. Bhela was changing the pillows’ sheet nearby, and doing some other chores that usually were done by the servants. In the meantime, Lyla was giving advice for Patriarch Ghalim liked how he should eat moderately three times a day, how he should brush his teeth after he ate sweets, and all the things Aunt Jiji told Lyla all the time.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to visit again, uncle, get well soon!” Lyla waved her hands. Carrying a broom in her hands, Lyla’s next schedule was following Bhela doing chores in the courtyard.</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim weakly waved his hand back. Of course, after the girls were already gone, he noticed his bitter wife biting her lips indignantly.</p>\n<p>“Don’t stare the girl so much. She’s not responsible for her family’s wrongdoings. It’s not like a girl her age knows what her parents do behind the scene.”</p>\n<p>“Why did you eat that? What if they used her to give you more poison?”</p>\n<p>“Bhela wouldn’t let me have the medicine if she didn’t what it was, no? Stop putting that kind of face, you only make our daughter feels awkward about all this.”</p>\n<p>The woman held her husband’s hand, kissing it with her forehead as she hid her face. She whispered, “Oh, don’t you know how hurt this heart holding back my grievance? Why did our daughter had to bring someone from that family inside our roof?” she sniffed, “how long this farce gonna last? What should I do in the mean time? Oh! I don’t know! I don’t know!”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim sighed as he witnessed his wife cried helplessly.</p>\n<p>In the courtyard, near the coops where Malikh Family raised chickens and ducks, Lyla was squatting in front of the new bunny she and Bhela bought just yesterday. She was waiting the whole morning just to feed this bunny. The bunny hopped around, itching to play in spite it couldn’t resist the temptation of delicious green leaves, again and again. Wathing how glutton the bunny was, Lyla found herself immerse in immense joy. She very much envying the life of a bunny. Perhaps that because she could relate to how it spent its day without worry; eating, playing, sleeping, then playing again--a life that she longed to have. If only she was born a rabbit instead of a young lady of noble family….</p>\n<p>The sound of the broom swept the ground took away her attention. Lyla couldn’t understand how a daughter of a patriarch like Bhela had to work so much.</p>\n<p>“Why do you work so much, Sistah?” Lyla asked when she found out there still much dry leaves Bhela had to sweep. “Won’t you get bored soon? Just let the servants clean this place.”</p>\n<p>Bhela, sweeping as if Lyla’s idleness didn’t bother her the slightest, replied, “Here in Badril Village, everyone who hasn’t done their coming of age ceremony has to do chores for their parents. It doesn’t matter if it’s the farmer’s daughter or the biggest family’s young lady, helping the matter of the household is one of the seven virtues we Mossack people get to do for our parents.”</p>\n<p>Originally, Lyla wanted her friend also playing with the bunny. But hearing Bhela just said something serious, there was no way she’d reveal her intention now. “My mom always nagging me to go to dance lesson or whatever. It’s very very boring,” she murmured, a bit dejected.</p>\n<p>“The west and the south have different values,” Bhela said. “Complete your virtue for your parents then you’ll grow to be a fine lady, Lyla.”</p>\n<p>“Uggghhh…” Lyla grunted as she didn’t want to continue the topic any further. She long developed a sense for her own survival to detect whether or not the conversation ended up she being forced to do some boring stuff. Knowing Bhela’s personality, Lyla knew soon Sis Bhela’d make her doing chores too. Grabbing the bunny, Lyla quickly escaped somewhere else so that she could spend her time playing. Bhela shook her head seeing the girl’s behavior.</p>\n<p>Bhela then noticed some servants whispering while they looking at Lyla from the distance. Many people were curious what a noble young lady like her would do in a rural place like this, and Bhela wasn’t that oblivious not to notice the eyes planted by the elders of Malikh Family.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, she then saw four girls dressed in expensive garments approaching Lyla with their mouth covered with feathered fans in their hands. Their clothing looked as if they attending some sort of ceremony, while in fact, they calculated that this kind of appearance was the most suitable for them to socialize with a girl of blue-blooded origin. Bhela recognized the leader of those girls was actually Elder Jhamil’s niece.</p>\n<p>“Have you read Le Armour dan Varoza written by Leornador De Gonzalez, Young Lady Blackwood?”</p>\n<p>“Ah, yes, that piece was adequately sophisticated but I think Vista van Gracious’s omnibus more than adequate, le banjour?”</p>\n<p>“I see, I see, their pieces adequately well-written as those senor themselves adequattely live as maestro. But perhaps equoliette more than fit the diagram as paradigm sensorita abligioate senor des adequately le banjour.”</p>\n<p>“But of course, Young Lady Blackwood is more addequately sophisitacted as it’s a noblesse obligiote to be more sohpisitacated than us village senioritas. Perhaps le banjour is fortuna with de gracious by Young Lady’s great wisdom?”</p>\n<p>Lyla blinked her eyes trying to decipher whatever these girls mean. The bunny in her arms even escaped amidst her confusion.</p>\n<p>“Uhh… uhhh…” Lyla timidly stepped back from the feathered fan girls. “I think Sis Bhela is calling me…”</p>\n<p>She swiftly ran away back to her friend Bhela.</p>\n<p>“Sistah, Sistah Bhela!” Lyla cried and grabbing Bhela’s sloven sleeve tightly, demanding for justice, “they came to bully me!”</p>\n<p>“What did they do?” Bhela asked.</p>\n<p>“They know I can’t speak western language! They came to test me! They’re even worse than those rich girls in seminar--they jumble some western mumbo jumbo into plain language in order to confuse me! They must be laughing and call me stupid by now!”</p>\n<p>Hearing Lyla’s grievance, Bhela patted her head in order to let the girl calmed down.</p>\n<p>“Lyla, those girls are different than the noble girls that always making fun of you.”</p>\n<p>“Different? How so?”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at the girls who also was watching them back while fanning themselves with their fabulous feathered fans.</p>\n<p>“They looked like noble descendants, but actually were not.”</p>\n<p>“I still don’t like them nonetheless!”</p>\n<p>“You don’t have to talk to them if you don’t want to,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>Yet Lyla still restlessly tugging Bhela’s sleeves, making it harder for her to do her chores. Before the peers that always making fun of her, Lyla was always helpless and had been depending on Bhela’s figure as a shield. What it looked like from the point of view of an outsider was a scene where a young mother being tested of her patience dealing with a girl who was throwing a tantrum.</p>\n<p>Seeing that the young noble miss wouldn’t come back soon, the feathered fan girls approaching Bhela and Lyla instead.</p>\n<p>“Oh, fancy to meet Young Lady Bhela here, le banjour!”</p>\n<p>“Le bonjour…” Bhela hesitated to reply back. Tilting her head slightly, she studied the pompously dressed girls before her. These girls were relatives of Malikh Family’s elders. None of them could match with Bhela if talking strictly about social status wise, not to mention talents. However, while she was holding her broom, it looked like Bhela was the one with common origin, while these girls were floating swans who happened to be generous enough to greet plebeians with their <em>unique</em> vocabulary.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Lyla Blackwood hid behind Lyla’s back. Despite a noble origin herself, meeting more cocky and fake young ladies than the girls before her were rare experience for Lyla.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela, fancy to meet you. Good morning. The weather is nice. I eat snails everyday,” Elder Jhamil’s niece took the lead and said that with a hint of inflated pride.</p>\n<p>Bhela narrowed her eyes. She could see why Lyla instantly hated these girls. She then said in a sleek foreign language, “Je ne sais pas de quoi tu parles. Si vous ne parlez pas une langue étrangère, fermez simplement la bouche, sinon vous faites peur aux enfants avec votre non-sens.”</p>\n<p>The feathered fan girls blinked their eyes trying to decipher whatever Bhela had said.</p>\n<p>“Oh, it turns out Young Lady Bhela is aquadettely know some le banjour!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, Young Lady Bhela is adequately sophisticated after all. Me gusta!”</p>\n<p>“I see, I see, le pasta fortuna is delicosaza.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s niece didn’t say anything as she only maintained a sweet smile while being nervous herself. Racking her brains over remembering the contents of thick dictionary, she tried to form a decent sentences in foreign language. But Bhela then cut off her train of thought before she could say a word.</p>\n<p>“Blackwood Family is migrating noble that has long been making their roots here in southern land. Hundred of years living far away from their western peers, noble families like this would naturally become more lax. It’s natural for Lyla to not mastering her homeland’s native tongue.”</p>\n<p>Bhela said that in a straight manner. That was a white lie, however. It was true that many noble families coming from the western side of Tiramikal Continent to forgot their western root and began to see themselves as southerners. But those were usually the case depending right circumstances, like exiled nobles, or some young masters who had lost in political battle branched out and fancied themselves a legit noble family with themselves at the helm. Blackwood Family weren’t exiled nobles, and though Lyla’s ancestors branching out some hundreds of years ago, that didn’t automatically made them cutting off ties with the original family. The main family of Blackwood was back in a western country called Tatalghia Kingdom, still sending letters and envoys from time to time to the branch Lyla was living in--although, undeniably, the southern branch of Blackwood Family had long developed and surpassed the main one.</p>\n<p>It seemed like Bhela already used to tell this lie. Anyone who heard this would be forced to accept it, unless they wanted to spend time and resources digging through the details--which to be honest, none of these pompous young girls were willing or simply unable to go through.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Elder Jhamil’s niece believed Lyla’s family exempt her to excel in foreign language. Yet she was still displeased inside. Her uncle told her that Bhela had been hogging the young noble’s influence for herself, everyone in Malikh Family already knew how Bhela Malikh carrying around the noble young lady yesterday. So what if she had some more bit of talent and had been running around overseas in that whatever seminars she was attending? A bumpkin origin wouldn’t be able to change their bumpkin bloodline. So if Bhela had the right to get close with the Young Lady of Blackwood Family, that meant someone coming from the same family should have the same change as her!</p>\n<p>The elder’s niece said, “Young Lady Bhela, I know the main family is prideful. But Young Lady Blackwood is here to experience the village slow life. Don’t you think she also needs to mingle with us commoners?”</p>\n<p>“Lyla will befriend any person she fancies herself, I don’t control with whom she wants to socialize with,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“If that’s the case, then why she still has no friends other than you?”</p>\n<p>“That’s not true!” Lyla cried indignantly, “I’ve made friends! With aunties! Aunties in the kitchen!”</p>\n<p>It was easy to be friendly with Lyla. She was always unconventional and never saw people by the social system. To her, people only divided by two types, those who gave her food and those who didn’t. She was like a cat. Just bring a good food and she’d be very friendly the next moment.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Lyla’s frank open-mindedness wasn’t easily accepted by some people. Elder Jhamil’s niece gasped as she looked at Lyla and Bhela, back and forth. “My goodness! Young Lady Bhela, were you letting a noble young lady such as Young Lady Blackwood mingle with dirty servants?!”</p>\n<p>“Why wouldn’t I?” Bhela asked back.</p>\n<p>“You--don’t young lady care about our family’s reputation? What if people said we’ve mistreated a noble young lady?”</p>\n<p>“Lyla is here to experience village slow life,” Bhela said slowly, “don’t you think she also needs to mingle with commoners?”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s niece was speechless as Bhela used her own words. The contorted expression on her chaky make-up face brought satisfaction for Lyla, who then snorted.</p>\n<p>“What now? Kitty got your tongue?” Lyla said with her mouth pouted. “So that you know, Sis Bhela already made speechless many many bullies like you! Who were many many many times smarter than you! This is what you get by making fun of me--shame on you, hmph! Who’s the stupid one, now?”</p>\n<p>Even after losing a round of squabble against Young Lady Bhela, unexpectedly the nobly young lady herself became hostile against her. All was so sudden that it made blood drained from her face.</p>\n<p>Bhela ruffled Lyla’s hair. Apparently Lyla still believed these girls came to bully her. When Lyla already made up her mind to not liking someone, it was hard to bend on her opinion.</p>\n<p>“Let’s go, Lyla. We’ll help aunties make sweets for afternoon lunch,” Bhela said. Back in the seminars, when Bhela asked Lyla to do some chores, the supposed noble young lady of Blackwood Family would move slowly, occasionally pouting and murmuring some complaints, unwilling to exert her calories on some boring stuff. However, it was different if the destination was kitchen. The spirit of lively bunny would come to possess her--she’d jolt, sprinting, unwilling to waste time as the promise of free sweets and delicious salty snacks was revealed before her.</p>\n<p>“What was that about?!” one of the le bonjour girls scowled after Bhela and Lyla was gone. “How could a young lady speaks like that?”</p>\n<p>“Bhela must lead her around to act like that! Did you hear what she said? The noble young lady thinks we bully her or something.”</p>\n<p>“Aahhh! What a manipulative bitch! I really want to know what that little cunt said to make Young Lady Blackwood think we had made fun of her. No way in hell someone would dare making fun of a noble like her!”</p>\n<p>Actually, Lyla was made fun of so many times. Especially during her study in the seminars abroad. She made fun of so much that she formed a survival instinct to hide behind Bhela’s back. But they didn’t know that. They just assumed as a young lady coming from a noble family, Lyla Blackwood would be adequately pure noble in stories and gossip. The main reason Bhela brought Lyla away was so that Lyla didn’t have to mingle with these delusional le bonjour girls.</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-2/chapter-62":"<p>When the news about what happened in Malikh Family’s ngajen ceremony arrived at Blackwood Family, Madam Blackwood was so enraged she broke the tea cup she held onto the floor. Establishing the family’s foot in Badril Village was supposed to be easy, but not only he failed to gain the support of Malikh Family and the villagers, the Young Master of Blackwood Family somehow managed to incite the bedridden patriarch’s supporters to regain their lost foothold against the corrupt Malikh Family’s elders.</p>\n<p>“There’s no point keeping him in that rural village,” Madam Blackwood said. She was a flamboyant, late thirty years old woman whose beauty was so superior that the previous viscount adopt her as a daughter. “Call Frane back to the city, he’s going to spend two months training in capital!”</p>\n<p>The butler who was waiting for her bowed and went away to carry out the task.</p>\n<p>“How’s Lyla’s birthday party going?”</p>\n<p>“Reply to madam, the party has started, the guests who came only from baron nobilities and mid-rank merchants,” a maid replied.</p>\n<p>The madam glanced the timid middle-aged man who sat on the same table as her. She scoffed, saying, “Look how your daughter made a name for herself. Not only the bribe money was wasted away, she coming on trips in the seminars only resulting her made a fool out of herself! Hah, like father, like daughter! Imbecile!”</p>\n<p>Madam Blackwood hurled the new cup that recently poured with hot, scalding tea. She purposely aimed at the table so the hot water splashed on the viscount’s hands. The timid viscount didn’t make a sound when his hands getting burnt, he didn’t dare to fight against his wife. It was already ten years too late for him to retaliate in any way. From the way he dragged his limping leg to fetch damp towel for his scaling skin, it was clear the waiting servants already used to ignore him.</p>\n<p>Recently, his wife’s mood had became the worst ever since their youngest daughter came back from the two years seminars. Unlike Frane--who only registered as his son by blood in papers, Lyla hadn’t show any particular talents in becoming a Class worthy of a noble family. She had a decent progress speed, a Level 7 Novice after seminars, but that progress mainly because she never had the interest to train herself. Madam Blackwood had bribed the officials so Lyla could enter the seminars supposed to boost her standing in high society, so she could catch higher ranking nobles eyes somehow. However, that plan failed in the worst way that could happen to a noble family like the Blackwood. She made blunders and broke rules so many times that she became a laughing stock. The only families that interested in her only lower rank nobles and not-so well off merchant families.</p>\n<p>“There also no point keeping that useless girl forever in the mansion,” Madam Blackwood said. “Send her to Badril Village by tomorrow. Make some smart men tending to her needs--they have to smart enough to know how to reel those Malikh villagers to say yes when I send my words in the future!”</p>\n<p>After the son’s failure, the madam would send her daughter, to do nothing but play around in Malikh Family. Even if there was something the girl could do, the madam surely wouldn’t choose this daughter of hers who she deemed too brainless to do even the simplest tasks. Her daughter was just that useless to her. The one with received the orders were people who accompanied her, who had experience in bribing and coercing. They were tasked to devour Malikh Family from the inside. The Blackwood would surely corner Bhela Malikh this time.</p>\n<p>Somewhere else, in a colorless courtyard, a birthday party already went on for about two hours. Most guests already leaving, not unlike the year before the two-years seminars happened when the sons of noble families dallying around waiting for a chance to talk with the young lady. Today, the Young Lady of Blackwood Family turned fourteen, two years before she would considered mature, but this young miss still pouting her mouth like a little girl.</p>\n<p>The old handmaid saw her young lady was bored and offered a treat.</p>\n<p>“Young lady, try this cake. A certain famous bakery made this just for your birthday.”</p>\n<p>The cake served on a small plate along with a silver fork. The girl took only mere seconds to finish it.</p>\n<p>“Is it good?” the handmaid asked.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t matter if it’s good or not, Aunt Jiji, I still hungry with this tiny minny bit of cake! Let me eat that one!” the girl pointed at the layered cake served on the center of the party.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Lyla, you can’t!”</p>\n<p>“Why can’t I?!”</p>\n<p>“You must present yourself as a proper young lady, so you can’t!”</p>\n<p>The cake was to be portioned to serve for the same amount of guests since the last party, but because the Blackwood Family’s young lady had a bad reputation in the seminars, most invited families didn’t actually come.</p>\n<p>“But I can’t be a lady if I’m hungry, am I?”</p>\n<p>“You must learn the way. Be patient, Young Lady Lyla!”</p>\n<p>“But I am huuungriiiiieeeehhh!!!”</p>\n<p>Aunt Jiji was terrified when she realized the young lady wasn’t referred only to portion of the cake, but she wanted to eat the whole cake. This shorty girl, although her feature was thin with only her cheeks got plump, actually had a talent to be a terrifying glutton that would be seen in Tiramikal Continent every one hundred years. It was a useless talent that brought only shame to Blackwood Family.</p>\n<p>It was fortunate that before the young lady could make a big ruckus, a maidservant came to bring the news about the madam’s decision. Aunt Jiji passed it to the young lady immediately.</p>\n<p>“You heard that, young lady! Madam is going to send you for a vacation!”</p>\n<p>Lyla’s head straightened, she forgot to pout. “Vacation? Where? Where where?”</p>\n<p>“To Badril Village!”</p>\n<p>“Badril Village?” the girl tilted her head. “Where’s that?”</p>\n<p>“If you promise Aunt Jiji not to eat too much cake today, Aunt Jiji will tell you where it is…”</p>\n<p>“I will if it turned out somewhere fun!”</p>\n<p>“Badril Village is where Young Lady Bhela’s home place!”</p>\n<p>“Sis Bhela’s home?!” Lyla gasped, “yahoooo!!!”</p>\n<p>Ignoring that she was the center of attention, Lyla suddenly jumped and danced like no tomorrow. Aunt Jiji tried to stop her, but it was futile since Lyla only promised not to be glutton. The remaining guests began whispering with each other. They were people who doubted the rumors about this Young Lady Blackwood, but after seeing how childish and ridiculous the girl danced, people were finally convinced. How was this a viscount’s daughter supposed to act? The girl danced her hips and hopped around like a bunny that had an itchy bum. Soon, the Young Lady Lyla Blackwood fell to the bottom list of desired young ladies to marry. Her reputation fell from not-so-smart, to stupid, and then fell again to brainless and imbecile. People didn’t see her in a good light. But that just how a girl named Lyla Blackwood really was.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Yashura Family got a peculiar visitor these past two days. He introduced himself as an expert from overseas, and somehow this foreign expert became interested in Shira Yashura. When the story leaked by insiders from Yashura Family, people were scratching their heads, wondering what could an educated man saw from this trash who could only get himself to level 3 Novice. Some people even sneered, saying that whole news was just Yashura Family’s little trick to clear up rumors from their heir’s name.</p>\n<p>“You understand, kiddo? There are three mandatory rules if someone wants to meet privately with me. First rule, it’s a <em>she</em>, not <em>he</em>. Second rule, big boobs. Third rule, in her lower part, there must be big bubbly butts, as big as her boobs. <em>Anything</em> lesser than that you can just send them back to wherever they came from.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit said that as he moved his chess piece, eating one of Shira’s pawns.</p>\n<p>“And remember, my standard is pretty high. Consult with how loadful those girls from Big-Boobed Sect are for more information,” the Nalaq continued.</p>\n<p>“Please don’t talk nonsense. I’m being serious here,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“Ey, I’m not talking nonsense. The girls from Big-Boobed Sect are real deal, okay? They’re huge! If you don’t believe me then you should go to Elzhier Family one of these days, go check out how glorious their boobs are. They always dance or become the maidservants when they’re not on duties.”</p>\n<p>“Ol’ Good-Natured Spirit… I don’t want to hear this imaginary all-woman sect of yours. Elzhier Family is only a normal rural family, they don’t host any sect members within their walls. If they did, the Village Head would boast about it at my uncle’s face every single day.”</p>\n<p>“You just don’t believe it because you never see how great they are--their boobs, I mean. How great those melons inside tight suits are! Just think about it; leather suits and melons--two entirely different things but if they come together they’d jiggling in harmony. This Good-Natured Spirit approved their sense of style.”</p>\n<p>“Forget about it, it’s not important--”</p>\n<p>“Boobs are important, ey!”</p>\n<p>Shira waved his hand as he didn’t want to continue this nonsense. He then moved a piece and finished his turn. He returned the topic back again, “The expert said he came from a first-tier faction called Blue Robe Society. If we can get his faction’s recognition then at least my family can silence all those rumors about me--especially the recent ones, they really are becoming a pain in the ass.”</p>\n<p>“I told you. I don’t talk with guys. No boobs, no good. Period.”</p>\n<p>“You are really becoming a pain in the ass,” Shira complained.</p>\n<p>After Shira said that, Good-Natured Spirit’s knight jumped over a wall of pawns to get on his bishop. Within a single breath Shira immediately moved his rook, creating a chain reaction that exposes the Nalaq’s defence, resulting his king trapped in three different direction.</p>\n<p>“Check mate.”</p>\n<p>“Ey, what the fu--” Good-Natured Spirit rage quit, flipping the chess board. “Hah! I knew it! You brat, you intentionally make me talk about boobs in order to lower my guard, right?! Fuck! That is how it is, isn’t it?!”</p>\n<p>“No, it is not.”</p>\n<p>“You sneaky bastard. You really got me,” Good-Natured Spirit threw his hands up in the air. <br>\n“Man, I surrender, that is some sick psychological tactic you got there.”</p>\n<p>“Now I don’t really know what you’re talking about.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit waved his hands in surrender, then he lit a cigarette. “Anyway, what do you want from me this time? Money again? I prepared some kobe coins enough for you to buy some candy, here, take this.”</p>\n<p>Shira shoved back the coin bag. “Not today. I just want you to meet Sir Baront Staterwind.”</p>\n<p>“No boobs, no good. Ask something else. How about I tell you the secret place where are those Big-Boobed Sect girls take their bath, ‘ey? Seems fair deal to me.”</p>\n<p>“How many times do I have to tell you--”</p>\n<p>“Sssshhh!!” Good-Natured Spirit hushed the boy. He then whispered, “you hear that?”</p>\n<p>Because the Nalaq suddenly became vigilant, Shira instinctively lowered his voice too. “Hear what?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“I heard some rats watching us…” the Nalaq covered his mouth, as if he didn’t want people to read lips what he said next, “some big-boobed rats…”</p>\n<p>“Huh… what?”</p>\n<p>“The girls from Big-Boobed Sect… they’re here…”</p>\n<p>“The heck are you talking about? This hill is Yashura Family’s property--”</p>\n<p>“Sssshhhh! They’ve noticed me noticing them. Wait here, I’mma get you some melons for your reward!”</p>\n<p>After he saying that, Good-Natured Spirit’s figure melting into the thin air.</p>\n<p>Shira Yashura sighed. At times, asking favor to this vulgar Nalaq not only difficult, it also unpredictable he’d only incite troubles if he not careful.</p>\n<p>After his winning streak for more than half a year maybe he became cocky. He forgot the Nalaq wasn’t there to solve his problem whenever he wanted, although the Nalaq sort of ended up like that after a few months he came here. Shira got some thinking, maybe he should stop seeing this Nalaq as his convenient piggy bank for his own good.</p>\n<p>“Really, he always making a mess for me to clean. I wonder if such thoughtless Nalaqs like him are common around here… now, where’s the last piece again?” he sighed for the second time.</p>\n<p>When he was picking up chess pieces that board Good-Natured Spirit flipped earlier, Shira realized there was a missing piece. Turned out it was stuck in the hole between tree roots.</p>\n<p>He plunged his hand to look for the missing chess piece.</p>\n<p>“Ugh… my fingers can’t reach.”</p>\n<p>He tried to squirm his body to fit his hand in.</p>\n<p>“Where is it again?”</p>\n<p>He frowned. He squirmed his body again really hard.</p>\n<p>“Oh, there it--”</p>\n<p><em>BOOOOOMMMMM!!!!</em></p>\n<p>An explosion happened not far away from the place he used to hang out, creating a wave of rolling dust that swept over the hill. Shira got his hand stuck between the tree rots, he could only hugged his head with his free hand and waited for the shockwave to finish. The chess pieces he gathered already nowhere to be found. He cooked up his head, looking left and right, and saw the greeny grasses were covered with dirts and trees were uprooted. The whole hill became a shithole kind of mess.</p>\n<p>Before the boy could swallow what was going on, a chuckle could be heard near him. Before him, Good-Natured Spirit emerged, coiling around the Nalaq’s body were purple-colored living flames that hungrily tried to eat him whole.</p>\n<p>As carefree as he usually was, Good-Natured Spirit said with a grin, “Those Big-Boobed Sect girls sure are feisty. They’re escaping too fast, I can’t get you melons. I managed to get a feeling of their butts, though. Here, there’s some fragrant left behind.”</p>\n<p>Shira stepped back when the Nalaq offered his palm. It was still on fire, the boy didn’t want to get burn along with him. Besides, he didn’t want to get involved with the Nalaq’s deprived hobby.</p>\n<p>“Sure you don’t want it?” Good-Natured Spirit took a last sniff from his palm, followed by a low chuckle of his.</p>\n<p>“Good-Natured Spirit… what’s that fire?”</p>\n<p>“Yeah? Dunno, man. Exorcism flame or something.”</p>\n<p>“Ohh… oh, it’s very nice to know you up until know. Good bye.”</p>\n<p>“Hmm? You want to go somewhere?” Realizing the purple flame was getting annoying, Good-Natured Spirit then patted away the coiling flame from his shoulders like it was nothing.</p>\n<p>Shira shrugged his shoulders. It seemed this bastard Nalaq was too tough for that exorcism flame. Maybe the flame was too ordinary? Whatever, he didn’t care about that anymore. His eyes then swept the ruin around him. He said, “You can’t forget about the meeting for today. But please clean the mess you made yourself.”</p>\n<p>“That’s what you want for the chess reward?”</p>\n<p>Shira nodded.</p>\n<p>“Aye, aye, will do.” Good-Natured Spirit flicked his fingers, and human-sized paper cranes came out of thin air. They were obedient, not clear whether were monsters or just magical devices. The paper cranes used magnet-like magic to carry the messy uprooted trees and boulders, along with sweeping the dirt from the grass. The cleaning up might take a while, since the hill really was a mess. Shira, feeling a little light on the head, facepalming as he returned back to Yashura Family.</p>\n<p>The whole explosion could be heard from all over Badril Village. It wasn’t clear what its cause, but Yashura Family sent guards to prevent people from knowing what really happened. In Yashura Family’s guest hall, Patriarch Shuro Yashura, a few good Yashura Family elders, and the respected visitor, Sir Baront Staterwind, forming a circle as they sat cross-legged, discussing the explosion that had just occurred.</p>\n<p>“Good elders, Sir Patriarch Yashura, I know you must get excited when I said Young Master Shira has some talent in communicating with Nalaqs. However, a Nalaq still a Nalaq. You must not offend a Nalaq whatsoever, or the consequence is dire! Young Master Shira’s life is way more important than getting a qualification to enter my school!” Sir Baront Staterwind warned. His forehead was still wet with sweat, since he hurriedly ran to Yashura Family when he realized the direction of recent explosion.</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, you’re right, Sir Staterwind. Absolutely right! I already sent someone to check on my nephew’s condition, please calm down,” Patriarch Shuro said.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront shook his head. “You don’t really know what I’m trying to say, do you? You should prepare a very good healer or a doctor, Patriarch Shuro, because if it isn’t death, one can easily lose a limb over angering a Nalaq! That happens more often than you think!”</p>\n<p>The elders drew cold breaths in unison when they heard that. Patriarch Shuro, whose face already pale, becoming even whiter than a sheet of paper. If they boy lost a limb, Shira’s chance to succeed him as the next patriarch could be swept away like specks of dust.</p>\n<p>Yulong the Butler arrived. Everyone in the room had been anxiously waiting for him they instinctively stood up when Yulong approached.</p>\n<p>“Yulong, how’s Shira doing?” Patriarch Shuro asked.</p>\n<p>Yulong replied, “Young Master Shira is back, patriarch. But Madam Yashura sent him to the kitchen for a second breakfast.”</p>\n<p>“Breakfast? What’s a breakfast has something to do with that explosion? Can he still walk?”</p>\n<p>“He’s walking fine, Patriarch Yashura.”</p>\n<p>“Then, Yulong, please go fetch my nephew for me, we have something urgent to tell him!”</p>\n<p>After his trained elegant bow, Yulong stepped back and proceeded to do the task given to him.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront Staterwind peered at the butler’s back. He traveled southern lands many times, visiting many villages, yet, he seldom heard a Mossack descent major family employed western-style butler. What made him confused even more that Sir Kurusiya apparently knew the butler and gave his respect to him, which Sir Baront Staterwind didn’t expect that coming from the cold eastern Kaya swordsman.</p>\n<p>“Dear good elder,” Sir Baront Staterwind asked a random elder who sat beside him, “may I know why there’s a butler working here?”</p>\n<p>“Is Sir referring to Yulong? Yulong isn’t actually working for Yashura Family, but Young Master Shira’s mother’s attendant. I can’t tell you the details, so forgive me sir, all I can say is Young Master Shira’s father is exceedingly brave and awesome he managed to woo a respectable lady many years ago.”</p>\n<p>“Ahhh…” Sir Baront nodded. The boy apparently a result of his parent eloping. The Blue Robe Society expert of course knew etiquette to hold himself from digging the story further.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, Yulong came back with Shira followed behind. The boy wore new clothes since his previous one was dirty. When he saw the group of elders and the expert guest looking at him, Shira sighed inside his heart. He knew he had to clean Good-Natured Spirit’s mess once again.</p>\n<p>“Greetings, elders… greetings, uncle patriarch… greetings, Sir Staterwind…”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro impatiently treading forward. “Shira my boy, is it true that you lost your limbs?”</p>\n<p>“I’m unhurt, uncle, see?” Shira waved both of his hands to prove that his limbs still functioned as they should be.</p>\n<p>“Oh! God, thank God! Really! These are really your hands, aren’t they? Not a fake one made with wood?” Patriarch Shuro Yashura grabbed his nephew hands and waved it around like a child playing with flags.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira,” Sir Baront opened his mouth, “I reckon you failed to ask the Nalaq to meet me? If you can’t do it, young master, it best for you not to push him any further. Today, you offend him and he blast the hill behind your Yashura Family as a warning, but what happens if you make the same mistake tomorrow?”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro nodded at his words vigorously. “Sir Baront is right, Shira my boy. A Nalaq is a revered being ancient Mossacks worshiped as their guardian angel. The consequence of making them mad is very dire! You should know better, my boy, you should’ve told your uncle if a Nalaq came to you the first time!”</p>\n<p>Sir Baront and his uncle Patriarch Shuro had good intentions in telling him about how to be respectful to a Nalaq. But the more Shira heard their warning, the more he doubted about Good-Natured Spirit being a “revered” Nalaq like they said. Of course, saying the truth about the explosion’s true cause resulting only Yashura Family losing face in front of Sir Baront Staterwind. Shira had no choice, he had to tread the matter very carefully.</p>\n<p>“<em>Cough, cough</em>… Uncle, Sir Baront, thank you for your concern. Truth is, it wasn’t that the Nalaq being mad that causes the explosion, but there was some… accident… that happened right before.”</p>\n<p>“With what title do you usually call him, Young Master Shira?” Sir Baront asked.</p>\n<p>“As far as I know, he doesn’t have a title. At least he didn’t tell me if he ever had one. He told me to call him ‘Good-Natured Spirit’.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, with that kind of nickname, he must be a very benevolent person when he was alive,” Sir Baront concluded as he rubbed his beard. “So, Young Master Shira, it seems he didn’t really intent to blast into smithereens.”</p>\n<p>Shira nodded. That part was true. Instead, someone else happened to be intending to blast this Nalaq into smithereens.</p>\n<p>“Thank God! Thank God! If he is a good Nalaq, maybe we don’t need to throw the second ngajen ceremony for this month, after all!” Patriarch Shuro Yashura exclaimed. The elders in the guest hall followed his exclaiming by handclapping and joyful cries. Ngajen ceremony only held once a month so the village safe from angry Selaqs, no one ever tried it to protect themselves from intelligent Nalaqs. Since the village was founded, the locals never had a Nalaq dwelling there. So it was natural for the elders to worry about throwing a ceremony they didn’t know working or not. Ngajen ceremony was expensive, after all.</p>\n<p>The more Shira saw how the previous tense hall turned jubilant and full of relieved faces, the more awkward he became. That Nalaq might call himself ‘Good-Natured Spirit’, yet he was anything but good. A low-life spirit who no doubt had been using the invisibility traits of spirits to commit many deprived crimes. He was closer to evil spirit incarnation than a good-natured one. The misunderstanding was too great his face twisted as if he’d just taste a sour lemon.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront Staterwind said, “Still, since he seems reluctant to use his old name, I reckon the Nalaq that approaching you is a low-tier one, Young Master Shira. Low-tier Nalaqs usually spirits that gain consciousness merely by luck. They don’t have factions backing them, and fortunately--in my experience--it easier to initiate negotiation with unaffiliated Nalaqs.” A hint of pride then flashed through his eyes, he continued, “my disciples will arrive tomorrow morning. One of them contracted with a high-tier Nalaq. Since the Nalaq’s mood turned sour is partly my fault, with help from the Nalaq contracted with one of my disciples, I will ask him to leave Yashura Family peacefully!”</p>\n<p>“Sir Staterwind is wise! Thank you for your concern, Sir!” Patriarch Shuro sang praises toward this expert. The elders of Yashura Family followed suit.</p>\n<p>“As expected of such expert!”</p>\n<p>“Sir Staterwind is the best of bunch of all experts that I know all my life!”</p>\n<p>“Hurray for Sir Staterwind!”</p>\n<p>They circling Sir Baront Staterwind and, not long after that, someone started to prostate. They behaved as if the guest was their one and only savior. Even Shira was getting embarrassed from seeing the scene, not to mention the already flushing Baront Staterwind.</p>\n<p>When everyone getting carried away, Shira slipped out after excusing himself. He knew he was no match for the Yashura Family’s older generations’ shamelessness. Upon walking outside, he saw Yulong was standing by the hall’s door looking galant as usual with his butler professionalism.</p>\n<p>“Can you please try to stop my uncle, Yulong? Sir Staterwind is started to get uncomfortable there.”</p>\n<p>Yulong glanced at the whole mess inside, and then he said to his young master, “I think it’s not everyday an expert coming to Yashura Family, young master, so let’s count this as Patriarch Yashura to gaining favors from a foreign expert.”</p>\n<p>“Are they really okay, though?”</p>\n<p>Yulong smiled.</p>\n<p>“Of course they aren’t, young master. But Patriarch Shuro and the family elders are honest people. Although sometimes they can be overwhelming, I’m sure Sir Staterwind can see no falsehood in their words.”</p>\n<p>Shira looked at those elders inside once again. The more he saw, the more he realized that those hysterical village men calling a man they barely knew these past two days a savior by no means a lie from their part. The elders really were freaking out when they heard the explosion. And Patriarch Shuro Yashura was the most worried of the bunch, considering him a patriarch and an uncle. Thinking about it all again, Shira couldn’t really say he still embarrassed seeing the elders spewing exaggerated flattering with straight faces.</p>\n<p>“Sir Staterwind comes from a respectable sect. Someone like that won’t get to travel the southern lands if he didn’t know the nature of the local people. So it best not to worry about it too much, young master,” Yulong said.</p>\n<p>“Really… ah, speaking of sects,” Shira deliberately changed the topic, “I heard from someone that one of the major families in Badril Village hosts members of a certain sect in secret. You’re from outside, Yulong--do you think something so outrageous like that could happen?”</p>\n<p>“Some older sects have long reaching influence, but I don’t think anyone would be interested to plant their own in Badril Village. There’s nothing valuable here for them to take notice.”</p>\n<p>“As I thought. It’s just unthinkable to think some secret powers lurking beneath our everyday lives. What if some experts actually pretending to be servants here in Yashura Family?”</p>\n<p>Although it wasn’t noticeable, Yulong’s smile became stiff.</p>\n<p>“You jest, young master. If that was true, do you think your uncle and the elders can take that kind of truth?”</p>\n<p>Following Yulong’s gaze, Shira peeped the hall and saw Sir Baront’s awkward figure, where he was in the center of Yashura Family elites--all of them-- who passionately prostrating in the floor. They practically worshipping him now.</p>\n<p>“You’re right…” Shira could only hide his face with his palm. Just when he thought he could understand them, the boy then wished he didn’t know these shameless men.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>As far as the current generation of Badril Village locals knew, they never got visited by nobles until this month Malikh Family’s ngajen ceremony happened. Everyone still talking about it.</p>\n<p>Young Master of Blackwood Family only stayed in Badril Village in one day. And the noble carriage of Blackwood Family set off out of Badril Village by noon. The next morning after the day he was gone, the two foreign guests who had been staying in Malikh Family, Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia, felt overstaying might be unnecessary, thus decided to leave too.</p>\n<p>Because the carriages going out from Badril Village mostly for public transports, Bhela personally asked an elder from his father’s faction who had a horse carriage to give her guests a ride to the nearest town, where they’d later book a private carriage for them to return home. Mister Harrington, as an unsocial bachelor as he always was, was waiting in the carriage for Madame Sylvia to say her parting words to Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>“You have a very bright future, Young Lady Bhela. A girl with limitless potential. So your favor will become very valuable as you mature,” Madame Sylvia said. “If you need something, you can always send letters to my sect. Don’t hold back. Just think about this of us making an investment.”</p>\n<p>Since Bhela a smart girl anyway, Madame Sylvia decided not to make her words fancy and told her in a straightforward manner. Bhela appreciated her honesty, and said her thanks.</p>\n<p>The carriage then set off. In the main gate of Badril Village, the guards on duty witnessed the recently blazing popular Young Lady Bhela Malikh bowing her body as she sent off two foreigners in traveling clothes made from expensive linen.</p>\n<p>“Look at how she is,” inside the carriage, Madame Sylvia said to Mister Harrington. “She’s a pretty sensible girl, don’t you think?”</p>\n<p>“She is,” Mister Harrington said softly, almost a murmur.</p>\n<p>It was hard to start a conversation whenever Mister Harrington sat with his arms crossed tightly. Madame Sylvia could see that he wasn’t exactly happy with the outcome regarding Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>There was no bandits lurking around, and no monsters occasionally came out, proved that the lands around Badril Village actually well-protected--too well, perhaps, for a rural village without a major power backing them. Their journey was smooth without disturbance. Thirty minutes after they left Badril Village, they encountered another carriage painted with black-jet color. The black carriage was well-decorated with golden-colored plates, obviously elites or nobles were traveling inside.</p>\n<p>However, unlike common nobles who liked to hide in the carriage to show-off their elegance and aloofness, this carriage simply out of commonsense. To talk about how weird this carriage was there was a need to point out the refreshing greenness of the view around. Despite there being a road far away from settlement, hint of liveliness from bird chirping--along with croaking frogs from nearby streams and singing insects--completed the idyllic road with a strange harmony that invited light-hearted person to sing along with lively nature. That was exactly what the noble in the black carriage doing. A young lady with a very girly and childish feature was carefreely sitting in the window in spite of pale servants begging her to sit still. She completely dumb about the servants’ pleas. And with her personality, nobody knew whether she was pretending or not. The only thing that the jubilant Lyla Blackwood cared about was singing an off-tune song about her befriending village frogs and bunnies.</p>\n<p>“Prepare your life you frogs and bunnies~</p>\n<p>Cause I’m not letting you go before we become the best of buddies~~</p>\n<p>Wait for me you birdies and kitties~~</p>\n<p>Cause we’re about to become the best of all buddies~~ yuhuu~ yuhuu~~</p>\n<p>The best buddies in this lifetime~~ yuhuuuu~~~”</p>\n<p>There was nothing the servants and the guards could do to stop their young lady from singing this amazingly ugly song about her future exploits in Badril Village. Seeing that another carriage approaching, the horse-riding guards did their best to block the view to the crest planted on the carriage’s compartment. Their effort to save faces from the young lady’s mishap was futile, however, since the other party happened to know Lyla.</p>\n<p>“How many times have I told you to stay away from windows, Lyla!”</p>\n<p>“Whu--what? Who?” Lyla was surprised. But then she was elated to see a familiar face. “Is that you, Instructor Sylvia? You here to train Sis Bhela’s archery again?”</p>\n<p>“Get down from the window!” Madame Sylvia raised her voice.</p>\n<p>“I’m also here to meet Sis Bhela!” Lyla also raised her voice cheerfully.</p>\n<p>“Lyla, you won’t be able to get married in the future if you’re always act like this!” Madame Sylvia warned her. She long dropped title of Young Lady Blackwood when talking to this naughty girl.</p>\n<p>“Um!” Lyla nodded. “But which one do you like more, Instructor Sylvia, bunnies or kitties?” It was no use trying to talk sense to Lyla. Any warning only come to her right ear and gone out straight from the left one.</p>\n<p>“Stay away from the windows!!!” Madame Sylvia screamed until her voice shrilled.</p>\n<p>Lyla also screamed, “Good morning to you too!!!”</p>\n<p>Both carriages drifted apart after the brief encounter. It ended with Lyla happily waved her hands happily. Madame Sylvia sighed and shook her head. That girl was so naughty that the troubles she created made the seminars’ managements even considered to drop her once during the seminars. Only after Bhela Malikh convinced them she’d take care of Lyla they finally did let go the matter.</p>\n<p>Before, the black carriage of Blackwood Family came to Badril Village in the shroud of night’s darkness, so nobody noticed their elegance and the aura of expensive carriage blazing through the village road--of which was surprisingly wide for a settlement road, unlike road of cities in the western kingdoms, because long ago Mossack people needed to endure monster stampedes passing through their villages once every few months.</p>\n<p>“Mom, look, is that a noble?” a snotty kid pointing out the carriage.</p>\n<p>The mother hurriedly pulled her child. “Ssuuussh! Keep your finger to yourself! Don’t you know what happened to peasants that make noble angry from the stories they always talking about?”</p>\n<p>The steel-armored guards who escort the carriage scoffed them in disdain. Contrast with the escorts’ attitudes, Lyla waved her hand at them, while shouting, “Hey boy, don’t you think bunnies are cute as the kitties? Or do you like cats more?”</p>\n<p>The kid didn’t answer. He instead forced to bow by her mother and let the carriage went through silently. The villagers didn’t have the experience in receiving nobles, most of them--except for those who attended the ngajen ceremony in Malikh Family--had never saw nobles in their lives. Because of that they were awkward and didn’t know what to do.</p>\n<p>Lyla didn’t seem to mind their stiffness. Instead, she vigorously greeted everyone she saw from the window she sat on.</p>\n<p>“Good day! Good morning! I’m here to sleepover at Sis Bhela’s place! Do you know where Sis Bhela lives?”</p>\n<p>Back in Elzhier Family, in the main family’s house, their patriarch, hurriedly changed his clothes to a formal one he always used every ngajen ceremony.</p>\n<p>“Hurry, hurry! As the head of this village, how can I let a noble arriving without me receiving them?!”</p>\n<p>Not even he yet buttoned his shirt properly, the Village Head sprinted toward the main street, only to see the crowd of onlookers already dispersed and still talking about the scary nobles they always heard in stories were actually <em>weirdly</em> friendly.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Bhela Malikh was already notified about Lyla Blackwood’s arrival. She waited on a chair at the Malikh Family’s gate, drinking a fresh young coconut water occasionally. The black carriage finally was in her view. And the young girl she was waiting for happily waved her hand at her. From the window.</p>\n<p>“Carefull, Lyla!” Bhela yelled as she sprang from her chair.</p>\n<p>“Huuupp!” Lyla Blackwood simply didn’t want to waste anytime leaving the carriage through the door. So she simply jumped from the window she sat upon, before the carriage even stopped. It was fortunate that amongst Bhela’s skill as a Unique Class, she had <b>Haste</b>, which boosted her speed in short duration. She used that to catch Lyla before she hurt herself. The young noble girl landed splendidly in Bhela’s arm.</p>\n<p>“What’s this, Sistah?” Lyla’s eyes sparkled when she saw Bhela get a young coconut in her other hand. She was completely oblivious she just did something dangerous.</p>\n<p>“Young coconut. There’s still some of its water left. Here, try this,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“For me? Really?”</p>\n<p>“Drink slowly…”</p>\n<p><em>Glug glug glug</em>. Lyla drank the coconut in anything but in slowly manner. She even burped shamelessly.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Lyla, ah!” the butler who coming with her was in horror seeing how Young Lady Lyla Blackwood made a horrible mess by spilling the coconut water on her expensive, silk woven black dress. Only an equally expensive silk handkerchief worthy enough to wipe his young lady’s noble dress!</p>\n<p>“I told you to drink slowly…” Bhela said. She used her sleeve to wipe Lyla’s wet face, and then proceeded to also wipe Lyla’s dress.</p>\n<p>“Y-young miss!” the butler shouted in panic. His body jolted as soon as he saw the outrageous act of spoiling the young noble’s dress by making it contacted with commoner clothes. That was heresy! He needed her to stop before she contained Blackwood’s expensive dress with her commoner’s bacteria!</p>\n<p>“You need something?” Bhela looked at this unfamiliar butler of Blackwood Family. Her expressionless face judged the butler coldly.</p>\n<p>“My name is Tim, young miss--please use this!” the butler offered a silky smooth handkerchief with Blackwood Family’s crest embroidered on the surface. The handkerchief was actually the butler’s, was awarded to his great-great-great grandfather by the then Baron Blackwood for some sort of achievement that practically nobody was still alive to remember. Everytime Butler Tim met a new person, he’d make an excuse to show off this particular handkerchief. Today was no exception. It was his most precious handkerchief. Just from the look of it one could tell how crazy expensive it was.</p>\n<p>“Ah, ah… my nose… aahhh--” Lyla felt her nose was wet and itchy, “--ahhtchii!!!”</p>\n<p>“You’ve got a flu?” Bhela asked worriedly.</p>\n<p>“Yeah. Aunt Jiji told me to drink my medicine everyday but it’s so bitter. So much bitter that it’s evil!”</p>\n<p>“Where’s your medicine now?”</p>\n<p>“Oh. I throw it away last night.”</p>\n<p>Bhela shook her head.</p>\n<p>“That’s no good. You can’t throw away your medicine like that. Now, wipe your nose. This mister butler said to use this…” she put the handkerchief on Lyla’s nose, and Lyla blew her nose on it.</p>\n<p>Lyla gave back the handkerchief to Butler Tim. “Thank you, Sir Butler. It’s very helpful of you.”</p>\n<p>The butler received back his most precious handkerchief. Bonus Lyla’s snot.</p>\n<p>“Come on inside,” Bhela said to Lyla. “Even if the water runs dry, coconuts still have meat we can scoop. After that we’ll pick some star fruits that I planted since I was a child.”</p>\n<p>“Star fruits! Woohooo!”</p>\n<p>The girls then walked inside. Lyla was so excited she didn’t leave her friend, hanging on her neck like a koala being comfortable on a tree branch. The stories about a noble young lady coming to Malikh Family for Bhela Malikh spread amongst the maidservants like oil being poured on an open wildfire. The Malikhs couldn’t describe the pride seeing their eldest young lady with a blue blood friend. Especially the aunties. They watched how close Bhela and Lyla with teary eyes and happy smiles.</p>\n<p>“Young lady is… finally… finally…”</p>\n<p>“She finally has a friend…”</p>\n<p>“Huuu… huuu… merciful Goddesses finally saw the young lady’s plight and blessed her with a real friend… huuu huuuu….”</p>\n<p>Nobody more happier than the aunties who were familiar with how their Young Lady Bhela lived her live. They silently cried watching their young lady, who usually alone and unapproachable, finally grown up and had her first friend in these past ten years.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Butler Tim grimaced inside. Despite the fact that he was tasked to win over Bhela Malikh with any means necessary, he didn’t like this girl. It wasn’t because his handkerchief got dirty--well, maybe he resented her for it a little--it because the girl named Bhela Malikh wasn’t acting as a young country girl supposed to act. Country bumpkins supposed to falter when they saw the radiance seeped out of the nobles’ aura, they supposed to tremble when they saw the noble wealth glittering beneath the sun. But this girl was indifferent and aloof. She was cold but the coldness paired with concise and elegant mannerism. Butler Tim knew she trying to act noble herself. That was why he didn’t like her.</p>\n<p>However, Butler Tim was a smart person. Any smart person would wear a perfect smile despite his heart bleeding over the snot on his precious handkerchief. Before leaving the city, the butler didn’t forget to look for a gift he’d use to lower the Malikh Family’s guard. He heard the previous gift was rejected, and when he asked for the content of the gift, the smart Butler Tim shook his head as if he knew it would happen.</p>\n<p>Toward country bumpkins, too expensive gifts would never work. He knew this because he was smart. And because he was smart, he knew better gifts. Not-so-expensive gifts worked for country bumpkins.</p>\n<p>Therefore, he presented Bhela Malikh with popular city biscuits.</p>\n<p>“I heard this biscuit is currently very popular among noble young ladies. This butler happened to pass by a store that sold this, so I reckon Young Lady Bhela might love to taste some.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, because the elders roughly knew the Blackwood Family’s youngest lady would come to visit, two leaders of opposing factions came to watch how their Young Lady Bhela would receive the noble guest. Elder Jhamil was all smiling because he liked what he saw. But the expression of Elder Khasim turned sour when he saw how the butler of Blackwood Family tried to butter up to Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>“Don’t accept it, young lady, please….” Elder Khasim whispered under his breath. Of course, there was no single soul heard what he just said. He was worried the hard work to rebuild his faction’s morale all would turn into dust if people thought their spiritual mascot, the one and only Young Lady Bhela Malikh, could be bought with mere biscuits.</p>\n<p>Contrary to what Elder Khasim hoped, Bhela Malikh received the gift without even putting a second thought. A feeling of defeat surged inside him. Elder Jhamil looked at his rival with a mocking glance.</p>\n<p>After receiving the snacks, Bhela excused herself and brought Lyla with her to stroll around Malikh Family’s gardens. Butler Tim pretended to wave his hand and smiled, but inside, he was gloating at how hypocrite Bhela was. His guess that Young Lady Bhela wouldn’t refuse the gift he brought was entirely correct. Before, he deliberately said the biscuit was noble young ladies’ favorite. Thus, according to his smart logic, as long as it wasn’t too expensive that it’d scare this fake young lady, no way a noble wannabe would reject this kind of gifts.</p>\n<p>“Heh,” Butler Tim scoffed when Bhela and Lyla already left. “Bet you’ve never eaten any city biscuits your entire life, haven’t you.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, Bhela Malikh hadn’t had any city biscuits her entire life. Not before and also not today. What Butler Tim didn’t know was that the snacks he bought with his own money ultimately ended up returned to Blackwood Family--to be exact, it ended up inside Lyla Blackwood’s belly. Bhela couldn’t help but received the biscuits when, beside her, she saw Lyla was drooling looking at the biscuits.</p>\n<p>The elders led by Elder Jhamil then respectfully welcomed the butler along with servants and guards from Blackwood Family. From the impression alone, Butler Tim could see reasons for him to like this slick-tongued Elder Jhamil. He knew how to flatter and also he knew how to act humble in front of people with higher status than him. Not like that noble-wannabe Young Lady of Malikh Family. This Elder Jhamil knew that he was only a country bumpkin thus acted accordingly. Naturally, the smart Butler Tim was pleased.</p>\n<p>And so began Butler Tim’s quests to swallow Malikh Family with his smartly planned schemes and cunning political games.</p>\n<p>In mere hours, the neutral elders who hadn’t joined either both rivalling factions began flocking to Elder Jhamil’s side. One part because they wanted to side with the faction that had the noble support and another part simply because Elder Jhamil, with the help of Butler Tim, had been throwing around sweet deals over all directions.</p>\n<p>“Only one tenth of the elder council members don’t want to pick a side by now, but their number is too significant to be an obstacle for Sir Butler’s great plan,” Elder Jhamil reported the current situation to Butler Tim.</p>\n<p>The butler was enjoying a glass of tea served by the maid that supposed to serve Young Lady Lyla Blackwood as if he was the visiting noble himself. He nodded. “I see. With this, the first stage of my plan has been completed.”</p>\n<p>“Oohhh!” Elder Jhamil exclaimed. “Sir Butler summoned rain and fire by flipping Malikh Family’s political scene upside down, and this is only the first stage?! As expected, the Butler of Blackwood Family is very smart!”</p>\n<p>Butler Tim originally wanted to act aloof and sophisticated before he visited this rural village. However, upon being called a smart person, he couldn’t help but grinned widely. “Oho, you’re an interesting fella, aren’t you? Very well, since you’ve done a good job yourself, I won’t be so petty to grab all the credit. Tell me how I should do next, if I like what I hear, we might as well corporate your thoughts into my plan.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was excited. How could he not? An opportunity to rise beyond a mere elder of rural village was laid before him.</p>\n<p>“Sir Butler, you may not know this, but we Mossack people regard having a good meal very highly. Everytime we’re having breakfast or dinner together as the entire family, even though we’re always looked peaceful outside, those trivial events actually are a political battlefield for us elders to extend our influence! This lowly man himself used a few move in the past during breakfast to gather like-minded men under my banner. I used all my resources and connections in a single mealtime to attack my rivals! However, these past two days, my biggest rival used a lowly method against me…”</p>\n<p>“Oh? What did he do?” Butler Tim asked.</p>\n<p>“He didn’t do much,” Elder Jhamil said, sneering when he was talking about this rival of his, “all he did was inviting Young Lady Bhela everytime we were having a meal in the family hall. He’s been a stubborn and ignorant supporter of main family, but this time he actually knew how to use his connection with the main family to deal a blow against me. A few of the elders had been faltering when they saw Young Lady Bhela leaning over the other side; I’m afraid if we’re leaving this ignorant rival of me doing as he wanted, there’s gonna be a hole in Sir Butler’s smart plan!”</p>\n<p>Butler Tim swirled the tea in his cup as though he was deep in thought. Of course, if this proven to endanger his smart plan, the butler couldn’t sit still watching all that happened. “I heard the Mossacks are peculiar people, but I don’t know you Mossack people have a strange custom!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, we’re living here far away from the city, so of course our traditions might seem unsophisticated to wise westerners like Sir Butler,” Elder Jhamil fawned.</p>\n<p>“Then what do you suggest Blackwood Family should do in this situation, Elder Jhamil?”</p>\n<p>“It’s easy!” Elder Jhamil was so excited he almost jumped from his seat. “My rival faction used Young Lady Bhela to gain foothold, and we can also use that to deal a greater blow back to them!”</p>\n<p>“And that is?”</p>\n<p>“Of course, we can use--I mean, we can invite young noble miss to a dinner together with us. With this we can unofficially announce our alliance with Blackwood Family! It’s the final nail to main family’s faction!”</p>\n<p>Even though Bhela Malikh’s status as a Unique Class shone throughout all of Badril Village, her name still fall short with a pure noble like Lyla Blackwood. Madam back in Blackwood Family used her daughter so Blackwood could infiltrate Malikh Family easily, but that didn’t mean Lyla still wasn’t as useful.</p>\n<p>“Very well. Let us go with that,” then he asked the maid responsible for Lyla’s schedule. “What was Young Lady Lyla doing this afternoon?”</p>\n<p>The maid replied, “Young Lady Bhela Malikh carried her around to play. At first, they went to Malikh Family’s orchard to pick some fruits. Then they visited the sick Patriarch Malikh in his room for a few minutes. After that, they went outside to stroll and came back with a new rabbit pet they bought from other family. Finally, when the sun is setting, they went to the kitchen to watch the servants cooking.”</p>\n<p>“How uncouth for a noble young lady being led around in dirty places like that,” Butler Tim was displeased, but nothing he could do since making Bhela’s attention elsewhere meant he could move freely to make a trap for her. Nodding to himself, the butler then gave an instruction to the maid, “you go to Young Lady Lyla and tell that Malikh Family invite her for a dinner.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was excitedly rubbing his hands when Butler Tim said that. Finally, payback to those imbecile Elder Khasim!</p>\n<p>“But, Butler Tim…” the maid hesitated.</p>\n<p>“What is it?”</p>\n<p>“Malikh Family already invited Young Lady Lyla to have dinner. She’s eating in Malikh Family’s hall right now….”</p>\n<p>“Hmm, what do you mean?”</p>\n<p>What the maid meant was that someone in Malikh Family already brought Lyla to have dinner with them.</p>\n<p>When Butler Tim playing political games and scheming around in Malikh Family, Bhela Malikh, along with the elders friendly with Elder Khasim, had been giving bunch of candies and food for Lyla Blackwood, much more than the biscuits Butler Tim brought with him. Being a great foodie herself, Lyla never had enough, the first day in Malikh Family she ate more sweets and foods worth of one week back in Blackwood Family’s manor. Aunt Jiji and other Blackwood Family’s maid servants would freak out if they saw how glutton Lyla currently was.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the news that the main family’s faction hosting a dinner for a noble miss swept Malikh Family like a thunderstorm. The neutral elders Elder Jhamil had just bought flocking back toward Elder Khasim’s side. It was so sudden. Everyone wasn’t even got a breath to process what had happened. And this for sure was an unprecedented move ever since Patriarch Ghalim suddenly fell ill and retreated from the political scene.</p>\n<p>Just as one side was busy completing the first stage to win over the Young Lady of Malikh Family, the other side already won over Young Lady of the noble Blackwood Family. All happened in a span of a single day.</p>\n<p>“Y-young Lady Lyla…”</p>\n<p>Even Butler Tim couldn’t pull his own young miss seeing how happy she was. His plan had been jabbed in a completely unexpected way. Maybe he wasn’t so smart after all.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>It was unfortunate that Madam Malikh didn’t see the Young Noble Miss of Blackwood Family kindly. Even though the girl did nothing wrong, Madam Malikh wasn’t so muddled that she wasn’t aware what Blackwood Family and those corrupt elders conspiring against her husband and Malikh’s main family. Even Bhela herself couldn’t do anything to change her mother’s mind.</p>\n<p>However, Lyla Blackwood, an airhead as she always was, was oblivious of the hostility directed toward her.</p>\n<p>It was morning the second day Lyla in Badril Village. Following her friend Bhela, she carried a little box inside Patriarch Ghalim’s bedroom. This little box filled with custom-made medicines--most were amateurly mixed from two different trivial medicines, consisted of remedies for flu and headache. Nothing harmful but nothing useful at the same time. And just like yesterday, to pay for Bhela parents’ kindness for letting her staying in Malikh Family, Lyla Blackwood decided to play doctor a little bit.</p>\n<p>“Uncle, I’m coming again to help you feel better,” Lyla said as she dragged a chair and sat beside Patriarch Ghalim’s sick bed. Seeing the pale middle-aged man in bed, she blinked her googly eyes, then continued, “how’s yesterday medicine I gave you. Are you feeling a tiny minny bit better, perhaps?”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim certainly was feeling better these past few days, not because Lyla’s medicines, but Grandpa Piss’s diagnosis and remedies. Toward this girl, he weakly nodded. “Thank you for your help, little lady.”</p>\n<p>“Then I’m going to fed you my newest recipe, uncle. Here, here, open your mouth.”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghamil did what he was told. Because Lyla didn’t like bitter medicine, she added lots of brown sugar. Lots and lots of brown sugar.</p>\n<p>“It’s… sweet.”</p>\n<p>“Are you feeling better, now?” Lyla asked.</p>\n<p>“Yes, little lady, I’m feeling better.”</p>\n<p>As a matter of fact, he wasn’t. The medicine was more like a candy than remedy.</p>\n<p>“Good! If you eat this three times a day, maybe your illness would go away, uncle,” Lyla then sternly pointed out, “maybe!”</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh was nervous when her husband consumed the strange medicine Lyla gave him, but she didn’t open her mouth to protest. Bhela was changing the pillows’ sheet nearby, and doing some other chores that usually were done by the servants. In the meantime, Lyla was giving advice for Patriarch Ghalim liked how he should eat moderately three times a day, how he should brush his teeth after he ate sweets, and all the things Aunt Jiji told Lyla all the time.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to visit again, uncle, get well soon!” Lyla waved her hands. Carrying a broom in her hands, Lyla’s next schedule was following Bhela doing chores in the courtyard.</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim weakly waved his hand back. Of course, after the girls were already gone, he noticed his bitter wife biting her lips indignantly.</p>\n<p>“Don’t stare the girl so much. She’s not responsible for her family’s wrongdoings. It’s not like a girl her age knows what her parents do behind the scene.”</p>\n<p>“Why did you eat that? What if they used her to give you more poison?”</p>\n<p>“Bhela wouldn’t let me have the medicine if she didn’t what it was, no? Stop putting that kind of face, you only make our daughter feels awkward about all this.”</p>\n<p>The woman held her husband’s hand, kissing it with her forehead as she hid her face. She whispered, “Oh, don’t you know how hurt this heart holding back my grievance? Why did our daughter had to bring someone from that family inside our roof?” she sniffed, “how long this farce gonna last? What should I do in the mean time? Oh! I don’t know! I don’t know!”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim sighed as he witnessed his wife cried helplessly.</p>\n<p>In the courtyard, near the coops where Malikh Family raised chickens and ducks, Lyla was squatting in front of the new bunny she and Bhela bought just yesterday. She was waiting the whole morning just to feed this bunny. The bunny hopped around, itching to play in spite it couldn’t resist the temptation of delicious green leaves, again and again. Wathing how glutton the bunny was, Lyla found herself immerse in immense joy. She very much envying the life of a bunny. Perhaps that because she could relate to how it spent its day without worry; eating, playing, sleeping, then playing again--a life that she longed to have. If only she was born a rabbit instead of a young lady of noble family….</p>\n<p>The sound of the broom swept the ground took away her attention. Lyla couldn’t understand how a daughter of a patriarch like Bhela had to work so much.</p>\n<p>“Why do you work so much, Sistah?” Lyla asked when she found out there still much dry leaves Bhela had to sweep. “Won’t you get bored soon? Just let the servants clean this place.”</p>\n<p>Bhela, sweeping as if Lyla’s idleness didn’t bother her the slightest, replied, “Here in Badril Village, everyone who hasn’t done their coming of age ceremony has to do chores for their parents. It doesn’t matter if it’s the farmer’s daughter or the biggest family’s young lady, helping the matter of the household is one of the seven virtues we Mossack people get to do for our parents.”</p>\n<p>Originally, Lyla wanted her friend also playing with the bunny. But hearing Bhela just said something serious, there was no way she’d reveal her intention now. “My mom always nagging me to go to dance lesson or whatever. It’s very very boring,” she murmured, a bit dejected.</p>\n<p>“The west and the south have different values,” Bhela said. “Complete your virtue for your parents then you’ll grow to be a fine lady, Lyla.”</p>\n<p>“Uggghhh…” Lyla grunted as she didn’t want to continue the topic any further. She long developed a sense for her own survival to detect whether or not the conversation ended up she being forced to do some boring stuff. Knowing Bhela’s personality, Lyla knew soon Sis Bhela’d make her doing chores too. Grabbing the bunny, Lyla quickly escaped somewhere else so that she could spend her time playing. Bhela shook her head seeing the girl’s behavior.</p>\n<p>Bhela then noticed some servants whispering while they looking at Lyla from the distance. Many people were curious what a noble young lady like her would do in a rural place like this, and Bhela wasn’t that oblivious not to notice the eyes planted by the elders of Malikh Family.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, she then saw four girls dressed in expensive garments approaching Lyla with their mouth covered with feathered fans in their hands. Their clothing looked as if they attending some sort of ceremony, while in fact, they calculated that this kind of appearance was the most suitable for them to socialize with a girl of blue-blooded origin. Bhela recognized the leader of those girls was actually Elder Jhamil’s niece.</p>\n<p>“Have you read Le Armour dan Varoza written by Leornador De Gonzalez, Young Lady Blackwood?”</p>\n<p>“Ah, yes, that piece was adequately sophisticated but I think Vista van Gracious’s omnibus more than adequate, le banjour?”</p>\n<p>“I see, I see, their pieces adequately well-written as those senor themselves adequattely live as maestro. But perhaps equoliette more than fit the diagram as paradigm sensorita abligioate senor des adequately le banjour.”</p>\n<p>“But of course, Young Lady Blackwood is more addequately sophisitacted as it’s a noblesse obligiote to be more sohpisitacated than us village senioritas. Perhaps le banjour is fortuna with de gracious by Young Lady’s great wisdom?”</p>\n<p>Lyla blinked her eyes trying to decipher whatever these girls mean. The bunny in her arms even escaped amidst her confusion.</p>\n<p>“Uhh… uhhh…” Lyla timidly stepped back from the feathered fan girls. “I think Sis Bhela is calling me…”</p>\n<p>She swiftly ran away back to her friend Bhela.</p>\n<p>“Sistah, Sistah Bhela!” Lyla cried and grabbing Bhela’s sloven sleeve tightly, demanding for justice, “they came to bully me!”</p>\n<p>“What did they do?” Bhela asked.</p>\n<p>“They know I can’t speak western language! They came to test me! They’re even worse than those rich girls in seminar--they jumble some western mumbo jumbo into plain language in order to confuse me! They must be laughing and call me stupid by now!”</p>\n<p>Hearing Lyla’s grievance, Bhela patted her head in order to let the girl calmed down.</p>\n<p>“Lyla, those girls are different than the noble girls that always making fun of you.”</p>\n<p>“Different? How so?”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at the girls who also was watching them back while fanning themselves with their fabulous feathered fans.</p>\n<p>“They looked like noble descendants, but actually were not.”</p>\n<p>“I still don’t like them nonetheless!”</p>\n<p>“You don’t have to talk to them if you don’t want to,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>Yet Lyla still restlessly tugging Bhela’s sleeves, making it harder for her to do her chores. Before the peers that always making fun of her, Lyla was always helpless and had been depending on Bhela’s figure as a shield. What it looked like from the point of view of an outsider was a scene where a young mother being tested of her patience dealing with a girl who was throwing a tantrum.</p>\n<p>Seeing that the young noble miss wouldn’t come back soon, the feathered fan girls approaching Bhela and Lyla instead.</p>\n<p>“Oh, fancy to meet Young Lady Bhela here, le banjour!”</p>\n<p>“Le bonjour…” Bhela hesitated to reply back. Tilting her head slightly, she studied the pompously dressed girls before her. These girls were relatives of Malikh Family’s elders. None of them could match with Bhela if talking strictly about social status wise, not to mention talents. However, while she was holding her broom, it looked like Bhela was the one with common origin, while these girls were floating swans who happened to be generous enough to greet plebeians with their <em>unique</em> vocabulary.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Lyla Blackwood hid behind Lyla’s back. Despite a noble origin herself, meeting more cocky and fake young ladies than the girls before her were rare experience for Lyla.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela, fancy to meet you. Good morning. The weather is nice. I eat snails everyday,” Elder Jhamil’s niece took the lead and said that with a hint of inflated pride.</p>\n<p>Bhela narrowed her eyes. She could see why Lyla instantly hated these girls. She then said in a sleek foreign language, “Je ne sais pas de quoi tu parles. Si vous ne parlez pas une langue étrangère, fermez simplement la bouche, sinon vous faites peur aux enfants avec votre non-sens.”</p>\n<p>The feathered fan girls blinked their eyes trying to decipher whatever Bhela had said.</p>\n<p>“Oh, it turns out Young Lady Bhela is aquadettely know some le banjour!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, Young Lady Bhela is adequately sophisticated after all. Me gusta!”</p>\n<p>“I see, I see, le pasta fortuna is delicosaza.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s niece didn’t say anything as she only maintained a sweet smile while being nervous herself. Racking her brains over remembering the contents of thick dictionary, she tried to form a decent sentences in foreign language. But Bhela then cut off her train of thought before she could say a word.</p>\n<p>“Blackwood Family is migrating noble that has long been making their roots here in southern land. Hundred of years living far away from their western peers, noble families like this would naturally become more lax. It’s natural for Lyla to not mastering her homeland’s native tongue.”</p>\n<p>Bhela said that in a straight manner. That was a white lie, however. It was true that many noble families coming from the western side of Tiramikal Continent to forgot their western root and began to see themselves as southerners. But those were usually the case depending right circumstances, like exiled nobles, or some young masters who had lost in political battle branched out and fancied themselves a legit noble family with themselves at the helm. Blackwood Family weren’t exiled nobles, and though Lyla’s ancestors branching out some hundreds of years ago, that didn’t automatically made them cutting off ties with the original family. The main family of Blackwood was back in a western country called Tatalghia Kingdom, still sending letters and envoys from time to time to the branch Lyla was living in--although, undeniably, the southern branch of Blackwood Family had long developed and surpassed the main one.</p>\n<p>It seemed like Bhela already used to tell this lie. Anyone who heard this would be forced to accept it, unless they wanted to spend time and resources digging through the details--which to be honest, none of these pompous young girls were willing or simply unable to go through.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Elder Jhamil’s niece believed Lyla’s family exempt her to excel in foreign language. Yet she was still displeased inside. Her uncle told her that Bhela had been hogging the young noble’s influence for herself, everyone in Malikh Family already knew how Bhela Malikh carrying around the noble young lady yesterday. So what if she had some more bit of talent and had been running around overseas in that whatever seminars she was attending? A bumpkin origin wouldn’t be able to change their bumpkin bloodline. So if Bhela had the right to get close with the Young Lady of Blackwood Family, that meant someone coming from the same family should have the same change as her!</p>\n<p>The elder’s niece said, “Young Lady Bhela, I know the main family is prideful. But Young Lady Blackwood is here to experience the village slow life. Don’t you think she also needs to mingle with us commoners?”</p>\n<p>“Lyla will befriend any person she fancies herself, I don’t control with whom she wants to socialize with,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“If that’s the case, then why she still has no friends other than you?”</p>\n<p>“That’s not true!” Lyla cried indignantly, “I’ve made friends! With aunties! Aunties in the kitchen!”</p>\n<p>It was easy to be friendly with Lyla. She was always unconventional and never saw people by the social system. To her, people only divided by two types, those who gave her food and those who didn’t. She was like a cat. Just bring a good food and she’d be very friendly the next moment.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Lyla’s frank open-mindedness wasn’t easily accepted by some people. Elder Jhamil’s niece gasped as she looked at Lyla and Bhela, back and forth. “My goodness! Young Lady Bhela, were you letting a noble young lady such as Young Lady Blackwood mingle with dirty servants?!”</p>\n<p>“Why wouldn’t I?” Bhela asked back.</p>\n<p>“You--don’t young lady care about our family’s reputation? What if people said we’ve mistreated a noble young lady?”</p>\n<p>“Lyla is here to experience village slow life,” Bhela said slowly, “don’t you think she also needs to mingle with commoners?”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s niece was speechless as Bhela used her own words. The contorted expression on her chaky make-up face brought satisfaction for Lyla, who then snorted.</p>\n<p>“What now? Kitty got your tongue?” Lyla said with her mouth pouted. “So that you know, Sis Bhela already made speechless many many bullies like you! Who were many many many times smarter than you! This is what you get by making fun of me--shame on you, hmph! Who’s the stupid one, now?”</p>\n<p>Even after losing a round of squabble against Young Lady Bhela, unexpectedly the nobly young lady herself became hostile against her. All was so sudden that it made blood drained from her face.</p>\n<p>Bhela ruffled Lyla’s hair. Apparently Lyla still believed these girls came to bully her. When Lyla already made up her mind to not liking someone, it was hard to bend on her opinion.</p>\n<p>“Let’s go, Lyla. We’ll help aunties make sweets for afternoon lunch,” Bhela said. Back in the seminars, when Bhela asked Lyla to do some chores, the supposed noble young lady of Blackwood Family would move slowly, occasionally pouting and murmuring some complaints, unwilling to exert her calories on some boring stuff. However, it was different if the destination was kitchen. The spirit of lively bunny would come to possess her--she’d jolt, sprinting, unwilling to waste time as the promise of free sweets and delicious salty snacks was revealed before her.</p>\n<p>“What was that about?!” one of the le bonjour girls scowled after Bhela and Lyla was gone. “How could a young lady speaks like that?”</p>\n<p>“Bhela must lead her around to act like that! Did you hear what she said? The noble young lady thinks we bully her or something.”</p>\n<p>“Aahhh! What a manipulative bitch! I really want to know what that little cunt said to make Young Lady Blackwood think we had made fun of her. No way in hell someone would dare making fun of a noble like her!”</p>\n<p>Actually, Lyla was made fun of so many times. Especially during her study in the seminars abroad. She made fun of so much that she formed a survival instinct to hide behind Bhela’s back. But they didn’t know that. They just assumed as a young lady coming from a noble family, Lyla Blackwood would be adequately pure noble in stories and gossip. The main reason Bhela brought Lyla away was so that Lyla didn’t have to mingle with these delusional le bonjour girls.</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-3/chapter-1-5":"<p>A fifteen years old boy played a game of chess against a spirit. Yesterday, he won a ghastly old encyclopedia nobody ever heard of. Today, the bet he eyed was silver coins. He didn’t know what he wanted from his opponent for tomorrow’s game. But the spirit in this dashing leather armor, adventurer-style, always wanted one thing for the game’s prize: taking control of the boy’s mortal body.</p>\n<p>More than a hundred games of chess later, the boy still got his healthy body intact, he never lost even once. And that made the spirit grow more dissatisfied as the days passing by.</p>\n<p>“Holy ff--! I clearly remember this damn bishop wasn’t there,” the spirit said. From the look of it, he was two moves away from getting his king owned.</p>\n<p>The boy clicked his tongue. He was hearing that kind of excuse every time the chess game came to its end.</p>\n<p>The spirit stubbornly closed the gap in his defense by sacrificing a rook. But soon, without taking a time to think, the boy casually moved his one horse, eating away the queen, sealing all the chance for the spirit to counter-attack.</p>\n<p>“Fuck this shit!!!”</p>\n<p>Enraged, the spirit flipped the chess board. About a dozen chess pieces hurled all side as they became the victims of the spirit’s frustration. The boy sighed. This was no good. Apparently he needed to be more considerate for the next game. He needed to pretend struggling before he crushed this impatient spirit so he didn’t feel cornered and ended up abandoning all these easy-money making games.</p>\n<p>“Hey,” the boy said. He tapped the flat-surfaced stone they used to lay the chess board before and reminded the spirit, almost as if he was saying “put the money here.”</p>\n<p>As annoyed as he was, the spirit could do nothing but give him a pouch of coins.</p>\n<p>“They are not kobes,” the boy said. “Shops and stalls in the village only accept kobe coins.”</p>\n<p>The spirit scoffed.</p>\n<p>“What do you know about it, brat. If you convert with the last week rate then you’ve got twice the shitty kobe you extort from me. Be glad about it.”</p>\n<p>“This won’t do, Ol’ Nalaq. The peddlers that come around here rarely accept strange currency. Neighbor country’s money is usually fine but I don’t think these coins would do. I don’t even know which country these coins are from.”</p>\n<p>“Then use it to add your savings,” the spirit said. “And don’t call me Nalaq. Don’t push your primitive tribal nonsense to me. Call me ‘Good-Natured Spirit’ as usual. I’m not like your usual Nalaqs, brat.”</p>\n<p>“It’s not tribal.” The boy didn’t show any sign of agreement. He didn’t know why this roguish-grinning spirit didn’t like to be called a Nalaq. The way southern Mossack people, like the boy himself, addressed spirits were usually by two terms: Nalaq and Selaq. As far as he knew Nalaq was a title worth to be proud of.</p>\n<novel-trivia label=”Lore”>\n<p>Nalaq were those of the spirit of fallen heroes and mages, had attained high-level of enlightenment to see ways to preserve souls across death. Whilst no longer to be alive, Nalaqs own their consciousness and retain their memories as well intelligence, though part of their original power diminished, especially those who relied on physical might during their prime.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Selaqs arose from death through unnatural causes, sometimes fueled by resentment and great energy of negativity. Though more powerful, their spirit didn’t dissipate because of strong, usually vile, emotions their harbour when they died, the restless spirits stuck in the limbo and returned back to the mortal world as hostile, mindless haunting spectres.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>Theoretically the spirit that currently playing chess was a Nalaq. He still got his consciousness, true. But, in a way, his intelligence seemed way apart from the Nalaqs southern Mossack tribes often revered in the past--that was what the boy had in mind when looking at this vulgar grinning spirit.</p>\n<p>“You’re not thinking something stupid about me, are you?” the spirit said with a snort as he realized the unexcited eyes the boy had as if he was looking at cow dung.</p>\n<p>“No, I was thinking just the usual--I was wondering about your very existence and your real identity.”</p>\n<p>“That so?” the spirit raised his chin. “Don’t need overthinking it, boy. Hehe. If you know even a piece of my name then you’d be amazed by how amazing I am. Everybody is my bitch when I’m still your age back then, hehe. That’s true.”</p>\n<p>“Hooohhh…” the boy half-heartedly nodded. As expected, every time he brought the topic about the spirit’s identity, all he got was empty talks, disgusting enough for him to regret for bringing up the topic. For now, the only joyous thing he got to do was counting the money he won from the chess game as the bullshit Good-Natured Spirit sang about his past tuning endlessly in the background.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Somewhere in Tiramikal Continent, far in the opposite side of the cold, barbaric northern lands, not too isolated from the bustling early-capitalistic empires of the western lands, and not too far away from the neighbor eastern lands of never-ending warfares between the eastern Kaya feudal lords, a village known as Badril Village was living peaceful for a number of years. The old blood the locals knew as Badril Village’s three big families rooted deeply these past one hundred years in spite of the thinning southern Mossack heritage. Despite slowly developing their rural village worthy of the westerner tourists and easterners refugees, the southern locals still taking pride in their Mossack hunters and gatherers ancestry. Exactly one year ago Good-Natured Spirit appeared in this humble village.󠆞</p>\n<p>On the wall of Yashura Family’s courtyard, which was ridiculously thick and tall for ordinary villages, the spirit took out a rolled paper of dried tobacco. This might not be common knowledge known only to limited people; for converting earthly materials to spiritual goods for Nalaqs to use, it could only be done in an expensive and complicated manner--usually performed in rituals by the royalties and great ancient clans for annual offerings to their ancestors. But the spirit in shabby leather armor did the converting for cigarettes and other trivial goods. Nobody knew how he did it. Even if they did, it’d be very hard to judge whether his quirk was worth to be admired or to be ridiculed at. Nevertheless he got this kind of air around him that telling people he didn’t care much about what they think.</p>\n<p>The street below the wall were children below ages of ten playing with sticks and chasing each other. When a crowd of housewives came, his eyes, sharp as an eagle’s, sweeping through in search of prey. One of his habit that obviously he brought with him since he was alive was to oogle women, especially for young wives and pretty middle-aged aunties interesting big breasts and interesting big butts. Despite his sighing and occasional annoying tongue-clicking, though, those wives and children didn’t turn their heads toward him. They didn’t even know a lecher ghost was there haunting the street. A Nalaq couldn’t be seen by common folks by default. Unless he wanted to, no one would realize there was a suspicious spirit ogling for women that were passing by.</p>\n<p>There was a young woman he knew trotted the street. Good-Natured Spirit knew her. She was neither a wife nor she was an aunty. Her butt and breasts sizes were also not worth being fusing about. The name was Mila Yashura, seventeen years old since last month. She was the older cousin of the boy he lost playing chess to.</p>\n<p>“Aunty,” Mila greeted an aunty by lowering her head, “did you see my cousin Shira around here?”</p>\n<p>The local wife she asked shook her head. Mila Yashura said a polite thanks and continued searching for her cousin.</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit swept the street with his eyes, looking for something. When he saw a certain manservant he stopped. Using his spiritual knife, he dismantled a small pebble from the stone wall he sat on, flicked it using his thumb and knocked the manservant’s head with it.</p>\n<p>“Ouch!” the manservant cried.</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura abruptly turned her head and saw a manservant of her Yashura Family holding his head. She briskly coming to him and asked the same question she threw to the aunty before.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira?” the manservant glanced at the direction of the hill behind Yashura Family’s wall. “I saw him walking there at noon. But whether he has returned or not I don’t know.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you. That’s good enough. Here, treat yourself some coffee beans before the peddlers set for the next village.”</p>\n<p>The hill behind the Yashura Family’s dwelling was originally a place where the family members brought the family’s goats to graze its green grasses. But under the current patriarch’s management, the family’s fortunate mostly put on investing on coconut plantations, thus some grazing places were left unused.</p>\n<p>“Shira! So here’s you holing yourself. I’ve been searching you for nearly an hour,” Mila saw how her cousin who was two years younger than her enjoying himself lying under a shadowy tree, using his arms as pillows. She kicked his foot, yelling him to get up, but Shira merely changed his position and groaned in protest.</p>\n<p>“This buffon…” Mila hissed. “You know how the fact you’re lazing around everyday breeds all those crappy rumors, don’t you?”</p>\n<p>“People can talk whatever they want as long as they don’t bother me,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“But they bother our family!”</p>\n<p>Mila inhaling a deep breath. Now her voice getting higher annoyingly and she continued, “You’re the young master of our family, you lazy pig. The nearest in-line to inherit the patriarch title! You may don’t give a shit about your reputation now but if you are to take the leader's mantle from my father then all the crap they said would certainly bite your ass in the future! You hear?!”</p>\n<p>Shira picked his ear coolly. He might not know anything about the future, but certainly his cousin’s annoying nagging was biting his ass at this moment.</p>\n<p>“What are you doing alone in this kind of place anyway?”</p>\n<p>“You might not believe it, but I’m making a fortune here,” Shira said. Of course, whenever he played a game of chess with a spirit invisible to ordinary humans, he needed a quiet place where nobody was around. This was a perfect place for him.</p>\n<p>But Mila winced her eyes. A few seconds later, she turned her head, catching a canvas filled with rough sketches resting on the tree.</p>\n<p>“By painting?”</p>\n<p>“Sometimes that too.” Shira knew a bit about drawing scenery and people, so even with his limited interpersonal connection as an introvert he could make some money with his painting. However, his casual reply got Mila in a bad mood instead. Suddenly Shira remembered the embarrassing accident two months ago when Mila found an unfinished commision from a certain good-for-nothing spirit that he had carefully hidden in his house. When people commissioned a no-name painter they mostly asked for a portrait or image they deemed interesting. What kind of images Good-Natured Spirit found interesting? Women, of course. Especially those with big butts and big breasts. He liked them in thin, slipping clothings as if those vulnerable ladies were stuck in a very dangerous situation. In other words, erotic paintings.</p>\n<p>Then, sighing at the explosive nagging coming his way, Shira took a stick he slipped on his right ear and presented it as a bribe. Ancient southern Mossacks used berries and some used squid inks as pigments, but after waves of outside influence they started using quills and brushes, depending on the regions. Pencils, although practical, were introduced by a certain Nalaq spirit and Shira hadn’t heard anyone using it beside himself. The stick he used as a bribe was exactly a pencil. It sharpened many times and half-way on its way before he needed another one. Shira thought, maybe he should extort some more pencils for the next match from Good-Natured Spirit.</p>\n<p>Mila furrowed. She knew about the pencil and its value not too long ago thus, as expected, she grabbed it shamelessly. “What? Do you think you can escape only with this?”</p>\n<p>“I planned to give you something else but I think you’d rather like this simple bribe anyway.”</p>\n<p>Shira wanted to simply give her money to make her shut up. But the coins he had on him now only in form of foreign currency--the coins he extorted from Good-Natured Spirit from the last chess game. The boy frowned. Beside nagging him at full force, what did Mila coming here for?</p>\n<p>“Yeah, that reminds me, the news I wanted to tell you!” Mila finally snapped out of her nagging mode. “That Malikh girl! Your fiancée! After two years abroad! She’s finally coming home!”</p>\n<p>“Ohh…” the reply was anticlimactic.</p>\n<p>“Ohh? What the fuck with that reply?”</p>\n<p>“You don’t mind me. I just already burn out when people compare me with her,” Shira said. Although their age were the same, this young lady of Malikh Family was famous even in the nearby villages and town as a talent, with a promising look that might make her a beauty worth dying for. The old generations called her treasure and the boys loved her as the village princess. She went abroad two years ago for a series of seminars after an official from the capital scouted her talent. Now that she returned, everybody was fervently talking about her. But for Shira Yashura, the boy who was supposed to be the fiancé, even that kind of news wasn’t enough to make him get up from his comfortable napping.</p>\n<p>“My father wants to talk with you,” Mila said, “get up now.”</p>\n<p>“What about?”</p>\n<p>“You still asking?”</p>\n<p>The boy had a premonition that a troublesome matter would be waiting for him. Mila gave him an ultimatum before she wandered off to do her own things.</p>\n<p>“Hehe, what’s this fiancée I heard just now?” Good-Natured Spirit popped out his head from a tree beside Shira.</p>\n<p>“It’s not what you think,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“Oh yeah?” Good-Natured Spirit nudged the boy with his elbow. “I heard that chick is a hella beauty. Hehe, I bet her luggages is in good-quality, you know what I mean?”</p>\n<p>“From whom did you hear that?”</p>\n<p>“Doesn’t matter who. When it comes to chick my radar is very sensitive, eh. I’m curious. Did you benefit from this engagement thingy? Benefit, know what I mean?”</p>\n<p>Shira clicked his tongue. “Like I said, it’s not what you think it is. Our parents set us up and it’s been a mess since the talks about engagement got out.”</p>\n<p>Talking some sense to this good-for-nothing Nalaq was futile. Good-Natured Spirit kept teasing him. “You haven’t seen her for two years, have you? The talks I’ve been hearing down there real hairy, brat. I mean… especially those luggages of hers, know what I mean? Know what I mean? Nudge nudge. Nudge nudge,” he winked. “Wanna check on her?”</p>\n<p>“I need to go back. My uncle wants to talk with me.”</p>\n<p>“Alright then,” Good-Natured Spirit nodded as he rubbed his chin. “I’ll check the chick myself.”</p>\n<p>Carrying the canvas and the chess with him, Shira warned the Nalaq, “You better not do anything funny to her, hear me?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho. Jealous?”</p>\n<p>“I just don’t want their entire family coming right after me with pitchforks just because yo do something stupid.”</p>\n<p>After he said that Shira Yashura turned around. He started to walk down the hill. Good-Natured Spirit saw the boy walk without caring for the world, then he set off to check the girl by himself with a chuckle that escaped from his mouth.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A few hours later the said fiancée showed herself in a public training field. The field, owned by the most influential family in Badril Village--the Elzhier Family--was neatly arranged with archery targets and provided with dulled swords for the teenagers trained themselves or doing mock battles. The Elzhiers sent some menservants occasionally to act as security in case conflicts would occur. Today, the young master of the said family himself, nicknamed Bony, guarded the entrance along with two of his lackeys.</p>\n<p>“I’ve got to pay you to enter?!” a young man gawked at the sudden irregularity regarding the training field’s rules. “What’s this? The field is supposed to be free for everyone!”</p>\n<p>“Well, man, gotta pay for maintenance cost,” one of the lackeys, called Pilek, said as he rubbed his nose.</p>\n<p>“One silver kobe! Heh, maintenance cost my ass! Nobody would pay for this bullshit.”</p>\n<p>“Nobody? You wrong, man,” another lackey called Polio pointed at the crowd inside the training field with a gesture of his head. The girl from the Malikh Family causing a big ruckus from her arrival alone. She attracted boys like a bright lamp attracted fireflies. Because of that, the three deliquents in the entrance for nearly half an hour had been amassing quite a fortune till now.</p>\n<p>“I’ll definitely send complaints to Elzhier Family now. Just because your father is the village head you think you can do whatever you want, eh?” the young man snorted, sending a glare to them.</p>\n<p>The Elzhier Family’s young master, who had been watching with his back resting on the wall and his arms crossed, decided to open his mouth, he said, “Pay or get lost.”</p>\n<p>“Hear that? Boss Bony has spoken,” Pilek glared back at the young man with his head tilted. “Better get lost now or else…”</p>\n<p>“Or else!” Polio emphasized with a higher voice.</p>\n<p>The three of them had been infamous in the village despite being heirs to their respective families. Naturally, though they were the same age, only an idiot would butting head directly with the heir of Elzhier Family. Thus the young man snorted, unwillingly turned and walked away.</p>\n<p>“What the heck is that?” Pilek didn’t like the way that young man snorted at them. “We should teach bastards like him a few good lessons one of these days.”</p>\n<p>“You’re right,” Polio added.</p>\n<p>“Just ignore that bum,” Bony said.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, the next onlookers came. Not boys, but two girls to be exact. They carried bags of dirty clothes with them as they were on their way to wash the clothes at the river.</p>\n<p>“Well, I’d be damned,” one of the girls, a young lady named Romana, said, “I’ve been hearing about the rumors but looking at that Malikh girl, damn…. Look at how she did with her hair, Mila.”</p>\n<p>They could see what was happening in the field even from the entrance. The two girls looked at a certain girl who was surrounded by boys. The other girl, Mila Yashura, furrowed her brows at the current appearance of her cousin’s fiancée. She kept her mouth shut despite the anger on her eyes.</p>\n<p>“She cut her hair short despite being engaged to your cousin,” Romana said to Mila. “What’s that supposed to mean?”</p>\n<p>It was a custom of southern Mossack people for women to cut their hair short to tell the opposite sex they currently unavailable. Mostly widows who weren’t ready to be courted again chose to cut their hair that way. However, since the young lady of Malikh Family was currently engaged, the act of cutting her hair short was confusing to people.</p>\n<p>From the three delinquents who had been hearing their conversations, Pilek butted in, “Yo, ladies, don’t think too much about it. We southern people been foreigners with this fiancé-and-fiancée business. We practical people, y’know? Southerners the kind of people who would do it first then talking ‘bout marriage later. A chance she might not know what she was doing.”</p>\n<p>Romana rolled her eyes. Knowing Mila Yashura was here, she wished this stupid cheerful delinquent wouldn’t say what he had said. In fact, better for him to not open his mouth. She hated him whenever he opened his mouth and said pointless things.</p>\n<p>Her and Mila’s goal was to check about the rumor regarding the fiancée’s short hair. They didn’t have the intention to enter the training field and mingle with those crowdy horny boys, lest talking with these shameless thugs who clearly act as bandits.</p>\n<p>“Let’s go, Mila,” Romana whispered as she realized Mila had been glaring at the three delinquents. Moving her eyes from Mila, she looked at Bony who was in between his two lackeys. She whispered again, “you can’t fight him like you used to. He got a Knight class now. People said he can even fight another Knight with four level above him. Let’s just forget about it.”</p>\n<p>Last time Mila and Bony fought was three years ago. Her punch made his nose bleed but that was the end of it. It was a hot topic for a while and most didn’t know what happened but the long enmity between the two of them suddenly dropped cold and they had been avoiding each other. Seeing how the other party was quite well, Mila Yashura grimaced. They were Novices back then but now, after both of them ascended the first level barrier and got themselves class titles, there was no way a support-class Specialist like her could deliver that kind of punch again to his face.</p>\n<p>“Mm. Let’s go,” Mila said to Romana. No matter how brave and reckless she was, as a non-combatant talent, she knew better than to sow another discord with the village’s young generation’s strongest.</p>\n<p>Pilek, the most cheerful in Bony’s group, who was actually the most friendly, waved his hand to the girls as they walked away. Neither of them bothered with him.</p>\n<p>“Ahhh, my sister’s been avoiding me lately,” Pilek grumbled. Romana, Mila’s friend, was actually his half-sister from different mother. He was a proud big brother when they were young, until their mothers had a fight and his half-sister moved into a separate house.</p>\n<p>“Pilek,” Bony called.</p>\n<p>“Yes boss?”</p>\n<p>“You should’ve kept your mouth shut.”</p>\n<p>Pilek wryly smiled and nodded. Polio also thought his friend Pilek couldn’t read between the line. Although Pilek’s remark was well-intentioned, it’d just make things worse for Bony. The bad mood from back three years ago still left after taste that made him and her uncomfortable dealing with each other.</p>\n<p>After that, more people were coming to see the young lady of Malikh Family.</p>\n<p>The talks and speculations about her hair made the boys think she was dissatisfied with her engagement with Shira Yashura. Thus giving them hopes to snatch her away. It was no exaggeration to say that most of the boys fell for her, especially after they saw how the young lady grew beautifully. They surrounded this girl who had this icy expression on her face, though she herself greatly concentrated on holding a bow and an arrow, eyes straight to the archery target dozens of meters from her. She shot. And when the arrow hit splendidly, the boys would cheer and fawn all over her. The girl kept her face cold despite the flooding flattery coming at her way.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” a young man in his early twenty stepped forward from the bunch of admirers and confidently said, “I see you have this different aura about you. Something special that I can’t quite get my fingers on it, and I can’t help but feel curious about you.”</p>\n<p>That was supposed to be a pick-up line, but Bhela Malikh replied straightforwardly, “I changed. Now I’m Level 10 and not a Novice anymore.”</p>\n<p>“Oooohhhh!!” the crowd was surprised. Reaching the first barrier and got a class title at fifteen years old was the second time in these two decades. The first one was Bony. However, considering the girl was quite a talent enough for people in the capital to notice her, there was a high chance for her to snatch the crown as Badril Village’s young generation’s strongest from Bony sooner than everyone expected.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” the young man called for her attention again, despite his first attempt at hitting on her was an utter failure. “I see your beautiful sharp eyes and beautiful nimble hands and your beautiful pretty face. The class you’ve got must be… a beautiful <b>Archer</b>, right?”</p>\n<p>“I am an archer,” Bhela replied tight-lipped. Well, it was obvious when she picked a bow the first thing she arrived here.</p>\n<p>“Ah, a beautiful and talented Archer then! It’s a pity, though for such a fine beautiful flower like yourself to be thrown into a heap of cow dung…”</p>\n<p>The remark made Bhela Malikh raise her brows. She somehow could predict where the topic was going to be directed.</p>\n<p>“That stupid engagement is what I say! How could a diamond such as yourself be forced to marry a trash from Yashura Family?”</p>\n<p>He sighed like he pitied the harsh fate of the beauty. And though unlikeable as he was, the murmurs of the crowd seemingly agreed with him. At that point, someone said, “That’s true. Even my ten years old nephew is one Level above him. Such trash to become…”</p>\n<p>The words stopped, Bhela looked at the person who said that. “The one from Yashura Family--he’s still a Level 3 Novice?”</p>\n<p>It was someone else who replied to her question. “Ah, yes, he’s stuck and made no progress even since Young Lady Bhela went outside the village. Everyone calls him The Eternal Novice.”</p>\n<p>And this made her raised brows turned into a frown. Going by the crowd, for a Level 5 Novice by fifteen years old was already considered slow progress even by the standard of rural places like Badril Village. Mostly at that age the youngsters already reached Level 7, the diligent ones could reach Level 8 with hard work. Faster than that, not counting usage of an unreasonable amount of growth-hack potions--which most children from rich noble families did, could be considered a talent amongst the younger generation. However, to think of a boy one year before his own coming-of-age ceremony coming still stuck at such low-level talent, even though if he was the heir of Badril Village’s major families, people would still call him trash, even in public.</p>\n<p>“Ah, Young Lady Bhela! You don’t have to bother yourself with such eyesore trash. I know you’re troubled with the careless arrangement your father made, but if we put our mind to it, we can--”</p>\n<p>All was well until the young man put bad words about her father. Never did he expect that the girl would mercilessly retract her hand just before the tips of their fingers touched.</p>\n<p>“Please don’t pretend you were familiar with me,” that was what she said.</p>\n<p>The rain of snickers rang all around him. Despite him glaring left and right in an intimidating manner, there was no way for him to suppress the crowd from humiliating him further. At the time he realized the chance for him to court the Young Lady of Malikh Family, the sole daughter of the Malikh Family Patriarch, was pitifully close to nothing. Thus, in a moment of spontaneity, he thought of a scheme to save his face and sounded it with a flash of desperate smirk plastered on his face. He grabbed a bow and said, “I see Young Lady Bhela rather reserved toward us long friends after two years abroad. Hmm, yeah, this is a perfect chance, by the way. I’m an Archer too, see. So why not this senior teach you a thing or two? Seventy meters--perhaps a good learning experience for young lady, no?”</p>\n<p>The surrounding began chattering lively. It was obvious it was a challenge as Archers. And the young man’s smirk turned more and more confident at the girl’s unresponsiveness. No matter how much potential talent one had, time and experience playing a vital role in assessing one’s current performance whether she was Archer or Priest or Knight or other classes. Skills, abilities one acquired after reaching the first barrier and getting a new class title could only progress with constant tempering in battle and improved alongside one’s level. The young man was a Level 12 Archer. So theoretically, a Level 10 new Archer like Bhela Malikh would need a few more years before she could beat the opponent in a fair competition.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh was annoyed. She glared at the ones who were supposed to be guarding the field. But Bony and his lackeys were busy counting coins. For Bhela, the crowd were a bunch of stupid annoying busybodies who prevented her to train in peace. But for Bony and his lackeys the crowd was simply a bunch of gold mines.</p>\n<p>“Please watch closely how I do it, Young Lady Bhela. See my elbow? If you could do the same way I do it, I’m sure your archery skill would improve significantly.”</p>\n<p>No one really bothered with the ‘humble direction’ the young man spouted. Bhela didn’t spare him a glance. She looked straight to target seventy meters from where she was standing. Repressing his anger, the young man began to shoot three arrows one by one splendidly; the final one landed right in the center of the target that was marked in red dot.</p>\n<p>He was satisfied with the result. Glancing at the young lady, this young man wanted to utter more words to improve his image. However, right before he opened his mouth, he found Bhela already drew her arrow, released it, and it hit one arrow splendidly. Not just hitting the target, but an arrow the young man previously shot. The second was the same. And the final third arrow also hit the arrow on the red dot.</p>\n<p>What was that? She used a skill? The young man wanted to object but his tongue froze and his lips quivered. Did she use <b>Far Sight</b> skill that enhanced eye-sight a hundred of meters away? Did she use <b>Boost Accuracy</b>, the skill that was supposedly forbidden to be used in duel between Archers? To think of beating him, an Archer older than her and 2 Level right above her, in such a devastating manner… she must be cheating, right?</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” the defeated young man said weakly, “I didn’t use my mana between my shots.”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh nodded.</p>\n<p>“Neither was I.”</p>\n<p>With that, Bhela turned around and left the crowd of dumbfounded boys with steps full of grace. She approached the entrance, returned back the bow she used to the three delinquents who just let people mess with her training and said coldly, “If this is how the famous Young Master Elzhier manages his property, then there’s no need for me to come here again. Please excuse me.”</p>\n<p>Bony’s expression didn’t change much as he still crossed his arms and rested his back casually on the wall.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Pilek, the one received the returned bow from Bhela, waved his hand again and shouted, “Take care, princess!”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Because she couldn’t train her archery peacefully in public, Bhela returned back to Malikh Family and trained in her private training place.</p>\n<p>It was originally a backyard turned archery ground, made by Malikh Family Patriarch after knowing his daughter showed interest in archery. It was nothing fancy. It was spacious and good enough when she started with her first bow but now Bhela felt the place was lacking. At most, she had to live with the meager fifty meters range maximum. Therefore, the practice she had made a habit of had to wait.</p>\n<p>Therefore, Bhela Malikh decided to put her mind over something else than her usual practice instead.</p>\n<p>She drew a deep breath. A table was provided with dozens of arrows laid on top of it. Bhela picked four at the same time, nocked them on her bow string. She began to aim.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the air surrounding her changed. Her inexperience as a newly Novice-graduate showed by the obvious mana that leaked from the inside out. With naked eyes, her mana looked calm colorful haze that consisted of four bold colors, tangling and struggling with each other for dominance. Her eyelashes quivered. Channeling mana to cast a skill she yet had mastered felt like trying to stand on the raging sea waves while she herself was being a weak newborn.</p>\n<p><em>Whhhhuuuuushh--</em></p>\n<p><em>Shuuuhsh--</em></p>\n<p><em>Ssshhhuuuush--</em></p>\n<p><em>Wwhuuuussh!!</em></p>\n<p>The fastest arrow, coated with sparking yellow-colored mana, hit one of the targets at around forty meters range. But the others performed pitifully. The one infused with wet blue-colored mana didn’t even reach two-third of the desired range. The green-colored one, an arrow infused with mana that generated unstable wind trajectory flew far far away, as if it was getting swallowed by the sky, never to be seen again. The last one, the red-colored arrow, was horrifying. It hit the training ground fence instead the target. The bamboo fences suddenly set ablaze by raging flames as soon as the said arrow came into contact with them.</p>\n<p><em>Clap clap clap!</em></p>\n<p>Uninvited claps resounded across the training ground. On the wall Good-Natured Spirit clapping after watching a good spectacle. For getting hand claps from a Nalaq like him, naturally the level of talent Bhela showed just now was far beyond ordinary.</p>\n<p>“Thank you…” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>It appeared she knew beforehand the four-arrows skill she shot would make a mess. So she gathered the maidservants and made them extinguish the fences that started to burn into ashes. “Thank you, thank you for your hard work,” she said to a pair of maidservants who briskly went back and forth to kill the fire before its spread.</p>\n<p>“Ah! Young lady, what skill was that just now?” one of the maidservants gawked after the fire was extinguished.</p>\n<p>“That wasn’t just your ordinary Archer skill, was it?” added the other.</p>\n<p>Summoning a blazing fire just with an arrow and pure mana was unheard of. At least, the maidservants knew nobody in the village could do that.</p>\n<p>Bhela drank a glass of murky liquify herbs mixed with mint to cool down her manasphere. “It’s something I learned when I was away,” she said after putting down the glass on the tray her maid servants provided. She continued, “I still can’t master it, though.”</p>\n<p>She cast her eyes at the unharmed targets one by one. Shooting at forty meters range was still too much for her using four arrows at the same time. When the maidservants realized her difficulty, they encouraged her to simplify it and shoot one arrow at a time. However at their suggestion, Bhela shook her head. “It’s the requirement of this skill I’ve got to shoot four arrows,” she explained.</p>\n<p>The maidservants nodded at her words and apologized for their shallow suggestion.</p>\n<p>“Don’t mind that,” Bhela waved her hand. “There’s something I heard from people, by the way. Something about Young Master Yashura.”</p>\n<p>The two maidservants glanced at each other before one of them replied. “The rumor says… he holed up from the public’s view because he’s ashamed he can’t even become a Level 4 Novice.”</p>\n<p>“Are the Yashura Family elders still favoring him as the heir of Yashura Family Patriarch?”</p>\n<p>“We don’t know whether they still favor him or not. But Yashura Family always united in their standing. So unless the current Patriarch of Yashura Family has a son, the Young Master Shira Yashura will undoubtedly become the next patriarch.”</p>\n<p>“No rumors about the Yashura Family elders wavering then?”</p>\n<p>The maidservants shook their heads altogether.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela… apologize for giving you my shallow suggestion once again but…” one of the maidservants came near to Bhela and whispered, “With him as the heir, Yashura Family’s future will be bleak. Everyone in our family said your father’s bad condition is a bad omen for us mingling with those simple Yashuras. I’m very sorry if this sounds impudent--but you should’ve better cut ties with them before too late, young lady. Madam was too grieved by your father’s ill health to make decisions thus the only one who can save our Malikh Family is you.”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at the maidservant. The glint on her eyes changed.</p>\n<p>“There’s already a plan laid to help our Malikh Family,” that was all Bhela said. “You better not say something like that again. You lucky no one here beside me to hear you utter that kind of words.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you for your mercy, young lady! We are sorry for being impudent!”</p>\n<p>They decided to make it history with only the four of them who knew the previous conversation. The four of them; the young lady and two maid servants and one Nalaq spirit who came here uninvited.</p>\n<p>“It seems I just heard something I shouldn’t hear,” Good-Natured Spirit said while he rubbed his chin. He came here peeking. He didn’t have the intention to reveal himself while the girls below had a secret conversation ignorant of his presence.</p>\n<p>After that Bhela continued with light training. Good-Natured Spirit watched her doing simple shooting, she didn’t even use a slightest of her mana from then on. Yawning, Good-Natured Spirit stood up. Then he flew away from Malikh Family and began to look for some other interesting thing to sate his boredom.</p>\n<hr>\n<authors-note id=\"Radhy\">\n<p>Testing, testing.

Yesterday, he won a ghastly old encyclopedia nobody ever heard of. Today, the bet he eyed was silver coins. He didn’t know what he wanted from his opponent for tomorrow’s game. But the spirit in this dashing leather armor, adventurer-style, always wanted one thing for the game’s prize: taking control of the boy’s mortal body.</p>\n<p>More than a hundred games of chess later, the boy still got his healthy body intact, he never lost even once. And that made the spirit grow more dissatisfied as the days passing by.</p>\n<p>“Holy ff--! I clearly remember this damn bishop wasn’t there,” the spirit said. From the look of it, he was two moves away from getting his king owned.</p>\n<p>The boy clicked his tongue. He was hearing that kind of excuse every time the chess game came to its end.</p>\n<p>The spirit stubbornly closed the gap in his defense by sacrificing a rook. But soon, without taking a time to think, the boy casually moved his one horse, eating away the queen, sealing all the chance for the spirit to counter-attack.</p>\n<p>“Fuck this shit!!!”</p>\n<p>Enraged, the spirit flipped the chess board. About a dozen chess pieces hurled all side as they became the victims of the spirit’s frustration. The boy sighed. This was no good. Apparently he needed to be more considerate for the next game. He needed to pretend struggling before he crushed this impatient spirit so he didn’t feel cornered and ended up abandoning all these easy-money making games.</p>\n<p>“Hey,” the boy said. He tapped the flat-surfaced stone they used to lay the chess board before and reminded the spirit, almost as if he was saying “put the money here.”</p>\n<p>As annoyed as he was, the spirit could do nothing but give him a pouch of coins.</p>\n<p>“They are not kobes,” the boy said. “Shops and stalls in the village only accept kobe coins.”</p>\n<p>The spirit scoffed.</p>\n<p>“What do you know about it, brat. If you convert with the last week rate then you’ve got twice the shitty kobe you extort from me. Be glad about it.”</p>\n<p>“This won’t do, Ol’ Nalaq. The peddlers that come around here rarely accept strange currency. Neighbor country’s money is usually fine but I don’t think these coins would do. I don’t even know which country these coins are from.”</p>\n<p>“Then use it to add your savings,” the spirit said. “And don’t call me Nalaq. Don’t push your primitive tribal nonsense to me. Call me ‘Good-Natured Spirit’ as usual. I’m not like your usual Nalaqs, brat.”</p>\n<p>“It’s not tribal.” The boy didn’t show any sign of agreement. He didn’t know why this roguish-grinning spirit didn’t like to be called a Nalaq. The way southern Mossack people, like the boy himself, addressed spirits were usually by two terms: Nalaq and Selaq. As far as he knew Nalaq was a title worth to be proud of.</p>\n<novel-trivia label=”Lore”>\n<p>Nalaq were those of the spirit of fallen heroes and mages, had attained high-level of enlightenment to see ways to preserve souls across death. Whilst no longer to be alive, Nalaqs own their consciousness and retain their memories as well intelligence, though part of their original power diminished, especially those who relied on physical might during their prime.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Selaqs arose from death through unnatural causes, sometimes fueled by resentment and great energy of negativity. Though more powerful, their spirit didn’t dissipate because of strong, usually vile, emotions their harbour when they died, the restless spirits stuck in the limbo and returned back to the mortal world as hostile, mindless haunting spectres.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>Theoretically the spirit that currently playing chess was a Nalaq. He still got his consciousness, true. But, in a way, his intelligence seemed way apart from the Nalaqs southern Mossack tribes often revered in the past--that was what the boy had in mind when looking at this vulgar grinning spirit.</p>\n<p>“You’re not thinking something stupid about me, are you?” the spirit said with a snort as he realized the unexcited eyes the boy had as if he was looking at cow dung.</p>\n<p>“No, I was thinking just the usual--I was wondering about your very existence and your real identity.”</p>\n<p>“That so?” the spirit raised his chin. “Don’t need overthinking it, boy. Hehe. If you know even a piece of my name then you’d be amazed by how amazing I am. Everybody is my bitch when I’m still your age back then, hehe. That’s true.”</p>\n<p>“Hooohhh…” the boy half-heartedly nodded. As expected, every time he brought the topic about the spirit’s identity, all he got was empty talks, disgusting enough for him to regret for bringing up the topic. For now, the only joyous thing he got to do was counting the money he won from the chess game as the bullshit Good-Natured Spirit sang about his past tuning endlessly in the background.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Somewhere in Tiramikal Continent, far in the opposite side of the cold, barbaric northern lands, not too isolated from the bustling early-capitalistic empires of the western lands, and not too far away from the neighbor eastern lands of never-ending warfares between the eastern Kaya feudal lords, a village known as Badril Village was living peaceful for a number of years. The old blood the locals knew as Badril Village’s three big families rooted deeply these past one hundred years in spite of the thinning southern Mossack heritage. Despite slowly developing their rural village worthy of the westerner tourists and easterners refugees, the southern locals still taking pride in their Mossack hunters and gatherers ancestry. Exactly one year ago Good-Natured Spirit appeared in this humble village.󠆞</p>\n<p>On the wall of Yashura Family’s courtyard, which was ridiculously thick and tall for ordinary villages, the spirit took out a rolled paper of dried tobacco. This might not be common knowledge known only to limited people; for converting earthly materials to spiritual goods for Nalaqs to use, it could only be done in an expensive and complicated manner--usually performed in rituals by the royalties and great ancient clans for annual offerings to their ancestors. But the spirit in shabby leather armor did the converting for cigarettes and other trivial goods. Nobody knew how he did it. Even if they did, it’d be very hard to judge whether his quirk was worth to be admired or to be ridiculed at. Nevertheless he got this kind of air around him that telling people he didn’t care much about what they think.</p>\n<p>The street below the wall were children below ages of ten playing with sticks and chasing each other. When a crowd of housewives came, his eyes, sharp as an eagle’s, sweeping through in search of prey. One of his habit that obviously he brought with him since he was alive was to oogle women, especially for young wives and pretty middle-aged aunties interesting big breasts and interesting big butts. Despite his sighing and occasional annoying tongue-clicking, though, those wives and children didn’t turn their heads toward him. They didn’t even know a lecher ghost was there haunting the street. A Nalaq couldn’t be seen by common folks by default. Unless he wanted to, no one would realize there was a suspicious spirit ogling for women that were passing by.</p>\n<p>There was a young woman he knew trotted the street. Good-Natured Spirit knew her. She was neither a wife nor she was an aunty. Her butt and breasts sizes were also not worth being fusing about. The name was Mila Yashura, seventeen years old since last month. She was the older cousin of the boy he lost playing chess to.</p>\n<p>“Aunty,” Mila greeted an aunty by lowering her head, “did you see my cousin Shira around here?”</p>\n<p>The local wife she asked shook her head. Mila Yashura said a polite thanks and continued searching for her cousin.</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit swept the street with his eyes, looking for something. When he saw a certain manservant he stopped. Using his spiritual knife, he dismantled a small pebble from the stone wall he sat on, flicked it using his thumb and knocked the manservant’s head with it.</p>\n<p>“Ouch!” the manservant cried.</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura abruptly turned her head and saw a manservant of her Yashura Family holding his head. She briskly coming to him and asked the same question she threw to the aunty before.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira?” the manservant glanced at the direction of the hill behind Yashura Family’s wall. “I saw him walking there at noon. But whether he has returned or not I don’t know.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you. That’s good enough. Here, treat yourself some coffee beans before the peddlers set for the next village.”</p>\n<p>The hill behind the Yashura Family’s dwelling was originally a place where the family members brought the family’s goats to graze its green grasses. But under the current patriarch’s management, the family’s fortunate mostly put on investing on coconut plantations, thus some grazing places were left unused.</p>\n<p>“Shira! So here’s you holing yourself. I’ve been searching you for nearly an hour,” Mila saw how her cousin who was two years younger than her enjoying himself lying under a shadowy tree, using his arms as pillows. She kicked his foot, yelling him to get up, but Shira merely changed his position and groaned in protest.</p>\n<p>“This buffon…” Mila hissed. “You know how the fact you’re lazing around everyday breeds all those crappy rumors, don’t you?”</p>\n<p>“People can talk whatever they want as long as they don’t bother me,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“But they bother our family!”</p>\n<p>Mila inhaling a deep breath. Now her voice getting higher annoyingly and she continued, “You’re the young master of our family, you lazy pig. The nearest in-line to inherit the patriarch title! You may don’t give a shit about your reputation now but if you are to take the leader's mantle from my father then all the crap they said would certainly bite your ass in the future! You hear?!”</p>\n<p>Shira picked his ear coolly. He might not know anything about the future, but certainly his cousin’s annoying nagging was biting his ass at this moment.</p>\n<p>“What are you doing alone in this kind of place anyway?”</p>\n<p>“You might not believe it, but I’m making a fortune here,” Shira said. Of course, whenever he played a game of chess with a spirit invisible to ordinary humans, he needed a quiet place where nobody was around. This was a perfect place for him.</p>\n<p>But Mila winced her eyes. A few seconds later, she turned her head, catching a canvas filled with rough sketches resting on the tree.</p>\n<p>“By painting?”</p>\n<p>“Sometimes that too.” Shira knew a bit about drawing scenery and people, so even with his limited interpersonal connection as an introvert he could make some money with his painting. However, his casual reply got Mila in a bad mood instead. Suddenly Shira remembered the embarrassing accident two months ago when Mila found an unfinished commision from a certain good-for-nothing spirit that he had carefully hidden in his house. When people commissioned a no-name painter they mostly asked for a portrait or image they deemed interesting. What kind of images Good-Natured Spirit found interesting? Women, of course. Especially those with big butts and big breasts. He liked them in thin, slipping clothings as if those vulnerable ladies were stuck in a very dangerous situation. In other words, erotic paintings.</p>\n<p>Then, sighing at the explosive nagging coming his way, Shira took a stick he slipped on his right ear and presented it as a bribe. Ancient southern Mossacks used berries and some used squid inks as pigments, but after waves of outside influence they started using quills and brushes, depending on the regions. Pencils, although practical, were introduced by a certain Nalaq spirit and Shira hadn’t heard anyone using it beside himself. The stick he used as a bribe was exactly a pencil. It sharpened many times and half-way on its way before he needed another one. Shira thought, maybe he should extort some more pencils for the next match from Good-Natured Spirit.</p>\n<p>Mila furrowed. She knew about the pencil and its value not too long ago thus, as expected, she grabbed it shamelessly. “What? Do you think you can escape only with this?”</p>\n<p>“I planned to give you something else but I think you’d rather like this simple bribe anyway.”</p>\n<p>Shira wanted to simply give her money to make her shut up. But the coins he had on him now only in form of foreign currency--the coins he extorted from Good-Natured Spirit from the last chess game. The boy frowned. Beside nagging him at full force, what did Mila coming here for?</p>\n<p>“Yeah, that reminds me, the news I wanted to tell you!” Mila finally snapped out of her nagging mode. “That Malikh girl! Your fiancée! After two years abroad! She’s finally coming home!”</p>\n<p>“Ohh…” the reply was anticlimactic.</p>\n<p>“Ohh? What the fuck with that reply?”</p>\n<p>“You don’t mind me. I just already burn out when people compare me with her,” Shira said. Although their age were the same, this young lady of Malikh Family was famous even in the nearby villages and town as a talent, with a promising look that might make her a beauty worth dying for. The old generations called her treasure and the boys loved her as the village princess. She went abroad two years ago for a series of seminars after an official from the capital scouted her talent. Now that she returned, everybody was fervently talking about her. But for Shira Yashura, the boy who was supposed to be the fiancé, even that kind of news wasn’t enough to make him get up from his comfortable napping.</p>\n<p>“My father wants to talk with you,” Mila said, “get up now.”</p>\n<p>“What about?”</p>\n<p>“You still asking?”</p>\n<p>The boy had a premonition that a troublesome matter would be waiting for him. Mila gave him an ultimatum before she wandered off to do her own things.</p>\n<p>“Hehe, what’s this fiancée I heard just now?” Good-Natured Spirit popped out his head from a tree beside Shira.</p>\n<p>“It’s not what you think,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“Oh yeah?” Good-Natured Spirit nudged the boy with his elbow. “I heard that chick is a hella beauty. Hehe, I bet her luggages is in good-quality, you know what I mean?”</p>\n<p>“From whom did you hear that?”</p>\n<p>“Doesn’t matter who. When it comes to chick my radar is very sensitive, eh. I’m curious. Did you benefit from this engagement thingy? Benefit, know what I mean?”</p>\n<p>Shira clicked his tongue. “Like I said, it’s not what you think it is. Our parents set us up and it’s been a mess since the talks about engagement got out.”</p>\n<p>Talking some sense to this good-for-nothing Nalaq was futile. Good-Natured Spirit kept teasing him. “You haven’t seen her for two years, have you? The talks I’ve been hearing down there real hairy, brat. I mean… especially those luggages of hers, know what I mean? Know what I mean? Nudge nudge. Nudge nudge,” he winked. “Wanna check on her?”</p>\n<p>“I need to go back. My uncle wants to talk with me.”</p>\n<p>“Alright then,” Good-Natured Spirit nodded as he rubbed his chin. “I’ll check the chick myself.”</p>\n<p>Carrying the canvas and the chess with him, Shira warned the Nalaq, “You better not do anything funny to her, hear me?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho. Jealous?”</p>\n<p>“I just don’t want their entire family coming right after me with pitchforks just because yo do something stupid.”</p>\n<p>After he said that Shira Yashura turned around. He started to walk down the hill. Good-Natured Spirit saw the boy walk without caring for the world, then he set off to check the girl by himself with a chuckle that escaped from his mouth.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A few hours later the said fiancée showed herself in a public training field. The field, owned by the most influential family in Badril Village--the Elzhier Family--was neatly arranged with archery targets and provided with dulled swords for the teenagers trained themselves or doing mock battles. The Elzhiers sent some menservants occasionally to act as security in case conflicts would occur. Today, the young master of the said family himself, nicknamed Bony, guarded the entrance along with two of his lackeys.</p>\n<p>“I’ve got to pay you to enter?!” a young man gawked at the sudden irregularity regarding the training field’s rules. “What’s this? The field is supposed to be free for everyone!”</p>\n<p>“Well, man, gotta pay for maintenance cost,” one of the lackeys, called Pilek, said as he rubbed his nose.</p>\n<p>“One silver kobe! Heh, maintenance cost my ass! Nobody would pay for this bullshit.”</p>\n<p>“Nobody? You wrong, man,” another lackey called Polio pointed at the crowd inside the training field with a gesture of his head. The girl from the Malikh Family causing a big ruckus from her arrival alone. She attracted boys like a bright lamp attracted fireflies. Because of that, the three deliquents in the entrance for nearly half an hour had been amassing quite a fortune till now.</p>\n<p>“I’ll definitely send complaints to Elzhier Family now. Just because your father is the village head you think you can do whatever you want, eh?” the young man snorted, sending a glare to them.</p>\n<p>The Elzhier Family’s young master, who had been watching with his back resting on the wall and his arms crossed, decided to open his mouth, he said, “Pay or get lost.”</p>\n<p>“Hear that? Boss Bony has spoken,” Pilek glared back at the young man with his head tilted. “Better get lost now or else…”</p>\n<p>“Or else!” Polio emphasized with a higher voice.</p>\n<p>The three of them had been infamous in the village despite being heirs to their respective families. Naturally, though they were the same age, only an idiot would butting head directly with the heir of Elzhier Family. Thus the young man snorted, unwillingly turned and walked away.</p>\n<p>“What the heck is that?” Pilek didn’t like the way that young man snorted at them. “We should teach bastards like him a few good lessons one of these days.”</p>\n<p>“You’re right,” Polio added.</p>\n<p>“Just ignore that bum,” Bony said.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, the next onlookers came. Not boys, but two girls to be exact. They carried bags of dirty clothes with them as they were on their way to wash the clothes at the river.</p>\n<p>“Well, I’d be damned,” one of the girls, a young lady named Romana, said, “I’ve been hearing about the rumors but looking at that Malikh girl, damn…. Look at how she did with her hair, Mila.”</p>\n<p>They could see what was happening in the field even from the entrance. The two girls looked at a certain girl who was surrounded by boys. The other girl, Mila Yashura, furrowed her brows at the current appearance of her cousin’s fiancée. She kept her mouth shut despite the anger on her eyes.</p>\n<p>“She cut her hair short despite being engaged to your cousin,” Romana said to Mila. “What’s that supposed to mean?”</p>\n<p>It was a custom of southern Mossack people for women to cut their hair short to tell the opposite sex they currently unavailable. Mostly widows who weren’t ready to be courted again chose to cut their hair that way. However, since the young lady of Malikh Family was currently engaged, the act of cutting her hair short was confusing to people.</p>\n<p>From the three delinquents who had been hearing their conversations, Pilek butted in, “Yo, ladies, don’t think too much about it. We southern people been foreigners with this fiancé-and-fiancée business. We practical people, y’know? Southerners the kind of people who would do it first then talking ‘bout marriage later. A chance she might not know what she was doing.”</p>\n<p>Romana rolled her eyes. Knowing Mila Yashura was here, she wished this stupid cheerful delinquent wouldn’t say what he had said. In fact, better for him to not open his mouth. She hated him whenever he opened his mouth and said pointless things.</p>\n<p>Her and Mila’s goal was to check about the rumor regarding the fiancée’s short hair. They didn’t have the intention to enter the training field and mingle with those crowdy horny boys, lest talking with these shameless thugs who clearly act as bandits.</p>\n<p>“Let’s go, Mila,” Romana whispered as she realized Mila had been glaring at the three delinquents. Moving her eyes from Mila, she looked at Bony who was in between his two lackeys. She whispered again, “you can’t fight him like you used to. He got a Knight class now. People said he can even fight another Knight with four level above him. Let’s just forget about it.”</p>\n<p>Last time Mila and Bony fought was three years ago. Her punch made his nose bleed but that was the end of it. It was a hot topic for a while and most didn’t know what happened but the long enmity between the two of them suddenly dropped cold and they had been avoiding each other. Seeing how the other party was quite well, Mila Yashura grimaced. They were Novices back then but now, after both of them ascended the first level barrier and got themselves class titles, there was no way a support-class Specialist like her could deliver that kind of punch again to his face.</p>\n<p>“Mm. Let’s go,” Mila said to Romana. No matter how brave and reckless she was, as a non-combatant talent, she knew better than to sow another discord with the village’s young generation’s strongest.</p>\n<p>Pilek, the most cheerful in Bony’s group, who was actually the most friendly, waved his hand to the girls as they walked away. Neither of them bothered with him.</p>\n<p>“Ahhh, my sister’s been avoiding me lately,” Pilek grumbled. Romana, Mila’s friend, was actually his half-sister from different mother. He was a proud big brother when they were young, until their mothers had a fight and his half-sister moved into a separate house.</p>\n<p>“Pilek,” Bony called.</p>\n<p>“Yes boss?”</p>\n<p>“You should’ve kept your mouth shut.”</p>\n<p>Pilek wryly smiled and nodded. Polio also thought his friend Pilek couldn’t read between the line. Although Pilek’s remark was well-intentioned, it’d just make things worse for Bony. The bad mood from back three years ago still left after taste that made him and her uncomfortable dealing with each other.</p>\n<p>After that, more people were coming to see the young lady of Malikh Family.</p>\n<p>The talks and speculations about her hair made the boys think she was dissatisfied with her engagement with Shira Yashura. Thus giving them hopes to snatch her away. It was no exaggeration to say that most of the boys fell for her, especially after they saw how the young lady grew beautifully. They surrounded this girl who had this icy expression on her face, though she herself greatly concentrated on holding a bow and an arrow, eyes straight to the archery target dozens of meters from her. She shot. And when the arrow hit splendidly, the boys would cheer and fawn all over her. The girl kept her face cold despite the flooding flattery coming at her way.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” a young man in his early twenty stepped forward from the bunch of admirers and confidently said, “I see you have this different aura about you. Something special that I can’t quite get my fingers on it, and I can’t help but feel curious about you.”</p>\n<p>That was supposed to be a pick-up line, but Bhela Malikh replied straightforwardly, “I changed. Now I’m Level 10 and not a Novice anymore.”</p>\n<p>“Oooohhhh!!” the crowd was surprised. Reaching the first barrier and got a class title at fifteen years old was the second time in these two decades. The first one was Bony. However, considering the girl was quite a talent enough for people in the capital to notice her, there was a high chance for her to snatch the crown as Badril Village’s young generation’s strongest from Bony sooner than everyone expected.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” the young man called for her attention again, despite his first attempt at hitting on her was an utter failure. “I see your beautiful sharp eyes and beautiful nimble hands and your beautiful pretty face. The class you’ve got must be… a beautiful <b>Archer</b>, right?”</p>\n<p>“I am an archer,” Bhela replied tight-lipped. Well, it was obvious when she picked a bow the first thing she arrived here.</p>\n<p>“Ah, a beautiful and talented Archer then! It’s a pity, though for such a fine beautiful flower like yourself to be thrown into a heap of cow dung…”</p>\n<p>The remark made Bhela Malikh raise her brows. She somehow could predict where the topic was going to be directed.</p>\n<p>“That stupid engagement is what I say! How could a diamond such as yourself be forced to marry a trash from Yashura Family?”</p>\n<p>He sighed like he pitied the harsh fate of the beauty. And though unlikeable as he was, the murmurs of the crowd seemingly agreed with him. At that point, someone said, “That’s true. Even my ten years old nephew is one Level above him. Such trash to become…”</p>\n<p>The words stopped, Bhela looked at the person who said that. “The one from Yashura Family--he’s still a Level 3 Novice?”</p>\n<p>It was someone else who replied to her question. “Ah, yes, he’s stuck and made no progress even since Young Lady Bhela went outside the village. Everyone calls him The Eternal Novice.”</p>\n<p>And this made her raised brows turned into a frown. Going by the crowd, for a Level 5 Novice by fifteen years old was already considered slow progress even by the standard of rural places like Badril Village. Mostly at that age the youngsters already reached Level 7, the diligent ones could reach Level 8 with hard work. Faster than that, not counting usage of an unreasonable amount of growth-hack potions--which most children from rich noble families did, could be considered a talent amongst the younger generation. However, to think of a boy one year before his own coming-of-age ceremony coming still stuck at such low-level talent, even though if he was the heir of Badril Village’s major families, people would still call him trash, even in public.</p>\n<p>“Ah, Young Lady Bhela! You don’t have to bother yourself with such eyesore trash. I know you’re troubled with the careless arrangement your father made, but if we put our mind to it, we can--”</p>\n<p>All was well until the young man put bad words about her father. Never did he expect that the girl would mercilessly retract her hand just before the tips of their fingers touched.</p>\n<p>“Please don’t pretend you were familiar with me,” that was what she said.</p>\n<p>The rain of snickers rang all around him. Despite him glaring left and right in an intimidating manner, there was no way for him to suppress the crowd from humiliating him further. At the time he realized the chance for him to court the Young Lady of Malikh Family, the sole daughter of the Malikh Family Patriarch, was pitifully close to nothing. Thus, in a moment of spontaneity, he thought of a scheme to save his face and sounded it with a flash of desperate smirk plastered on his face. He grabbed a bow and said, “I see Young Lady Bhela rather reserved toward us long friends after two years abroad. Hmm, yeah, this is a perfect chance, by the way. I’m an Archer too, see. So why not this senior teach you a thing or two? Seventy meters--perhaps a good learning experience for young lady, no?”</p>\n<p>The surrounding began chattering lively. It was obvious it was a challenge as Archers. And the young man’s smirk turned more and more confident at the girl’s unresponsiveness. No matter how much potential talent one had, time and experience playing a vital role in assessing one’s current performance whether she was Archer or Priest or Knight or other classes. Skills, abilities one acquired after reaching the first barrier and getting a new class title could only progress with constant tempering in battle and improved alongside one’s level. The young man was a Level 12 Archer. So theoretically, a Level 10 new Archer like Bhela Malikh would need a few more years before she could beat the opponent in a fair competition.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh was annoyed. She glared at the ones who were supposed to be guarding the field. But Bony and his lackeys were busy counting coins. For Bhela, the crowd were a bunch of stupid annoying busybodies who prevented her to train in peace. But for Bony and his lackeys the crowd was simply a bunch of gold mines.</p>\n<p>“Please watch closely how I do it, Young Lady Bhela. See my elbow? If you could do the same way I do it, I’m sure your archery skill would improve significantly.”</p>\n<p>No one really bothered with the ‘humble direction’ the young man spouted. Bhela didn’t spare him a glance. She looked straight to target seventy meters from where she was standing. Repressing his anger, the young man began to shoot three arrows one by one splendidly; the final one landed right in the center of the target that was marked in red dot.</p>\n<p>He was satisfied with the result. Glancing at the young lady, this young man wanted to utter more words to improve his image. However, right before he opened his mouth, he found Bhela already drew her arrow, released it, and it hit one arrow splendidly. Not just hitting the target, but an arrow the young man previously shot. The second was the same. And the final third arrow also hit the arrow on the red dot.</p>\n<p>What was that? She used a skill? The young man wanted to object but his tongue froze and his lips quivered. Did she use <b>Far Sight</b> skill that enhanced eye-sight a hundred of meters away? Did she use <b>Boost Accuracy</b>, the skill that was supposedly forbidden to be used in duel between Archers? To think of beating him, an Archer older than her and 2 Level right above her, in such a devastating manner… she must be cheating, right?</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” the defeated young man said weakly, “I didn’t use my mana between my shots.”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh nodded.</p>\n<p>“Neither was I.”</p>\n<p>With that, Bhela turned around and left the crowd of dumbfounded boys with steps full of grace. She approached the entrance, returned back the bow she used to the three delinquents who just let people mess with her training and said coldly, “If this is how the famous Young Master Elzhier manages his property, then there’s no need for me to come here again. Please excuse me.”</p>\n<p>Bony’s expression didn’t change much as he still crossed his arms and rested his back casually on the wall.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Pilek, the one received the returned bow from Bhela, waved his hand again and shouted, “Take care, princess!”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Because she couldn’t train her archery peacefully in public, Bhela returned back to Malikh Family and trained in her private training place.</p>\n<p>It was originally a backyard turned archery ground, made by Malikh Family Patriarch after knowing his daughter showed interest in archery. It was nothing fancy. It was spacious and good enough when she started with her first bow but now Bhela felt the place was lacking. At most, she had to live with the meager fifty meters range maximum. Therefore, the practice she had made a habit of had to wait.</p>\n<p>Therefore, Bhela Malikh decided to put her mind over something else than her usual practice instead.</p>\n<p>She drew a deep breath. A table was provided with dozens of arrows laid on top of it. Bhela picked four at the same time, nocked them on her bow string. She began to aim.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the air surrounding her changed. Her inexperience as a newly Novice-graduate showed by the obvious mana that leaked from the inside out. With naked eyes, her mana looked calm colorful haze that consisted of four bold colors, tangling and struggling with each other for dominance. Her eyelashes quivered. Channeling mana to cast a skill she yet had mastered felt like trying to stand on the raging sea waves while she herself was being a weak newborn.</p>\n<p><em>Whhhhuuuuushh--</em></p>\n<p><em>Shuuuhsh--</em></p>\n<p><em>Ssshhhuuuush--</em></p>\n<p><em>Wwhuuuussh!!</em></p>\n<p>The fastest arrow, coated with sparking yellow-colored mana, hit one of the targets at around forty meters range. But the others performed pitifully. The one infused with wet blue-colored mana didn’t even reach two-third of the desired range. The green-colored one, an arrow infused with mana that generated unstable wind trajectory flew far far away, as if it was getting swallowed by the sky, never to be seen again. The last one, the red-colored arrow, was horrifying. It hit the training ground fence instead the target. The bamboo fences suddenly set ablaze by raging flames as soon as the said arrow came into contact with them.</p>\n<p><em>Clap clap clap!</em></p>\n<p>Uninvited claps resounded across the training ground. On the wall Good-Natured Spirit clapping after watching a good spectacle. For getting hand claps from a Nalaq like him, naturally the level of talent Bhela showed just now was far beyond ordinary.</p>\n<p>“Thank you…” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>It appeared she knew beforehand the four-arrows skill she shot would make a mess. So she gathered the maidservants and made them extinguish the fences that started to burn into ashes. “Thank you, thank you for your hard work,” she said to a pair of maidservants who briskly went back and forth to kill the fire before its spread.</p>\n<p>“Ah! Young lady, what skill was that just now?” one of the maidservants gawked after the fire was extinguished.</p>\n<p>“That wasn’t just your ordinary Archer skill, was it?” added the other.</p>\n<p>Summoning a blazing fire just with an arrow and pure mana was unheard of. At least, the maidservants knew nobody in the village could do that.</p>\n<p>Bhela drank a glass of murky liquify herbs mixed with mint to cool down her manasphere. “It’s something I learned when I was away,” she said after putting down the glass on the tray her maid servants provided. She continued, “I still can’t master it, though.”</p>\n<p>She cast her eyes at the unharmed targets one by one. Shooting at forty meters range was still too much for her using four arrows at the same time. When the maidservants realized her difficulty, they encouraged her to simplify it and shoot one arrow at a time. However at their suggestion, Bhela shook her head. “It’s the requirement of this skill I’ve got to shoot four arrows,” she explained.</p>\n<p>The maidservants nodded at her words and apologized for their shallow suggestion.</p>\n<p>“Don’t mind that,” Bhela waved her hand. “There’s something I heard from people, by the way. Something about Young Master Yashura.”</p>\n<p>The two maidservants glanced at each other before one of them replied. “The rumor says… he holed up from the public’s view because he’s ashamed he can’t even become a Level 4 Novice.”</p>\n<p>“Are the Yashura Family elders still favoring him as the heir of Yashura Family Patriarch?”</p>\n<p>“We don’t know whether they still favor him or not. But Yashura Family always united in their standing. So unless the current Patriarch of Yashura Family has a son, the Young Master Shira Yashura will undoubtedly become the next patriarch.”</p>\n<p>“No rumors about the Yashura Family elders wavering then?”</p>\n<p>The maidservants shook their heads altogether.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela… apologize for giving you my shallow suggestion once again but…” one of the maidservants came near to Bhela and whispered, “With him as the heir, Yashura Family’s future will be bleak. Everyone in our family said your father’s bad condition is a bad omen for us mingling with those simple Yashuras. I’m very sorry if this sounds impudent--but you should’ve better cut ties with them before too late, young lady. Madam was too grieved by your father’s ill health to make decisions thus the only one who can save our Malikh Family is you.”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at the maidservant. The glint on her eyes changed.</p>\n<p>“There’s already a plan laid to help our Malikh Family,” that was all Bhela said. “You better not say something like that again. You lucky no one here beside me to hear you utter that kind of words.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you for your mercy, young lady! We are sorry for being impudent!”</p>\n<p>They decided to make it history with only the four of them who knew the previous conversation. The four of them; the young lady and two maid servants and one Nalaq spirit who came here uninvited.</p>\n<p>“It seems I just heard something I shouldn’t hear,” Good-Natured Spirit said while he rubbed his chin. He came here peeking. He didn’t have the intention to reveal himself while the girls below had a secret conversation ignorant of his presence.</p>\n<p>After that Bhela continued with light training. Good-Natured Spirit watched her doing simple shooting, she didn’t even use a slightest of her mana from then on. Yawning, Good-Natured Spirit stood up. Then he flew away from Malikh Family and began to look for some other interesting thing to sate his boredom.</p>\n<hr>\n<authors-note id=\"Radhy\">\n<p>Testing, testing.

Upon reporting back to the head maid for her old post, she was told that there was a new girl who already filled it--and for her to continue to work in Blackwood Family, there was no other way except for coming to work as the Blackwood Family’s young lady’s private attendant.</p>\n<p>Being an attendant of someone from the main bloodline from a mere common maidservant was a promotion--normally. It was different when it came to the Young Lady of Blackwood Family. Just when Jane thought she had just received bad luck due to her unfaithful partner, another worse luck hit her hard.</p>\n<p>“Head maid! Please, anything but there!” she promptly cling on the head maid’s legs. “Don’t send me to Young Lady’s place, please so something for me to get my old post back, we’re sisters for years, head maid! Please, do me a favor--just this once!”</p>\n<p>“Jane, don’t be foolish, the new girl is Butler Tim’s niece. They’ve been waiting for a post to be empty to slip her in the past two months. Do you think I could get it back that easily?”</p>\n<p>“H-head maid…” Jane knew, although Butler Tim didn’t have enough influence to be a tyrant in Blackwood Family’s manor, still not someone Jane could afford to offend. Biting her bottom lip, she whispered, “Please, head maid… if I perished due to bad luck, how could my family pay their debts?”</p>\n<p>“Get up now. Didn’t you say you have a way to pay it without working here for a dozen years more?”</p>\n<p>“That was before,” Jane’s voice was hoarse, “I never would’ve thought that bastard only spout empty promises of taking care of my family and other bullshit. Maybe it’s my lucky star that the bastard didn’t manage to make me pregnant after all this time!”</p>\n<p>“Now you know better than rely your future on nauseating romance, so I’m going to tell you, Jane--second chances are hard to get, you need to grasp it if one appears in front of you.”</p>\n<p>“But wouldn’t it be my last chance I’m to serve Young Lady Blackwood? Everybody’s ended up dead after they were sent to Young Lady’s place!”</p>\n<p>“Nonsense. Emeralda and Jenny are still alive and well these past six months there.”</p>\n<p>“Their death is only a matter of time!”</p>\n<p>Head maid sighed.</p>\n<p>“Jane oh Jane, I’m sending you not because I want to see your demise. You’re hardworking girl albeit annoying, how come I want you to die?”</p>\n<p>Jane already feeling numb being called names by this woman ten years her senior. Though in her heart she cursed head maid with nicknames like old virgin or such, she still desperate enough for tears falling down her cheeks. “Head maid, what do you mean by that?”</p>\n<p>“Don’t you know Sir Arden Blackwood had inquired about young lady’s place a few times recently?” head maid asked her with enigmatic smile.</p>\n<p>Jane blinked. She immediately came to head maid as soon as she knew her old post being taken and didn’t have time to gossip with other maidservants. “Really, head maid, you know I just came back. Don’t talk in a roundabout way…”</p>\n<p>“Sir Arden is going to hire an expert to clear plague in our Young Lady’s mansion, he’s planning to do it in a month's time,” the head maid said. “You know Sir Arden’s reputation, and you know how reliable his words are. Go serve Young Lady there--by the time Sir Arden comes with the hired expert, he’ll be grateful for loyal servants who willing to accompany his niece in her difficult time!”</p>\n<p>Hearing the urge behind head maid’s tone, Jane choked by her own cry from earlier. Even Madam Blackwood had to be polite to this younger brother of hers--as the man’s reputation was the sole reason Madam could be so tyrannical on ruling the house. But even then Sir Arden was too lazy to pay attention to his sister and her be. Jane, a mere maidservant--could she really gain Sir Arden Blackwood’s favor?</p>\n<p>The head maid continued, “What are you hesitating for? Even Floria that girl who even prettier than you couldn’t even get Sir Arden to glance at her--do you think any girl can have the same chance as yours right now?” she paused, learning the contour of Jane’s expression before she said again, “even if you can’t be his mistress, Jane, I assure you that even Butler Tim won’t be able to touch your position if Sir Arden Blackwood has a good impression on you.”</p>\n<p>Jane lowered her head. Head maid was right. A chance to get on Sir Arden Blackwood’s good side wouldn’t come as easily as this.</p>\n<p>She calculated the weight and found that, since two of her friends were sent to serve Young Lady Blackwood six month ago and still survive, a good odd that Sir Arden Blackwood would rescue her before the disease from Young Lady’s cursed bad luck would take her life for good.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>There was no need for her to prepare anything. Her luggage was ready since she didn’t get to visit her old dorm. The head maid even was generous to give Jean a gift money from her own pocket, making Jean feel less regret about how things turned out.</p>\n<p>To get into the young lady’s personal mansion, Jane already followed a quiet middle-aged steward with an old carriage pulled by an old mare, which had an appearance that was nothing fancy since the steward’s job all these past two years were only replenishing goods and food supplies. The mansion was originally the noble family’s vacation site, so the distance between the main mansion wasn’t trivial. It required almost the whole day to get there with the quiet steward’s creaky old carriage.</p>\n<p>When they about to arrive at the old mansion that hosted the Blackwood Family’s young lady, the quiet steward spoke, “The conditions of your colleagues aren’t good. We still haven’t yet sure of the epidemic’s epicenter, but we know there’s something wrong with nearby plants or water sources from the well in backyard of that mansion, so it’s best if you follow what the senior servant’s words from here forward.”</p>\n<p>Jane curled her lips sourly. This steward talked as if he was sincerely giving advice, yet for those in the main manor who didn’t know the rumors about their young lady? The thought spread amongst the servants since for these past three years the young lady was the sole survivor despite many of the servants being wiped out just by staying beside her in a month’s time.</p>\n<p>Arriving at the destination welcoming them were a pair of pale-faced maidservants waiting at the gate. Both were somehow familiar. A moment later, Jane was stupefied when she found out that the two white doll-like girls with black eyebags on them were actually Emeralda and Jenny she had known back since her first year being a maidservant. No longer Jane could see two noise sisters of hers who always skipped work to gossip, only two sets of dead eyes left, seeing her but not with greeting eyes, almost like strangers.</p>\n<p>“Welcome,” Emeralda greeted with a flat tone.</p>\n<p>“Welcome,” the other girl repeated. No enthusiasm could be hear within their voices, as if they were greeting a stranger before them.</p>\n<p>Jane didn’t expect this. Six months of serving in this damned mansion indeed could change gossip friends into strangers. Even when she tried to strike a conversation what replied her were business-like formal speech. In the end, the only thing Jane could do was pretend to be busy helping the quiet steward unload the carriage.</p>\n<p>Both Jenny and Emeralda probably were chosen to welcome her because their familiarity with each other. At least, when they noticed her was there. There were one other maidservant and one old nanny beside them, whom, when Jane tried to greet them, didn’t even bat an eye and continued to be busy sweeping a clean place instead.</p>\n<p>“Listen, you,” the quiet steward approached Jane after he done unloading supplies and about to return back to the city, “I will come back one week after this to replenish the kitchen. If you’ve got any questions, ask them directly to the old nanny who’s taking care of the young lady. Other maidservants are occupied. It’s best for you not to disturb them when they are busy.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” Jane replied, said nothing else. There was nothing she could say anyway, especially when she saw the usually lazy friends of hers became strangers and suspiciously diligent instead--they were so diligent that they spent the afternoon circling the yard looking for hidden dry leaves to sweep.</p>\n","volume-3/chapter-10-7":"<p><em>From the tender age of six, the Young Lady of Blackwood Family had lived alongside a deadly pandemic.</em></p>\n<p><em>For she is cursed.</em></p>\n<p><em>And to serve beside her means Blackwood Family has abandoned you.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>There was a particular maidservant in Blackwood Family named Jane who had just returned because the marriage she almost had was canceled due to her fiancé’s adultery. Upon reporting back to the head maid for her old post, she was told that there was a new girl who already filled it--and for her to continue to work in Blackwood Family, there was no other way except for coming to work as the Blackwood Family’s young lady’s private attendant.</p>\n<p>Being an attendant of someone from the main bloodline from a mere common maidservant was a promotion--normally. It was different when it came to the Young Lady of Blackwood Family. Just when Jane thought she had just received bad luck due to her unfaithful partner, another worse luck hit her hard.</p>\n<p>“Head maid! Please, anything but there!” she promptly cling on the head maid’s legs. “Don’t send me to Young Lady’s place, please so something for me to get my old post back, we’re sisters for years, head maid!

Even though the expensive Ngajen Ceremony drew near a good number of ducks and a goat were butchered along with their spice reserves taken out. There were laughters, there lots of people wanted to get on the good side of the only Young Lady of Malikh Family.</p>\n<p>But Bhela’s face was straight the whole time. Given choices, she’d rather have a small dinner with her mother and sick father right now.</p>\n<p>“I heard you went to Elzhier’s training facility as soon as you arrived, young lady,” a bald elder said with big smile. “That is no good. You just return home after four days of traveling. You must have a good rest first.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you for your concern, Elder Jhamil.”</p>\n<p>Bhela had experience with people during her two years abroad to know the meaning of smiles like Elder Jhamil’s--the kind of smile that didn’t reach eyes, the fake kind of smile. She always found it was uncomfortable whenever she met with one. Yet what was more uncomfortable was the fact she was the star of the party. Flatteries and congratulations flowing in. Bhela kept nodding her head and had a smiling expression on her face. No one really had a good time beside the ignorant families who came to find abundant foods to eat.</p>\n<p>Finally toward the end of the big dinner Elder Jhamil gave a few speeches and led everyone for their patriarch's health. Bhela hadn’t come home for two years, but she was alert enough to know the popular opinion going around inside the Malikh Family. She knew her father was disliked by many because the engagement he set up more than a dozen years ago, back when she wasn’t even able to speak yet, back when the Malikhs didn’t think much of it and didn’t know the girl back then would grow splendidly into a fair Young Lady. What she didn’t expect was that, Elder Jhamil, would point it out in front of other family members.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady, I’m sure you’re aware about it by now, but the one from Yashura Family is still stuck on the same level from back when you were leaving for your seminars.”</p>\n<p>“I’m aware, yes,” she said. “And?”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil smiled dryly at the question, he said, “With a partner that lazy he’d drag you sooner or later, wouldn’t he? Especially with special talent as yours, many would have second thoughts. But then how about you? Are you fine with that, Young Lady?”</p>\n<p>Bhela didn’t immediately say what was on her mind. She quietly picked the warm ginger drink they served her, drank it, while her eyes glanced at a certain direction where two maidservants who immediately glanced down the moment her eyes came into contact with theirs.</p>\n<p>Seeing that Bhela wasn’t that responsive with the idea, Elder Jhamil spoke further, “Young Lady, don’t worry, we as Malikhs only worried about your future. If you feel injustice in your heart, you must be brave, you must voice it out to your parents, Young Lady Bhela--all of us Malikhs support you for whichever path you choose! Isn’t that right, everyone?”</p>\n<p>“That’s right!” someone shouted. Then came more rougher voice--</p>\n<p>“We don’t fear those Yashura’s retaliation, Young Lady. You don’t have to be afraid they’ll come here to bully us because of that trash from Yashura Family!”</p>\n<p>“We support you, Young Lady!”</p>\n<p>“Don’t be afraid!”</p>\n<p>The dry smile on Elder Jhamil turned elated when people were chanting along with his cue. It was only when Bhela slowly put down the warm glass of ginger drink in her hand did they stop making ruckus, everyone was waiting for what Bhela was going to say next.</p>\n<p>“I think,” Bhela said with the remarkable cold expression of hers, “any engagement in the main family should be the main family’s business only.”</p>\n<p>She stopped. Not a single more soul dared to send her further flatteries until dinner was over. Even the bald Elder Jhamil, the most enthusiastic of all them, quietly sat back where he belonged.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>“Ah, young lady, please wait, Young Lady Bhela!” the bald Elder Jhamil chased her, trotting, with a box in his hands.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh frowned upon hearing the voice. But she hid her expression well as turned around and asked, “Is something the matter, Elder Jhamil?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, in fact, there’s one matter a bit inappropriate to deal in the family hall,” as soon as Elder Jhamil said that, he opened the box he carried. It was a dress. “It’s something that I get from a merchant who has a lot of dealing with people in the west. He told me this is apparently the current popular fashion for western nobles. I think it’s good for Young Lady.”</p>\n<p>Bhela studied Elder Jhamil’s expression. If the dress truly was a fashionable goods then the elder ought to have paid a quite of coins to get this. As far as Bhela Malikh remembered, Elder Jhamil she knew wasn’t this kind even when her father the patriarch married. Naturally with such an expensive homecoming gift, Bhela was alerted.</p>\n<p>“Thank you for your kindness, Elder Jhamil. Bhela will treasure this well.”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, you don’t have to mention it, Young Lady Bhela,” Elder Jhamil said with a laugh. Then, while rubbing his palms unconsciously, the bald elder began to smile--not a fake one like he usually did have, a genuine smile, one that reflected his current emotion--the smile of greed. “By the way, young lady,” he continued, “I heard you getting along well with the Young Master from the noble Blackwood Family during your time away…”</p>\n<p>“Young Lady of Blackwood Family is my friend,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“Yeah but… I also heard in the next ngajen ceremony, Young Master Blackwood would grace us with his presence… is that true?”</p>\n<p>“I wouldn’t know.”</p>\n<p>“Hehe,” Elder Jhamil chuckled knowingly. “I think things would go well if you wear that dress during ngajen ceremony, young lady.”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh said a short and ambiguous reply and tried to get away from the bald elder. After she escaped in the lone corridor, she took out the dress from the box. The said dress was glimmering under the torchlight, yet, in spite of that, Bhela wasn’t happy the slightest bit.</p>\n<p>“This kind of thing…”</p>\n<p>A proper dress for ladies of southern people was hiding everything below the collarbone. Showing more, akin to invite men to do something indecent. Bhela wasn’t a conservative to follow Mossack customes down rigidly as shown from her cutting her hair short despite the gesture usually reserved for unavailable widows. But still, something like decency of girlhood, was something even someone duller than Bhela should have. Even daring courtesans would think twice to wear this kind of provocative dress to attend a festivity made by the Mossack majority.</p>\n<p>It was distasteful. Bhela didn’t want to think too much about it. After putting back the dress, Bhela walked again to the east wing of Malikh Family where her father was resting.</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim Malikh’s sick room once used as the family’s <b>Alchemist</b> workplace. It had long been vacant, thus usually used to care sick and injured people, as it had the most complete medicinal facility in the entire Malikh Family. Upon entering the room, Bhela found the thick pungent of herbs made her head light. And still she was amazed by how loyal her mother was to taking care of her father closely when servants would need to take a breather of fresh air ten minutes inside the sick room.</p>\n<p>“Father, mother, I’m back…. Did they send some food here?”</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh, the mother, was the one who replied to Bhela. “They did. Some people might forget about the patriarch’s little family but there are still good aunties working in the kitchen,” a middle-aged woman said with a hint of sadness, helplessness, and resentment.</p>\n<p>“Does mother want some hot tea? I’ll go fetch and say my thanks for those good aunties,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“You girl, sit down. You just returned today, now you want to run around doing errands?” Madam Malikh smiled weakly. “How’s the village, dear? Does it change from the way you remembered?”</p>\n<p>“Somes changed, others stay the same, mother,” Bhela said. She got to the table and put the box Elder Jhamil gifted, then took it off her mind. She then picked a random book from the shelves. “Can I stay here for a while?” she asked while showing the book to her mother, telling her the intention that she was going to read it there.</p>\n<p>The mother’s smile turned strained. At noon, she purposely told this daughter of hers to see around the village because she was afraid, if Bhela spent too much time in this room, she would feel uncomfortable by the thick medicinal smell and grow to hate the idea of staying. Even some maidservants a few years older than her were fidgeting and eyeing for the door every time they had duty to bring a meal here. Yet, looking from her daughter’s unflinching eyes, Madam Malikh was relented in the end.</p>\n<p>“Sit here,” the mother offered her chair for her daughter, while she sat down on the edge of her husband’s bed.</p>\n<p>Bhela’s moved with small, noiseless steps, trying not to wake up her father. But it was unfortunate that her father woke up nonetheless.</p>\n<p>“Le… letter…”</p>\n<p>The quivering voice escaped his cracking dry lips.</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh wanted to retort. Not the letter again. No matter how many times she read it aloud he still thirst for the letter as if it was the only salvation left for his life. Nonetheless, she surrendered and she picked a smooth, white paper made from wood--the kind which was expensive and usually used overseas--and began to read its content.</p>\n<p>“I understand your situation. But sending help from where I am takes a while. Ask Yulong’s help for now.”</p>\n<p>As if the letter was his assurance, Patriarch Ghalim Malikh closed his eyes again.</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at her mother who folded the recently opened letter, she asked. “Whose letter is that?”</p>\n<p>“Your great-grandmother who lived overseas,” her mother said.</p>\n<p>“I see.” Bhela wasn’t sure which relative her mother mentioned, but she decided to ask something else seeing her mother’s bad mood. “Why Great-grandmother mentioned something about Yulong? Isn’t Yulong the Yashura Family’s butler, mother?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know, I reckon she told us to rely on Yashura Family instead.”</p>\n<p>The strained smile on her mother’s face made Bhela realize that even her mother was reluctant when Yashura Family was mentioned. As a mother, she loved Bhela dearly, and was the one to believe in her daughter before everyone else. She believed in her daughter’s future. That was why she was first to oppose Bhela’s engagement when the sour rumors about the heir of the Yashura Family started. Never would she expect that her Malikh Family would be in dire straits so suddenly they needed Yashura Family’s help to get them out of this mess.</p>\n<p>“Have you sent someone to inform Yulong, mother?” Bhela asked.</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh shook her head. Bhela reckoned with Elder Jhamil gaining influence so fast, her mother wouldn’t know anyone to trust in this kind of situation.</p>\n<p>The girl then gave her mother a glass of water to ease her down. “I’ll let him know then,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Dear,” Madam Malikh brushed her daughter’s hair as she smiled helplessly, “showing your face in Yashura Family might complicate things…”</p>\n<p>Bhela patted her mother’s hands and assured her, “Don’t worry, mother,” she said, “I’ll ask favors from people I know from Elzhier Family.”</p>\n<p>Bhela thought her parents would go along with her arrangement. Madam Malikh hung open her lips as if she wanted to say something, but then she tightened her smile in the end. Unexpectedly, it was a weak voice that disagreed instead.</p>\n<p>“Bhela… don’t...” her father whispered weakly.</p>\n<p>“Dear?” mother leaned on toward his mouth.</p>\n<p>“What is it, father?” Bhela, too, leaned closer.</p>\n<p>“Don’t… ask… don’t… favor… purple...” the sickly patriarch’s voice turned hoarse and defragmented before he completed his sentences. Bhela and her mother quickly shushed him, they couldn’t afford to see the sick father forcing himself with this condition. Even after two minutes, he still struggled to tell his words to his daughter. Though eventually he fell to slumber by himself after his wife tried to put him to sleep with her eyes wet with tears.</p>\n<p>Beside her mother, Bhela picked a bamboo fan and used it to make a breeze for her father’s sleep to be more comfortable. Her expression was flat and straight the entire time, but inside, she was disturbed by the words her father failed to tell her.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>For as long as the Yashuras knew him, their Young Master Shira Yashura lived alone in his house. The only other person who should’ve been living here, his father, didn’t come home for months already. So ever since his uncle let him live in his house a few years back, Shira enjoyed an independent lifestyle he’d take for granted one of these days.</p>\n<p>At night, his schedule often filled with working on painting commissions Good-Natured Spirit gave him. Which, unfortunately, not something he wished for people to know. This part of his schedule was one of his secrets, if known by a certain meddlesome cousin, hell would surely be waiting for him.</p>\n<p>“I told you again and again,” a voice from behind him blurted, “you should’ve shown the boobs a little more.”</p>\n<p>Shira turned his head and groaned when he found the Nalaq’s annoying face a little bit too close. “Can you knock the door first?”</p>\n<p>“No way. I came through the wall. Door? What is door? Never use the thing since ages ago.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t creep up from behind, then. At least preserve your dignity as a Nalaq.”</p>\n<p>“I told you, don’t call me Nalaq,” Good-Natured Spirit hissed. “Anyway, boobs! The bweebs!! Make it more sexy! More bold and open!”</p>\n<p>“That’s not what we agreed on,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“Just a little, man. A little dot--tiny nipply dot--that’s all I’m asking for.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t push it, old man.”</p>\n<p>“Ah! You’re not fun anymore,” Good-Natured Spirit moaned in disatisfaction. In addition of Nalaq, Good-Natured Spirit was never fond of being called old. He died in his early thirty. So he retained the look, and he--according to himself--was still as handsome as ever. “Ah, forget it,” he waved his hand lazily. “Your drawings are second-rate porns anyway.”</p>\n<p>“You’re not paying for this one again?” Shira asked.</p>\n<p>“Not this one. Too safe. Don’t want it. At least make her boobs and butt bigger for the next time.”</p>\n<p>Shira sighed and wrapped it up for tonight. Everytime Good-Natured Spirit cancelled the commission's Shira wouldn’t have any choice but selling the paintings half-baked to a peddler he knew. Not even a half price, he’d be lucky if the rejected paintings would sell even one-fifth from Good-Natured Spirit’s usual payment.</p>\n<p>While Shira was tidying up his room, Good-Natured Spirit looked at the lady in the painting. The Nalaq said, “Hmm. I gotta say, man, despite your second-rate skill you’re natural when it comes to drawing faces. Especially the eyes. How should I say this… those aren’t the eyes of cheap bitches usually have, I tell you.”</p>\n<p>Shira didn’t know whether he should feel flattered or not. After he tidied the room and hid the naughty painting carefully, he prepared to go to sleep.</p>\n<p>“Oh, by the way,” Good-Natured Spirit said as Shira changed his shirt, “I’ve checked on your girl, brat. She’s a real good beauty, alright. Her talent too is not to be scoffed at. And also--boobs.”</p>\n<p>Shira glanced at him with tightened brows. “I’ll be troubled if they somehow trace it back to me in case the Young Lady of Malikh Family was assaulted.”</p>\n<p>“Hehe, relax man, I’ll never touch my buddy’s chick. We’re buddies, aren’t we?”</p>\n<p>Shira wanted to say no but he felt it’d be better for him not to comment on that. He then hurriedly kicked out the Nalaq so he could get some sleep in peace.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In almost all of Mossack race traditions, ngajen ceremony held monthly in villages near a mountain. It was one of those legacy of ancient Mossack that still around simply because of its practice brought safety to the people. Originally was a session of prayers and offerings to calm down Selaqs which dwelling on the mountains--they had to, because many stories being passed down in every families that even ancient tribe chieftains and heroes couldn’t do nothing if waves of Selaqs rampaged over the southern lands. Though, as the cost of ceremony getting more expensive as the time went on and getting more political, nowadays it became a time of feasts for big families to assert their surrounding influence. And a time of feasts where small and independent families gained side incomes from providing food and good for the big families’ feats. Ngajen ceremony was also the main reason why there was a weird rule for every Mossack-rooted families, tribes, and clans, that saying the leaders must be someone of a great cook--the majority of them were simply foodies.</p>\n<p>“And thus, Shira my boy--” the patriarch said as he played with his thick moustache, “--us southern people are naturally different from those imperialist western Haldeens and those warmongers feudalists of eastern Kaya. We don’t simply become leaders because of our noble bloodlines or merits and achievements in battle but simply because of food. This is an important lesson, my boy: no matter one hails from a noble blood or being a simple commoner, no matter one’s an enemy or ally, in the end, everyone’s going to eat happily and peacefully when we southern cooks shove foods up in their mouths. Remember that.”</p>\n<p>Shira Yashura quietly nodded. He didn’t plan to learn cooking from the start but, as the heir of Yashura Family, spending effort on foods probably one of the most important lessons before he became the next Patriarch of Yashura Family.</p>\n<p>“So you understand. Good. Sooner or later you’ll understand being strong is not everything, having talent is not everything,” the patriarch said. “Look at your father, for instance. He’s the only one in Badril Village who has an Unique class since… I don’t know, many many years. He’s pretty badass, eh? But why is that the one who ended up being the patriarch was me?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, Uncle Shuro, please do tell me.”</p>\n<p>Shuro Yashura, the patriarch uncle, smiled as he looked at his obedient nephew. He then half-bragging said, “Because he can only boil water, that’s why. Cooking is a great heritage of our ancestors thus those who have no talent on it as to be satisfied with being a second-rate Mossack. The only reason why people like me always ended up becoming the leader of clans because we Mossack appreciate food to a very high degree. Justice is food. Food is justice. With great cooking comes great responsibility.”</p>\n<p>But from the side a sour voice butted in, “Ohh. You’ll never know how much bullshit my father made up just now.”</p>\n<p>Uncle and nephew turned their heads to see a daughter pop her head from the window. Apparently, Mila Yashura had just returned from doing morning errands.</p>\n<p>“What are you guys doing anyway?” she asked. Apparently, in the kitchen, she saw her father and cousin shredding a ridiculous amount of coconuts. No one else was here in the kitchen, so Mila asked, “Did you two really do these by all yourselves?”</p>\n<p>“Of course,” her father, the revered patriarch, said as his hand vigorously shredded coconut. He couldn’t hide the annoying proud smile on his mustache filled face.</p>\n<p>“Since dawn?” Mila asked again suspiciously.</p>\n<p>“Food is justice. Justice is food. With great cooking comes great responsibility. Shredding coconut is one of the fundamental lessons for Shira to become a great patriarch in the future.”</p>\n<p>“Well,” Mila commented, “that’s dumb.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, girl! What do you know? You know nothing about the important philosophy behind every essence of coconuts,” Shuro Yashura exploded. “Since you a girl who don’t have to lead the family then probably you’ll never understand. You’ll never have to understand the hidden substance of every food you’ve eaten! Almost every Mossack delicacies made with coconuts. That Bulayak Satay sauce you like so much is made with coconut milk as a base! And don’t forget goat stew! And baked shredded coconuts cookies! And rendang! You name it. Coconuts have been granted us with delicious foods ever since ancestors were hunters-gatherers! Our very roots of being the descendants of ancient Mossack race can be traced as long as one ponder the mystery behind every shred of coconuts! Look at ancient empires! The ancient Aratararadararam Empire, for an instance, five thousands years ago, formed their empire solely by cultivating lots of coconut trees! They’re building civilizations relying only on the blessing of coconuts! That’s how great coconuts are! Only us who were born to lead our very empire can understand how miraculous are to be feeling joyous in pondering the great essence of shredded coconuts. You don’t know this much then you’re a dumb girl, eh. What a waste of a daughter you are!!” After taking a deep breath, Patriarch Shuro snorted at his impudent daughter, then glanced at Shira, smiling. “Isn’t that right, Shira my boy?”</p>\n<p>That was dumb. Even Shira knew that much. Because of that he kept his head hung low and focused on his task of shredding coconuts, pretending not to hear the question coming at him.</p>\n<p>“See?” the patriarch smirked. “He’s too absorbed by the grace of shredding coconuts he doesn’t notice my words.”</p>\n<p>Mila rolled her eyes, began to ignore her father. “Anyway, Shira! Have you heard the story about that girl Malikh beating up the best Archer kid single-handedly?”</p>\n<p>Shira of course knew about the archery duel that happened yesterday. Because Yashura Family and Malikh Family were entangled in a planned marriage, almost everyone in Yashura Family--including servants and clueless children--were talking about it. Yet he couldn’t raise his head and answer. Do that, and his uncle Shuro would know he only pretended to be interested in shredding coconuts. He’d only hurt his uncle’s feelings that way. Thus, in spite of Mila being overly loud today, all Shira needed to do was shredding and shredding and sometimes stopped to feel the shredded coconuts with his fingers, releasing a solemn sigh, as if he found something profound in every fiber of shredded coconuts.</p>\n<p>“That’s my boy, you understand all too well after all,” Shuro Yashura nodded in satisfaction. He was relieved his successor could be that enlightened by the grace of shredded coconuts. He then glared at his own blood daughter, who supposed to be the princess of the family, nagging so loudly that she stood in borderline of being a tomboy girl and a fussy aunty.</p>\n<p>“Oh, man, just leave him alone, would ya? Just think how many years for him to catch up with his girl--the more you hold him back the more people talk shit about him, father!”</p>\n<p>“Please dear! Is that how you talk with your father? I’m not holding him back, okay?” Patriarch Shuro Yashura then asked Shira, “do I hold you back, Shira my boy?”</p>\n<p>Shira further lowered his head and pretended not to hear that as if he was a turtle.</p>\n<p>“Better be careful. He’s too deep in coconuts he doesn’t even hear me,” the patriarch gave his daughter a glare.</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura rolled her eyes. She crouched and disappeared from the window view, then stood up again a moment later. Her hand clutching a pebble.</p>\n<p>The patriarch gawked, “Oi, what are you--”</p>\n<p>Mila aimed the pebble at Shira and it hit his head with an audible knock.</p>\n<p>“Thousands of gods!” Shira swore.</p>\n<p>“Too deep my ass,” Mila sneered. Unlike her father, she knew too well whenever Shira playing dumb.</p>\n<p>“What do you want?” Shira asked as he rubbed his head.</p>\n<p>“Let’s train your sword skill. You don’t want to face your fiancée with that crappy skill of yours, do you?”</p>\n<p>Shira glanced at his uncle unwillingly. “Do I have to meet with Bhela in her Family?”</p>\n<p>“That’s right, Shira my boy. You rarely visit other houses during ngajen ceremony but old folks from the Elder Council think this is a good time to show Malikh Family our good will,” Shuro Yashura said. “Remember to pray for their patriarch’s health too. He’s your father best friend, after all.”</p>\n<p>As if waiting for Patriarch Shuro’s completed his words, the door of the kitchen knocked at the very moment. A tall gray-haired old man entered. He had a posture that was straight and sharp, classy western-style butler uniform that hadn’t had looked worn out in spite no tailors around to know how to sew the said uniform, and his hand was balanced to hold a tray with a dozen elixirs on top of it with his left hand fingers, while his right hand rested on his back as if he followed an etiquette stranger to most of the villagers. He was the sole butler in Yashura Family--and perhaps, the only butler that ever employed in Badril VIllage.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira, this month’s elixirs your father sent for you have arrived,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Thank you, Yulong.”</p>\n<p>As usual, Shira drank elixirs his father sent abroad without a rest. The content was painfully bitter, thank goodness Yulong provided brown sugars for the boy to nibble after he drank those. His father Jhuro Yashura said--in a letter from abroad--that the elixirs were some kind of nutrient custom-made only for Shira, were expensive, so they could only afford them every one or two months.</p>\n<p>“How do you feel, Shira my boy?”</p>\n<p>Shira said as he munched a brown sugar to dismiss the bitter after taste. “Uh-hm. Better?”</p>\n<p>The family always thought they were a level-boost potion, Jhuro once sent a potion that could increase Shira’s level up to Level 3 in a single gulp after all. But the elixirs seemed to do nothing other than let Shira sleep comfortably at night. Still, his relatives, especially Mila, put their hopes on the resourceful Jhuro Yashura to nurture his own son--the heir of Yashura Family.</p>\n<p>Seeing the lack of enthusiasm in his nephew’s eyes, Patriarch Shuro laughed and said, “Haha. If those don’t work on your progress problems, don’t let it bother you! Your father worked very hard as an instructor in second-rank school and he’d definitely send a better elixir, like that one from three years ago!”</p>\n<p>“Oh,” Shira nodded. The elixir from three years ago was special. He knew it the moment he drank the potion. The warm feeling surrounding his manasphere was special, as with only drinking from one bottle, he leveled up 2 levels overnight.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>After that his uncle let him go out of the kitchen, since it was promised that Shira would do errands for his aunt every morning.</p>\n<p>When he was heading off for his duty, Shira Yashura got pranked by Good-Natured Spirit in the hallway, popped out his head from a wall and cried, “Boo!”--which Shira ignored because Yulong the butler was walking behind him.</p>\n<p>Yulong said with a polite baritone voice of his, “Young Master Shira, do you perhaps would visit the peddler today?”</p>\n<p>Shira looked at the butler. The matter about him doing business with a peddler wasn’t known to the family; but since Yulong wasn’t a Yashura and had been taking care of him since little, he eventually knew about the few investment deals that Shira never talked about. After collecting his thoughts, the boy replied to Yulong’s question, “Depends on the errand I receive, really. My aunt still hasn’t given my errands this morning,” the boy said.</p>\n<p>“I see, Patriarch Shuro took your time since early morning, so if madam doesn’t take pity for you then young master would finish today’s morning errands a little too late.”</p>\n<p>“The market would be too crowded if that happened,” Shira lamented. It couldn’t be helped. Boys and girls around ages of nine and sixteen--before they received coming-of-age ceremony--had to finish several trivial tasks each morning from both parents. It was a custom mainly to educate filial piety, though some smart parents and big family policies would give errands for the young’uns to make them do things that were beneficial for their futures, like street smarts and forming their own social circles outside the playmates they met everyday. Because his mother wasn’t here since he was a baby, and his father never came home for months, it was his aunt who always gave him errands.</p>\n<p>“Young Master,” Yulong stopped him again, “I’m glad for Young Master taking initiatives to improve your life. You grow too fast for this old butler to look after you. But as a child stepping into the adult world, please let me give you a small advice.”</p>\n<p>“I’m all ears, Yulong.”</p>\n<p>Yulong said, “You cannot guarantee everyone’s nature all around you, Young Master. Especially those who come approaching you with impure motives. I hope Young Master understands this, and to not make friends with nasty people.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit, who was around, snorted.</p>\n<p>Shira pretended he didn’t hear the Nalaq and nodded at the butler’s words. “You don’t have to worry about the peddler. Even though he’s been peddling for two years now, I found the fella got a pretty good sense.”</p>\n<p>“Hearing your words relieves me greatly. Thank you.”</p>\n<p>Afterward, Yulong excused himself as he needed to check the servants’ works for the arrangement of Ngajen Ceremony. The butler unassumingly walked on the side of the corridor, avoiding Good-Natured Spirit who was floating in the way, as if he knew there was something unpleasant floating in the way.</p>\n<p>“So long, fucker,” Good-Natured Spirit flashed his middle finger to Yulong’s back who just passed him by. Of course, the old butler didn’t show any reaction to his insult.</p>\n<p>“Why did you always do that to him?” Shira said to him with a frown.</p>\n<p>“This middle finger?” Good-Natured Spirit asked back.</p>\n<p>“No, the insult.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit grinned.</p>\n<p>“You know nothing about this middle finger, eh? Hehehh heh....”</p>\n<p>Yulong was someone Shira heartily respected. He always used polite language when talking to the butler. Because of that he was irked by the way Good-Natured Spirit sneered.</p>\n<p>“I need to sell the painting you rejected before the market becomes too crowdy. Let’s go,” he said. Bantering with Good-Natured Spirit would only make him more cocky, so Shira held the urge to humor his annoying behavior and headed off to the village’s market.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Back in the kitchen, Mila stayed with his father--who still shredding coconuts--while she read from a see-through board in front of her.</p>\n<p>“Ugh… his experience didn’t even change a single point,” Mila groaned.</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro too engrossed himself in coconut to realize what his daughter was doing just now. “You did a <b>Status Window</b> on him?”</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura nodded. Her face was sour though. “Look at this, old man. See what’s wrong with the number?”</p>\n<p>“Hah, his <b>Dodge Rating</b> getting crazier than before,” Shuro Yashura said with his fingers rubbing his moustache.</p>\n<p>“No! Look, father--his combat attributes, look closely! <b>Strength</b>, <b>Agility</b>, <b>Dexterity</b>! All of them pitifully underdeveloped. And look at the <b>Wisdom</b> attribute now!”</p>\n<p>“Ooh, his Wisdom’s pretty high. I knew his head’s pretty good. No wonder he could ponder the real meaning of shredded coconuts… he’s really a wise kid, after all.”</p>\n<p>“Please be serious, father. This is a serious matter.”</p>\n<p>“I’m serious,” Shuro the patriarch frowned. “And shredded coconut is a serious matter too!”</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura took a deep breath. Getting emotional over her father’s stupidity would only complicate the conversation.</p>\n<p>“Did you really hear the nickname they gave you...?” Mila asked him as she massaged her forehead. “It’s toothless Yashura. Toothless!”</p>\n<p>“Who said that?”</p>\n<p>“People.”</p>\n<p>“Fuck them people,” Shuro said. He never heard those old fogies calling him “toothless”, so he reckoned young'uns were the ones who came up with that. He sighed. For them to call this patriarch who always held the title of the best cook in Badril Village, those young people really didn’t have a good sense in them.</p>\n<p>“Because there’s Uncle Jhuro’s watching us from behind as a patriarch you can be toothless incompetent all you want, father, but--”</p>\n<p>“Oi, mind your words!”</p>\n<p>“--But!” Mila asserted despite her father started to pout after being called an incompetent, “but my generation is going to be harsh. No one as skilled and as strong as Uncle Jhuro appeared in the young’uns to be the guardian lion as our emblem is supposed to be.”</p>\n<p>“That is maybe but what are you trying to say here?”</p>\n<p>“What I’m saying is Shira can’t afford to be another toothless patriarch. You’re a support class, father, a <b>Specialist</b> like me. In our Badril Village history no matter how great your cooking is and no matter how wide our connections are if a conflict to arise a support class as a patriarch, nobody’d take us seriously--that is, unless another Unique Class who can afford to stay here in the village appears to scare them annoying people.”</p>\n<p>“Hoo, it seems you’ve been using your head a lot recently. That’s quite surprising.”</p>\n<p>Mila pursed her lips.</p>\n<p>“Unlike a certain carefree toothless patriarch, me and most family members concerned about Shira’s progress stuck as a Level 3 Novice. And what’s more, that girl Bhela Malikh--I don’t like what she did with her hair.”</p>\n<p>“Her hair?”</p>\n<p>“She cut her hair short. I confirmed it myself.”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro shook his head. He knew what his daughter was worrying about. “Girl, nephew Bhela has been away from the village and our dull way of thinking. She had been living with people in different cultures and customs these past two years. Maybe she cut her hair because she wants to follow fashion. Like that Aunty Yarly’s girl who suddenly has her lips red with lip balms, see? The young'uns are always doing it whenever foreigners come bringing their latest fads with them. You’re thinking too much.”</p>\n<p>“Why does everyone think Bhela Malikh is just some brainless girl who doesn’t know what she’s doing?” Mila Yashura frowned. “She’s smart, father. Even Shira knows she’s smart. You know what Shira said when I told him her fiancée has short hair now?--”</p>\n<p>She smirked.</p>\n<p>“--He said, ‘the engagement’s not going to work’.”</p>\n<p>“Bah! He’s been saying that shit for years!”</p>\n<p>“I know, I know!” Mila said. “But this time he’s serious. He said that with a punchable face as if he was saying ‘see, I told you’. His face looked punchable, I tell ya!”</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura was genuinely angry. This time, Patriarch Shuro Yashura didn’t immediately reply. He looked at his daughter, scratched his head, said, “So, in short, you worried about we can’t do nothing if Bhela is serious about cutting her hair to state her stance on her own engagement?”</p>\n<p>“Well, yeah! Of course I am. Only widows who cut hairs like that!”</p>\n<p>“You think it’s because she doesn’t like being paired with our Shira who is much weaker than her?”</p>\n<p>“Well, duh, old man, you’re still asking the obvious?”</p>\n<p>“Then don’t worry, look again at his status,” Shuro Yashura tossed back the status window back to his daughter. Its lifespan hasn't yet expired, so it was still showing Shira’s attributes and status as Level 3 Novice. “See what’s wrong in there?”</p>\n<p>Mila opened her mouth, “His combat attributes--”</p>\n<p>“No, look again!” Shuro cut off.</p>\n<p>Despite knitting her eyebrows, Mila still didn’t catch his father’s drift.</p>\n<p>Seeing his daughter had a hard time figuring it out, Shuro Yashura revealed, “His elemental affinity. See?”</p>\n<p>“It’s <b>Water</b> elemental affinity. It’s not that rare. What’s wrong with it?”</p>\n<p>“Well, he’s still a Novice. Getting a class still far away from him.”</p>\n<p>When a person reached the first barrier at Level 10 and got his class, there was a chance for him to aversed in one or more elementals and largely transformed, or perhaps even enhanced, the skills he would get from the class he acquired. Not everyone, but the chance was more than fifty-fifty. Aside from the rare ones, four base elementals that commonly appeared were <b>Fire</b>, <b>Wind</b>, <b>Lightning</b>, and <b>Water</b>--Mila wasn’t sure what so special for her cousin acquired an affinity over one of those base elementals.</p>\n<p>“Have you seen anyone with an elemental affinity in his Novice years?” her father asked.</p>\n<p>“It’s rare…” Mila was unsure, “can’t say I have.”</p>\n<p>“You haven’t. I have,” Shuro Yashura said. “Twenty seven years ago. Your Uncle Jhuro had a huge fight with grandfather and he ran away into the Mossy Forest behind the mountain--for nearly three weeks. He ate wild fruits. He ate monster meat also. But in the last three days he got unlucky and got poisoned by a snake monster ten levels above him. He struggled with death. Alone in that forest. But he lived. The fool then decided the forest was too dangerous for him and he returned back home.”--and got to experience a near-death situation again after their furious father almost pummeled him to pulp, Patriarch Shuro’s memories drifted.</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura listened. She knew the story of how his uncle survived alone in Mossy Forest--it was crazy, a kind of legend for the young’uns today. That was the first story amongst stories about the Badril Village’s last Unique Class warrior--Jhuro Yashura the Blackfang Swordsman--the story that first made him famous in the village for his unordinary bravery and recklessness.</p>\n<p>Shuro Yashura asked her daughter, “You know what happened after that, right?”</p>\n<p>She nodded.</p>\n<p>“Uncle awakened his rare <b>Poison</b> elemental affinity.”</p>\n<p>And Jhuro Yashura wasn’t even reached Level 10 back then.</p>\n<p>There was an unspoken law of the system most people didn’t know. A premonition, or sign, more appropriately, that if a Novice got an elemental before acquiring a class, chance was, an Unique class would be waiting for him.</p>\n<p>“See what I’m getting at?” Shuro Yashura said with a smile. “Time will reveal it, you don’t have to worry. Sooner or later, there’ll be another Unique class in our Yashura Family.”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>That morning the family getting busy preparing for ngajen ceremony; family officials, the servants, even brats too, were busy with their own errands. Usually with a few of copper kobe coins older kids could secretly pass their morning errands to the little ones--as lazier and richer kids like Shira wasn’t foreign to the practice, but unfortunately he couldn’t find some kids to bribe even on days like this. Not that he wasn’t happy about it. The errand his aunt gave him accidentally had something to do in the market, the destination he’d go to sell his painting today anyway.</p>\n<p>“Is it me or someone’s been staring at me since I stepped out of my family’s gate?”</p>\n<p>“It’s not you,” Good-Natured Spirit replied to Shira's question. “It seems the stalker Big-Boobed Sect sent today was particularly sloopy, kinda annoying.”</p>\n<p>“Oh yeah? How many of them are following me?” Shira asked half-heartedly.</p>\n<p>“What? You don’t believe them Big-Boobed Sect always spying on us?”</p>\n<p>Shira shrugged. Good-Natured Spirit was right--the boy didn’t believe his ramblings about all-girl sect always hiding in Badril Village’s shadows, especially with those padded words about them being beautiful and having bountiful bodies. He didn’t believe it because he still got some common sense. Not to mention hidden sects, even some decent clans and schools wouldn’t bother with ordinary places like Badril Village.</p>\n<p>And thus as he had feared, the market was already crowded by then. The moment Shira realized it, Good-Natured Spirit already drifted away by the sight of excitement in gambling dens and beautiful young wives from Elzhier Family sold street foods. As it turned out, it was stamped on the Nalaq’s mind to get off Shira as soon as they came to the market lest the boy’d use him for errands one way or another. The peddler Shira acquainted with was getting a good crowd as he laid his wares behind his wagon.</p>\n<p>“Monkey!”</p>\n<p>The peddler behind the wares turned his head. He had a funny face, a rare trait that made him resemble a monkey. And there was no coincidence everyone called him Monkey. When Monkey slightly wandered his eyes through the crowd and saw Shira, he waved his hands to the grunting customers and told them he’d close his shop for a while.</p>\n<p>“Well, well, isn’t this our Young Master Shira blessing us with his presence?” the smiling Monkey briskly approached as he rubbed his palms excitedly. “Can I help you young master?”</p>\n<p>Shira stepped back when Monkey got too close. “Monkey, you better stop being creepy whenever I come visit you.”</p>\n<p>“You hurt me, young master. There’s nothing creepy about our business relationship.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, it’s your face. Don’t make me regret selling my painting to you.”</p>\n<p>“Haha, surely you jest, Young Master Shira--I’m trying my best to maintain a professional face from now on!” Monkey said that then immediately took a small peek at the content. “Your skill is just getting better and better, master. I’m sure this will sell well, Master!”</p>\n<p>“What’s with the master thing?”</p>\n<p>“How dare for me to call you ‘Young Master’ while you yourself are already an expert at this stage?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t want our relationship getting creepier than it already is,” Shira said, then he took out a pouch of coins. “Anyways, I got an errand from my aunt, so give me the thirteen dried spices worth all this money.”</p>\n<p>“What kind of spice?”</p>\n<p>“All kinds of spices.”</p>\n<p>“Of course, of course, I’ll give you a discount, just to celebrate your improvement in the path of drawing, Master.”</p>\n<p>By the time Shira got himself a basketful of spices, Monkey’s grin getting more annoying. The stereotypical fat and slimy merchants looked innocent compared to him. After Shira threw a frowning glance at him, he <em>reluctantly</em> admitted, “Young master may not know this, but recently I’ve got an Alchemist partner with me who was trying to be independent from his family,” he said. “And I must tell you, young master, this family is a many-hundreds of years Alchemists family, and you also must know he’s not kicked out of incompetente--”</p>\n<p>Shira cut his roundabout pitching. “You want me to back the Alchemist?”</p>\n<p>“Mmm...yes….” Monkey nodded with a wry smile.</p>\n<p>The boy’s eyes wandered through the peddler’s wares before looked at him in the eyes. “Even I must tread through the game of cat and dog with the elders because of the rules,” he explained to Monkey, who in turn, could only smile helplessly.</p>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>Mossack’s custom dictates children who haven’t gone through their coming of age ceremony--usually at the age of sixteen--to not being involved in politics and commerce. This is the reason why Shira--as he mostly acquired money winning through streaks of chess games with Good-Natured Spirit--couldn’t recklessly flaunt his personal wealth in public.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>The risk of having a relationship gone sour with this young master, Monkey knew that. It was unlikely for an upstart peddler to be relied on by a future patriarch of a big family, and he wholeheartedly believed it was unwise to create a trivial misunderstanding with Young Master Shira Yashura. After all, it was only one year until Shira would have his own coming of age ceremony. Therefore, Monkey didn’t want to impose on the Young Master’s kindness too much and quickly changed the topic with something he’d prepared beforehand.</p>\n<p>“This is a <b>Boost Elixir</b> concocted by my partner. He might not a 2nd-Tier Alchemist yet but I assure you, Young Master Shira, the elixir’s potent power won’t lose against any experts you’ll find anywhere!” Monkey said with his over-excited sales pitch, which made him look more funny than usual, “This humble bottle was scientifically proven to increase a person’s level as long as he is below the age of twenty! To date, this Boost Elixir has 100% effectiveness in increasing the user’s level! Young master, you are very lucky--you can have this miraculous elixir just for half of the original price today!”</p>\n<p>Though it was clear Monkey meant no harm, Shira narrowed his eyes at the pedder.</p>\n<p>“Did someone pay you to make me drink it?” he asked suspiciously.</p>\n<p>“You jest again, Young Master… ha ha… haaa….” Monkey awkwardly laughed as he tried to hide his dampened enthusiasm. “Why don’t you try it first, Young Master Shira. You don’t have to pay if you didn’t get to graduate from Level 3 Novice.”</p>\n<p>Eventually, Shira drank the Boost Elixir within a gulp, not because he believed its miraculous effect, but because he was weak for free and discounted goods.</p>\n<p>“Your EXP bar didn’t even budge a little,” Monkey muttered with a meek voice.</p>\n<p>“The liquid is surprisingly well made though. Is this really made by someone you know?”</p>\n<p>“I said before, Young Master. The one who made this hailed from an old Alchemist family that even outside South Tiramikal Kingdom their last name still can be a pretty big deal. I’m pretty confident that--normally--this elixir will have a 100% success rate for leveling up whoever drinks it!”</p>\n<p>“Such a confident boast. Are you perhaps implying that my case is not <em>normally</em>?”</p>\n<p>“He hehe, you surely joke. You know that I don’t mean any harm, young master.”</p>\n<p>Shira of course knew it. And the other thing he also knew, that if it was a really impressive elixir he just drank by now, the usual Monkey wouldn’t utter a single phrase of the word “free”, regardless how many times the elixir failed to deliver its promise.</p>\n<p>Shira looked at Monkey suspiciously, “You’re Monkey, aren’t you? Not someone brainwashed by my family’s enemy or something like that? You know, by vampires.”</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira… now your joke is not even funny--something like a poor peddler to be brainwashed only appears in stories. Vampires are some unfounded folklore.”</p>\n<p>“Monkey I know is stupid. If not brainwashed, then he definitely manipulated to sell a fake elixir to someone from big families.”</p>\n<p>Before Monkey was able to retort that, a cold voice came from the wagon. “Young Master Yashura, I don’t mind if you pinpoint Monkey’s stupidity and make assumptions about him muchever you want. But to call my elixir is fake, I can’t stand and watch around anymore.”</p>\n<p>A man appeared from the wagon Monkey had, had an appearance of the stereotypical scholar Shira had in mind--though, by the way he crossed his arms pompously, he seemed to have a pride worthy of someone hailed from big families.</p>\n<p>“You’re the Alchemist?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, you call me Snake--don’t ask for my real name,” the Alchemist said.</p>\n<p>One would hide his name if he didn’t want to be associated with his family anymore. So Shira didn’t ask. He looked at the scholarly Alchemist, then at the peddler. One was the Snake and the other one was the Monkey.</p>\n<p>Shira found some sort of strange camradice between them. “I see, so both of you decided to be a partner for life.”</p>\n<p>“Not for life, no. Spare me. It’s better for me to ditch this stupid ape as soon as he outlives his usefulness.”</p>\n<p>“Heey! Don’t say ditching in front of me!” Monkey protested. Snake ignored him without pretense, making the impression that this scene was ordinary for them.</p>\n<p>Shira then asked Snake straightforwardly.</p>\n<p>“What kind of elixir is this?”</p>\n<p>“Didn’t Monkey tell you? A Boost Elixir. My latest masterpiece,” Snake replied.</p>\n<p>“You’re aware that your partner tried to sell your masterpiece at a half price, right? I don’t even have to pay, it was what he said before.”</p>\n<p>“It was my idea,” Snake said. “This is a simple business hack. I’m confident about my concoctions. After all, I experimented heavily on human anatomy--too heavy, even, to the point folks in my family want me gone for good. I’ve got nothing to lose here. That bottle is a prototype; it cost a lot so I planned to price it a lot.”</p>\n<p>“You want to use my bad reputation as a stepping stone, don’t you?” Shira asked with a sour smile.</p>\n<p>“Yes. Do you mind?”</p>\n<p>“No, I’d gladly make profit out of those trash talking they did behind my back--though, it seems you picked the wrong guinea pig to be your mascot for your ‘business hack’,” Shira said with a wry smile.</p>\n<p>Monkey nodded weakly. As a peddler from outside the village, he was always bothered by how nasty rumors could be, especially with some acquaintance he depended on sometimes as an important business partner.</p>\n<p>Seeing that they no longer had things to chat about, Shira said to them he’d consider putting some resources if he managed to gain some nod from the family elders after he went through the coming-of-age ceremony next year. And now that he finished selling Good-Natured Spirit’s rejected commision and completed the errand his aunt gave him, Shira then bid farewell to the two animal-nicknamed gentlemen.</p>\n<p>“Please wait, Young Master Shira.”</p>\n<p>Shira turned back his head again and found Snake, the one who called him, ran back to Monkey’s wagon to grab something.</p>\n<p>“Try to drink this one,” Snake said after trotting back hurriedly. “It’s alright, you don’t have to pay for this time too.”</p>\n<p>The current elixir Snake took out was the exact opposite from the previous one. Its container was beautiful and high-class, but the content was muddy and very low in quality. Hearing that this one was also free, Shira didn’t hesitate to drink it.</p>\n<p>The after taste was incredibly sour. Unlike any other bitter concocted elixirs or potions he ever drank. Although not much, Shira could feel his body warming up. He was surprised at the unexpected reaction.</p>\n<p>“Oohhhh!!!” Monkey cried as his eyes glued at Shira’s Status Window. “The EXP bar moved!”</p>\n<p>“What?” the surprised Shira glanced at Snake and asked slowly, “This one’s free, right?”</p>\n<p>It was in a single flash Shira did catch a strange dumbfoundedness in Snake eyes, like the result even came more shocking than him than either of Shira and Monkey. Yet the moment after he promptly regained his stoic exposure, then said to Shira, “Don’t worry, I don’t plan to take back my words,”</p>\n<p>The odd Alchemist put his hands at his back and walked back to his wagon. Before he climbed the wagon, he once again glanced at Shira, looking in a state of half-disbelief like expression</p>\n<p>As Snake disappeared into the wagon, Shira and Monkey exchanged glances.</p>\n<p>“He still has that kind of face even though he promises it to be free? You sure do have an odd friend.” Shira said.</p>\n<p>Monkey grinned. “Though an oddball, I never seen anyone with more talent in alchemy than him, like, ever.”</p>\n<p>After leaving Monkey to continue his stall, Shira saw Good-Natured Spirit again when he visited a food stall not far from Monkey’s wagon. He asked what he was doing, and the Nalaq told him there was a fool who bet a lot and won a lot in the gambling games. To lose against in gambling against someone with Good-Natured Spirit’s caliber, really--Shira sighed--he couldn’t wait for his coming-of-age ceremony next year so he too could farm on these gullible people in some friendly matches--just like what he did with Good-Natured Spirit for this past one year.</p>\n<p>“You know,” munching on some satays he bought from the market, Shira muttered when he headed home along with Good-Natured Spirit, “just then I drank this elixir that really could boost my EXP a little. I don’t know how the guy concocts it, but I have the feeling that I just drink some very expensive elixir for free.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, yeah?”</p>\n<p>On the way back to Yashura Family Shira told the Nalaq spirit about the Alchemist and his elixirs. He also told him that his status that usually wouldn’t react to normal elixirs this time moved a bit after he drank a strange low-quality elixir.</p>\n<p>“That Alchemist must be a nerd to be that sharp,” Good-Natured Spirit said as he floated lazily beside the boy.</p>\n<p>“He looks like that too. The peddler he partnered with also has some good sense in him. So I thought it’s not a loss for me to use all those foreign coins I got from you to invest on them for the next year.”</p>\n<p>“Hmm,” Good-Natured Spirit crossed his arms. “I think you should be worried.”</p>\n<p>“Worried? Why?”</p>\n<p>“You said that nerd Alchemist was the one who pushed that low-quality elixir to you, right?”</p>\n<p>“I got to drink that for free,” Shira emphasized.</p>\n<p>“He realized one little secret about you then,” Good-Natured Spirit said.</p>\n<p>Shira stopped walking. He looked at him with his head tilted.</p>\n<p>“What secret?”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit who floated before, spoke again.</p>\n<p>“You shouldn’t worry about it too much for now, brat. But, I advise you, if you are still holding dear for your lazy, peaceful village life, you should turn back and kill him right now.”</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-3/chapter-2":"<p>Dinner at Malikh Family; the family hall bustling with relatives who wanted to celebrate Bhela Malikh’s return. Even though the expensive Ngajen Ceremony drew near a good number of ducks and a goat were butchered along with their spice reserves taken out. There were laughters, there lots of people wanted to get on the good side of the only Young Lady of Malikh Family.</p>\n<p>But Bhela’s face was straight the whole time. Given choices, she’d rather have a small dinner with her mother and sick father right now.</p>\n<p>“I heard you went to Elzhier’s training facility as soon as you arrived, young lady,” a bald elder said with big smile. “That is no good. You just return home after four days of traveling. You must have a good rest first.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you for your concern, Elder Jhamil.”</p>\n<p>Bhela had experience with people during her two years abroad to know the meaning of smiles like Elder Jhamil’s--the kind of smile that didn’t reach eyes, the fake kind of smile. She always found it was uncomfortable whenever she met with one. Yet what was more uncomfortable was the fact she was the star of the party. Flatteries and congratulations flowing in. Bhela kept nodding her head and had a smiling expression on her face. No one really had a good time beside the ignorant families who came to find abundant foods to eat.</p>\n<p>Finally toward the end of the big dinner Elder Jhamil gave a few speeches and led everyone for their patriarch's health. Bhela hadn’t come home for two years, but she was alert enough to know the popular opinion going around inside the Malikh Family. She knew her father was disliked by many because the engagement he set up more than a dozen years ago, back when she wasn’t even able to speak yet, back when the Malikhs didn’t think much of it and didn’t know the girl back then would grow splendidly into a fair Young Lady. What she didn’t expect was that, Elder Jhamil, would point it out in front of other family members.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady, I’m sure you’re aware about it by now, but the one from Yashura Family is still stuck on the same level from back when you were leaving for your seminars.”</p>\n<p>“I’m aware, yes,” she said. “And?”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil smiled dryly at the question, he said, “With a partner that lazy he’d drag you sooner or later, wouldn’t he? Especially with special talent as yours, many would have second thoughts. But then how about you? Are you fine with that, Young Lady?”</p>\n<p>Bhela didn’t immediately say what was on her mind. She quietly picked the warm ginger drink they served her, drank it, while her eyes glanced at a certain direction where two maidservants who immediately glanced down the moment her eyes came into contact with theirs.</p>\n<p>Seeing that Bhela wasn’t that responsive with the idea, Elder Jhamil spoke further, “Young Lady, don’t worry, we as Malikhs only worried about your future. If you feel injustice in your heart, you must be brave, you must voice it out to your parents, Young Lady Bhela--all of us Malikhs support you for whichever path you choose! Isn’t that right, everyone?”</p>\n<p>“That’s right!” someone shouted. Then came more rougher voice--</p>\n<p>“We don’t fear those Yashura’s retaliation, Young Lady. You don’t have to be afraid they’ll come here to bully us because of that trash from Yashura Family!”</p>\n<p>“We support you, Young Lady!”</p>\n<p>“Don’t be afraid!”</p>\n<p>The dry smile on Elder Jhamil turned elated when people were chanting along with his cue. It was only when Bhela slowly put down the warm glass of ginger drink in her hand did they stop making ruckus, everyone was waiting for what Bhela was going to say next.</p>\n<p>“I think,” Bhela said with the remarkable cold expression of hers, “any engagement in the main family should be the main family’s business only.”</p>\n<p>She stopped. Not a single more soul dared to send her further flatteries until dinner was over. Even the bald Elder Jhamil, the most enthusiastic of all them, quietly sat back where he belonged.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>“Ah, young lady, please wait, Young Lady Bhela!” the bald Elder Jhamil chased her, trotting, with a box in his hands.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh frowned upon hearing the voice. But she hid her expression well as turned around and asked, “Is something the matter, Elder Jhamil?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, in fact, there’s one matter a bit inappropriate to deal in the family hall,” as soon as Elder Jhamil said that, he opened the box he carried. It was a dress. “It’s something that I get from a merchant who has a lot of dealing with people in the west. He told me this is apparently the current popular fashion for western nobles. I think it’s good for Young Lady.”</p>\n<p>Bhela studied Elder Jhamil’s expression. If the dress truly was a fashionable goods then the elder ought to have paid a quite of coins to get this. As far as Bhela Malikh remembered, Elder Jhamil she knew wasn’t this kind even when her father the patriarch married. Naturally with such an expensive homecoming gift, Bhela was alerted.</p>\n<p>“Thank you for your kindness, Elder Jhamil. Bhela will treasure this well.”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, you don’t have to mention it, Young Lady Bhela,” Elder Jhamil said with a laugh. Then, while rubbing his palms unconsciously, the bald elder began to smile--not a fake one like he usually did have, a genuine smile, one that reflected his current emotion--the smile of greed. “By the way, young lady,” he continued, “I heard you getting along well with the Young Master from the noble Blackwood Family during your time away…”</p>\n<p>“Young Lady of Blackwood Family is my friend,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“Yeah but… I also heard in the next ngajen ceremony, Young Master Blackwood would grace us with his presence… is that true?”</p>\n<p>“I wouldn’t know.”</p>\n<p>“Hehe,” Elder Jhamil chuckled knowingly. “I think things would go well if you wear that dress during ngajen ceremony, young lady.”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh said a short and ambiguous reply and tried to get away from the bald elder. After she escaped in the lone corridor, she took out the dress from the box. The said dress was glimmering under the torchlight, yet, in spite of that, Bhela wasn’t happy the slightest bit.</p>\n<p>“This kind of thing…”</p>\n<p>A proper dress for ladies of southern people was hiding everything below the collarbone. Showing more, akin to invite men to do something indecent. Bhela wasn’t a conservative to follow Mossack customes down rigidly as shown from her cutting her hair short despite the gesture usually reserved for unavailable widows. But still, something like decency of girlhood, was something even someone duller than Bhela should have. Even daring courtesans would think twice to wear this kind of provocative dress to attend a festivity made by the Mossack majority.</p>\n<p>It was distasteful. Bhela didn’t want to think too much about it. After putting back the dress, Bhela walked again to the east wing of Malikh Family where her father was resting.</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim Malikh’s sick room once used as the family’s <b>Alchemist</b> workplace. It had long been vacant, thus usually used to care sick and injured people, as it had the most complete medicinal facility in the entire Malikh Family. Upon entering the room, Bhela found the thick pungent of herbs made her head light. And still she was amazed by how loyal her mother was to taking care of her father closely when servants would need to take a breather of fresh air ten minutes inside the sick room.</p>\n<p>“Father, mother, I’m back…. Did they send some food here?”</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh, the mother, was the one who replied to Bhela. “They did. Some people might forget about the patriarch’s little family but there are still good aunties working in the kitchen,” a middle-aged woman said with a hint of sadness, helplessness, and resentment.</p>\n<p>“Does mother want some hot tea? I’ll go fetch and say my thanks for those good aunties,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“You girl, sit down. You just returned today, now you want to run around doing errands?” Madam Malikh smiled weakly. “How’s the village, dear? Does it change from the way you remembered?”</p>\n<p>“Somes changed, others stay the same, mother,” Bhela said. She got to the table and put the box Elder Jhamil gifted, then took it off her mind. She then picked a random book from the shelves. “Can I stay here for a while?” she asked while showing the book to her mother, telling her the intention that she was going to read it there.</p>\n<p>The mother’s smile turned strained. At noon, she purposely told this daughter of hers to see around the village because she was afraid, if Bhela spent too much time in this room, she would feel uncomfortable by the thick medicinal smell and grow to hate the idea of staying. Even some maidservants a few years older than her were fidgeting and eyeing for the door every time they had duty to bring a meal here. Yet, looking from her daughter’s unflinching eyes, Madam Malikh was relented in the end.</p>\n<p>“Sit here,” the mother offered her chair for her daughter, while she sat down on the edge of her husband’s bed.</p>\n<p>Bhela’s moved with small, noiseless steps, trying not to wake up her father. But it was unfortunate that her father woke up nonetheless.</p>\n<p>“Le… letter…”</p>\n<p>The quivering voice escaped his cracking dry lips.</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh wanted to retort. Not the letter again. No matter how many times she read it aloud he still thirst for the letter as if it was the only salvation left for his life. Nonetheless, she surrendered and she picked a smooth, white paper made from wood--the kind which was expensive and usually used overseas--and began to read its content.</p>\n<p>“I understand your situation. But sending help from where I am takes a while. Ask Yulong’s help for now.”</p>\n<p>As if the letter was his assurance, Patriarch Ghalim Malikh closed his eyes again.</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at her mother who folded the recently opened letter, she asked. “Whose letter is that?”</p>\n<p>“Your great-grandmother who lived overseas,” her mother said.</p>\n<p>“I see.” Bhela wasn’t sure which relative her mother mentioned, but she decided to ask something else seeing her mother’s bad mood. “Why Great-grandmother mentioned something about Yulong? Isn’t Yulong the Yashura Family’s butler, mother?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know, I reckon she told us to rely on Yashura Family instead.”</p>\n<p>The strained smile on her mother’s face made Bhela realize that even her mother was reluctant when Yashura Family was mentioned. As a mother, she loved Bhela dearly, and was the one to believe in her daughter before everyone else. She believed in her daughter’s future. That was why she was first to oppose Bhela’s engagement when the sour rumors about the heir of the Yashura Family started. Never would she expect that her Malikh Family would be in dire straits so suddenly they needed Yashura Family’s help to get them out of this mess.</p>\n<p>“Have you sent someone to inform Yulong, mother?” Bhela asked.</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh shook her head. Bhela reckoned with Elder Jhamil gaining influence so fast, her mother wouldn’t know anyone to trust in this kind of situation.</p>\n<p>The girl then gave her mother a glass of water to ease her down. “I’ll let him know then,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Dear,” Madam Malikh brushed her daughter’s hair as she smiled helplessly, “showing your face in Yashura Family might complicate things…”</p>\n<p>Bhela patted her mother’s hands and assured her, “Don’t worry, mother,” she said, “I’ll ask favors from people I know from Elzhier Family.”</p>\n<p>Bhela thought her parents would go along with her arrangement. Madam Malikh hung open her lips as if she wanted to say something, but then she tightened her smile in the end. Unexpectedly, it was a weak voice that disagreed instead.</p>\n<p>“Bhela… don’t...” her father whispered weakly.</p>\n<p>“Dear?” mother leaned on toward his mouth.</p>\n<p>“What is it, father?” Bhela, too, leaned closer.</p>\n<p>“Don’t… ask… don’t… favor… purple...” the sickly patriarch’s voice turned hoarse and defragmented before he completed his sentences. Bhela and her mother quickly shushed him, they couldn’t afford to see the sick father forcing himself with this condition. Even after two minutes, he still struggled to tell his words to his daughter. Though eventually he fell to slumber by himself after his wife tried to put him to sleep with her eyes wet with tears.</p>\n<p>Beside her mother, Bhela picked a bamboo fan and used it to make a breeze for her father’s sleep to be more comfortable. Her expression was flat and straight the entire time, but inside, she was disturbed by the words her father failed to tell her.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>For as long as the Yashuras knew him, their Young Master Shira Yashura lived alone in his house. The only other person who should’ve been living here, his father, didn’t come home for months already. So ever since his uncle let him live in his house a few years back, Shira enjoyed an independent lifestyle he’d take for granted one of these days.</p>\n<p>At night, his schedule often filled with working on painting commissions Good-Natured Spirit gave him. Which, unfortunately, not something he wished for people to know. This part of his schedule was one of his secrets, if known by a certain meddlesome cousin, hell would surely be waiting for him.</p>\n<p>“I told you again and again,” a voice from behind him blurted, “you should’ve shown the boobs a little more.”</p>\n<p>Shira turned his head and groaned when he found the Nalaq’s annoying face a little bit too close. “Can you knock the door first?”</p>\n<p>“No way. I came through the wall. Door? What is door? Never use the thing since ages ago.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t creep up from behind, then. At least preserve your dignity as a Nalaq.”</p>\n<p>“I told you, don’t call me Nalaq,” Good-Natured Spirit hissed. “Anyway, boobs! The bweebs!! Make it more sexy! More bold and open!”</p>\n<p>“That’s not what we agreed on,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“Just a little, man. A little dot--tiny nipply dot--that’s all I’m asking for.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t push it, old man.”</p>\n<p>“Ah! You’re not fun anymore,” Good-Natured Spirit moaned in disatisfaction. In addition of Nalaq, Good-Natured Spirit was never fond of being called old. He died in his early thirty. So he retained the look, and he--according to himself--was still as handsome as ever. “Ah, forget it,” he waved his hand lazily. “Your drawings are second-rate porns anyway.”</p>\n<p>“You’re not paying for this one again?” Shira asked.</p>\n<p>“Not this one. Too safe. Don’t want it. At least make her boobs and butt bigger for the next time.”</p>\n<p>Shira sighed and wrapped it up for tonight. Everytime Good-Natured Spirit cancelled the commission's Shira wouldn’t have any choice but selling the paintings half-baked to a peddler he knew. Not even a half price, he’d be lucky if the rejected paintings would sell even one-fifth from Good-Natured Spirit’s usual payment.</p>\n<p>While Shira was tidying up his room, Good-Natured Spirit looked at the lady in the painting. The Nalaq said, “Hmm. I gotta say, man, despite your second-rate skill you’re natural when it comes to drawing faces. Especially the eyes. How should I say this… those aren’t the eyes of cheap bitches usually have, I tell you.”</p>\n<p>Shira didn’t know whether he should feel flattered or not. After he tidied the room and hid the naughty painting carefully, he prepared to go to sleep.</p>\n<p>“Oh, by the way,” Good-Natured Spirit said as Shira changed his shirt, “I’ve checked on your girl, brat. She’s a real good beauty, alright. Her talent too is not to be scoffed at. And also--boobs.”</p>\n<p>Shira glanced at him with tightened brows. “I’ll be troubled if they somehow trace it back to me in case the Young Lady of Malikh Family was assaulted.”</p>\n<p>“Hehe, relax man, I’ll never touch my buddy’s chick. We’re buddies, aren’t we?”</p>\n<p>Shira wanted to say no but he felt it’d be better for him not to comment on that. He then hurriedly kicked out the Nalaq so he could get some sleep in peace.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In almost all of Mossack race traditions, ngajen ceremony held monthly in villages near a mountain. It was one of those legacy of ancient Mossack that still around simply because of its practice brought safety to the people. Originally was a session of prayers and offerings to calm down Selaqs which dwelling on the mountains--they had to, because many stories being passed down in every families that even ancient tribe chieftains and heroes couldn’t do nothing if waves of Selaqs rampaged over the southern lands. Though, as the cost of ceremony getting more expensive as the time went on and getting more political, nowadays it became a time of feasts for big families to assert their surrounding influence. And a time of feasts where small and independent families gained side incomes from providing food and good for the big families’ feats. Ngajen ceremony was also the main reason why there was a weird rule for every Mossack-rooted families, tribes, and clans, that saying the leaders must be someone of a great cook--the majority of them were simply foodies.</p>\n<p>“And thus, Shira my boy--” the patriarch said as he played with his thick moustache, “--us southern people are naturally different from those imperialist western Haldeens and those warmongers feudalists of eastern Kaya. We don’t simply become leaders because of our noble bloodlines or merits and achievements in battle but simply because of food. This is an important lesson, my boy: no matter one hails from a noble blood or being a simple commoner, no matter one’s an enemy or ally, in the end, everyone’s going to eat happily and peacefully when we southern cooks shove foods up in their mouths. Remember that.”</p>\n<p>Shira Yashura quietly nodded. He didn’t plan to learn cooking from the start but, as the heir of Yashura Family, spending effort on foods probably one of the most important lessons before he became the next Patriarch of Yashura Family.</p>\n<p>“So you understand. Good. Sooner or later you’ll understand being strong is not everything, having talent is not everything,” the patriarch said. “Look at your father, for instance. He’s the only one in Badril Village who has an Unique class since… I don’t know, many many years. He’s pretty badass, eh? But why is that the one who ended up being the patriarch was me?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, Uncle Shuro, please do tell me.”</p>\n<p>Shuro Yashura, the patriarch uncle, smiled as he looked at his obedient nephew. He then half-bragging said, “Because he can only boil water, that’s why. Cooking is a great heritage of our ancestors thus those who have no talent on it as to be satisfied with being a second-rate Mossack. The only reason why people like me always ended up becoming the leader of clans because we Mossack appreciate food to a very high degree. Justice is food. Food is justice. With great cooking comes great responsibility.”</p>\n<p>But from the side a sour voice butted in, “Ohh. You’ll never know how much bullshit my father made up just now.”</p>\n<p>Uncle and nephew turned their heads to see a daughter pop her head from the window. Apparently, Mila Yashura had just returned from doing morning errands.</p>\n<p>“What are you guys doing anyway?” she asked. Apparently, in the kitchen, she saw her father and cousin shredding a ridiculous amount of coconuts. No one else was here in the kitchen, so Mila asked, “Did you two really do these by all yourselves?”</p>\n<p>“Of course,” her father, the revered patriarch, said as his hand vigorously shredded coconut. He couldn’t hide the annoying proud smile on his mustache filled face.</p>\n<p>“Since dawn?” Mila asked again suspiciously.</p>\n<p>“Food is justice. Justice is food. With great cooking comes great responsibility. Shredding coconut is one of the fundamental lessons for Shira to become a great patriarch in the future.”</p>\n<p>“Well,” Mila commented, “that’s dumb.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, girl! What do you know? You know nothing about the important philosophy behind every essence of coconuts,” Shuro Yashura exploded. “Since you a girl who don’t have to lead the family then probably you’ll never understand. You’ll never have to understand the hidden substance of every food you’ve eaten! Almost every Mossack delicacies made with coconuts. That Bulayak Satay sauce you like so much is made with coconut milk as a base! And don’t forget goat stew! And baked shredded coconuts cookies! And rendang! You name it. Coconuts have been granted us with delicious foods ever since ancestors were hunters-gatherers! Our very roots of being the descendants of ancient Mossack race can be traced as long as one ponder the mystery behind every shred of coconuts! Look at ancient empires! The ancient Aratararadararam Empire, for an instance, five thousands years ago, formed their empire solely by cultivating lots of coconut trees! They’re building civilizations relying only on the blessing of coconuts! That’s how great coconuts are! Only us who were born to lead our very empire can understand how miraculous are to be feeling joyous in pondering the great essence of shredded coconuts. You don’t know this much then you’re a dumb girl, eh. What a waste of a daughter you are!!” After taking a deep breath, Patriarch Shuro snorted at his impudent daughter, then glanced at Shira, smiling. “Isn’t that right, Shira my boy?”</p>\n<p>That was dumb. Even Shira knew that much. Because of that he kept his head hung low and focused on his task of shredding coconuts, pretending not to hear the question coming at him.</p>\n<p>“See?” the patriarch smirked. “He’s too absorbed by the grace of shredding coconuts he doesn’t notice my words.”</p>\n<p>Mila rolled her eyes, began to ignore her father. “Anyway, Shira! Have you heard the story about that girl Malikh beating up the best Archer kid single-handedly?”</p>\n<p>Shira of course knew about the archery duel that happened yesterday. Because Yashura Family and Malikh Family were entangled in a planned marriage, almost everyone in Yashura Family--including servants and clueless children--were talking about it. Yet he couldn’t raise his head and answer. Do that, and his uncle Shuro would know he only pretended to be interested in shredding coconuts. He’d only hurt his uncle’s feelings that way. Thus, in spite of Mila being overly loud today, all Shira needed to do was shredding and shredding and sometimes stopped to feel the shredded coconuts with his fingers, releasing a solemn sigh, as if he found something profound in every fiber of shredded coconuts.</p>\n<p>“That’s my boy, you understand all too well after all,” Shuro Yashura nodded in satisfaction. He was relieved his successor could be that enlightened by the grace of shredded coconuts. He then glared at his own blood daughter, who supposed to be the princess of the family, nagging so loudly that she stood in borderline of being a tomboy girl and a fussy aunty.</p>\n<p>“Oh, man, just leave him alone, would ya? Just think how many years for him to catch up with his girl--the more you hold him back the more people talk shit about him, father!”</p>\n<p>“Please dear! Is that how you talk with your father? I’m not holding him back, okay?” Patriarch Shuro Yashura then asked Shira, “do I hold you back, Shira my boy?”</p>\n<p>Shira further lowered his head and pretended not to hear that as if he was a turtle.</p>\n<p>“Better be careful. He’s too deep in coconuts he doesn’t even hear me,” the patriarch gave his daughter a glare.</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura rolled her eyes. She crouched and disappeared from the window view, then stood up again a moment later. Her hand clutching a pebble.</p>\n<p>The patriarch gawked, “Oi, what are you--”</p>\n<p>Mila aimed the pebble at Shira and it hit his head with an audible knock.</p>\n<p>“Thousands of gods!” Shira swore.</p>\n<p>“Too deep my ass,” Mila sneered. Unlike her father, she knew too well whenever Shira playing dumb.</p>\n<p>“What do you want?” Shira asked as he rubbed his head.</p>\n<p>“Let’s train your sword skill. You don’t want to face your fiancée with that crappy skill of yours, do you?”</p>\n<p>Shira glanced at his uncle unwillingly. “Do I have to meet with Bhela in her Family?”</p>\n<p>“That’s right, Shira my boy. You rarely visit other houses during ngajen ceremony but old folks from the Elder Council think this is a good time to show Malikh Family our good will,” Shuro Yashura said. “Remember to pray for their patriarch’s health too. He’s your father best friend, after all.”</p>\n<p>As if waiting for Patriarch Shuro’s completed his words, the door of the kitchen knocked at the very moment. A tall gray-haired old man entered. He had a posture that was straight and sharp, classy western-style butler uniform that hadn’t had looked worn out in spite no tailors around to know how to sew the said uniform, and his hand was balanced to hold a tray with a dozen elixirs on top of it with his left hand fingers, while his right hand rested on his back as if he followed an etiquette stranger to most of the villagers. He was the sole butler in Yashura Family--and perhaps, the only butler that ever employed in Badril VIllage.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira, this month’s elixirs your father sent for you have arrived,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Thank you, Yulong.”</p>\n<p>As usual, Shira drank elixirs his father sent abroad without a rest. The content was painfully bitter, thank goodness Yulong provided brown sugars for the boy to nibble after he drank those. His father Jhuro Yashura said--in a letter from abroad--that the elixirs were some kind of nutrient custom-made only for Shira, were expensive, so they could only afford them every one or two months.</p>\n<p>“How do you feel, Shira my boy?”</p>\n<p>Shira said as he munched a brown sugar to dismiss the bitter after taste. “Uh-hm. Better?”</p>\n<p>The family always thought they were a level-boost potion, Jhuro once sent a potion that could increase Shira’s level up to Level 3 in a single gulp after all. But the elixirs seemed to do nothing other than let Shira sleep comfortably at night. Still, his relatives, especially Mila, put their hopes on the resourceful Jhuro Yashura to nurture his own son--the heir of Yashura Family.</p>\n<p>Seeing the lack of enthusiasm in his nephew’s eyes, Patriarch Shuro laughed and said, “Haha. If those don’t work on your progress problems, don’t let it bother you! Your father worked very hard as an instructor in second-rank school and he’d definitely send a better elixir, like that one from three years ago!”</p>\n<p>“Oh,” Shira nodded. The elixir from three years ago was special. He knew it the moment he drank the potion. The warm feeling surrounding his manasphere was special, as with only drinking from one bottle, he leveled up 2 levels overnight.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>After that his uncle let him go out of the kitchen, since it was promised that Shira would do errands for his aunt every morning.</p>\n<p>When he was heading off for his duty, Shira Yashura got pranked by Good-Natured Spirit in the hallway, popped out his head from a wall and cried, “Boo!”--which Shira ignored because Yulong the butler was walking behind him.</p>\n<p>Yulong said with a polite baritone voice of his, “Young Master Shira, do you perhaps would visit the peddler today?”</p>\n<p>Shira looked at the butler. The matter about him doing business with a peddler wasn’t known to the family; but since Yulong wasn’t a Yashura and had been taking care of him since little, he eventually knew about the few investment deals that Shira never talked about. After collecting his thoughts, the boy replied to Yulong’s question, “Depends on the errand I receive, really. My aunt still hasn’t given my errands this morning,” the boy said.</p>\n<p>“I see, Patriarch Shuro took your time since early morning, so if madam doesn’t take pity for you then young master would finish today’s morning errands a little too late.”</p>\n<p>“The market would be too crowded if that happened,” Shira lamented. It couldn’t be helped. Boys and girls around ages of nine and sixteen--before they received coming-of-age ceremony--had to finish several trivial tasks each morning from both parents. It was a custom mainly to educate filial piety, though some smart parents and big family policies would give errands for the young’uns to make them do things that were beneficial for their futures, like street smarts and forming their own social circles outside the playmates they met everyday. Because his mother wasn’t here since he was a baby, and his father never came home for months, it was his aunt who always gave him errands.</p>\n<p>“Young Master,” Yulong stopped him again, “I’m glad for Young Master taking initiatives to improve your life. You grow too fast for this old butler to look after you. But as a child stepping into the adult world, please let me give you a small advice.”</p>\n<p>“I’m all ears, Yulong.”</p>\n<p>Yulong said, “You cannot guarantee everyone’s nature all around you, Young Master. Especially those who come approaching you with impure motives. I hope Young Master understands this, and to not make friends with nasty people.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit, who was around, snorted.</p>\n<p>Shira pretended he didn’t hear the Nalaq and nodded at the butler’s words. “You don’t have to worry about the peddler. Even though he’s been peddling for two years now, I found the fella got a pretty good sense.”</p>\n<p>“Hearing your words relieves me greatly. Thank you.”</p>\n<p>Afterward, Yulong excused himself as he needed to check the servants’ works for the arrangement of Ngajen Ceremony. The butler unassumingly walked on the side of the corridor, avoiding Good-Natured Spirit who was floating in the way, as if he knew there was something unpleasant floating in the way.</p>\n<p>“So long, fucker,” Good-Natured Spirit flashed his middle finger to Yulong’s back who just passed him by. Of course, the old butler didn’t show any reaction to his insult.</p>\n<p>“Why did you always do that to him?” Shira said to him with a frown.</p>\n<p>“This middle finger?” Good-Natured Spirit asked back.</p>\n<p>“No, the insult.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit grinned.</p>\n<p>“You know nothing about this middle finger, eh? Hehehh heh....”</p>\n<p>Yulong was someone Shira heartily respected. He always used polite language when talking to the butler. Because of that he was irked by the way Good-Natured Spirit sneered.</p>\n<p>“I need to sell the painting you rejected before the market becomes too crowdy. Let’s go,” he said. Bantering with Good-Natured Spirit would only make him more cocky, so Shira held the urge to humor his annoying behavior and headed off to the village’s market.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Back in the kitchen, Mila stayed with his father--who still shredding coconuts--while she read from a see-through board in front of her.</p>\n<p>“Ugh… his experience didn’t even change a single point,” Mila groaned.</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro too engrossed himself in coconut to realize what his daughter was doing just now. “You did a <b>Status Window</b> on him?”</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura nodded. Her face was sour though. “Look at this, old man. See what’s wrong with the number?”</p>\n<p>“Hah, his <b>Dodge Rating</b> getting crazier than before,” Shuro Yashura said with his fingers rubbing his moustache.</p>\n<p>“No! Look, father--his combat attributes, look closely! <b>Strength</b>, <b>Agility</b>, <b>Dexterity</b>! All of them pitifully underdeveloped. And look at the <b>Wisdom</b> attribute now!”</p>\n<p>“Ooh, his Wisdom’s pretty high. I knew his head’s pretty good. No wonder he could ponder the real meaning of shredded coconuts… he’s really a wise kid, after all.”</p>\n<p>“Please be serious, father. This is a serious matter.”</p>\n<p>“I’m serious,” Shuro the patriarch frowned. “And shredded coconut is a serious matter too!”</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura took a deep breath. Getting emotional over her father’s stupidity would only complicate the conversation.</p>\n<p>“Did you really hear the nickname they gave you...?” Mila asked him as she massaged her forehead. “It’s toothless Yashura. Toothless!”</p>\n<p>“Who said that?”</p>\n<p>“People.”</p>\n<p>“Fuck them people,” Shuro said. He never heard those old fogies calling him “toothless”, so he reckoned young'uns were the ones who came up with that. He sighed. For them to call this patriarch who always held the title of the best cook in Badril Village, those young people really didn’t have a good sense in them.</p>\n<p>“Because there’s Uncle Jhuro’s watching us from behind as a patriarch you can be toothless incompetent all you want, father, but--”</p>\n<p>“Oi, mind your words!”</p>\n<p>“--But!” Mila asserted despite her father started to pout after being called an incompetent, “but my generation is going to be harsh. No one as skilled and as strong as Uncle Jhuro appeared in the young’uns to be the guardian lion as our emblem is supposed to be.”</p>\n<p>“That is maybe but what are you trying to say here?”</p>\n<p>“What I’m saying is Shira can’t afford to be another toothless patriarch. You’re a support class, father, a <b>Specialist</b> like me. In our Badril Village history no matter how great your cooking is and no matter how wide our connections are if a conflict to arise a support class as a patriarch, nobody’d take us seriously--that is, unless another Unique Class who can afford to stay here in the village appears to scare them annoying people.”</p>\n<p>“Hoo, it seems you’ve been using your head a lot recently. That’s quite surprising.”</p>\n<p>Mila pursed her lips.</p>\n<p>“Unlike a certain carefree toothless patriarch, me and most family members concerned about Shira’s progress stuck as a Level 3 Novice. And what’s more, that girl Bhela Malikh--I don’t like what she did with her hair.”</p>\n<p>“Her hair?”</p>\n<p>“She cut her hair short. I confirmed it myself.”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro shook his head. He knew what his daughter was worrying about. “Girl, nephew Bhela has been away from the village and our dull way of thinking. She had been living with people in different cultures and customs these past two years. Maybe she cut her hair because she wants to follow fashion. Like that Aunty Yarly’s girl who suddenly has her lips red with lip balms, see? The young'uns are always doing it whenever foreigners come bringing their latest fads with them. You’re thinking too much.”</p>\n<p>“Why does everyone think Bhela Malikh is just some brainless girl who doesn’t know what she’s doing?” Mila Yashura frowned. “She’s smart, father. Even Shira knows she’s smart. You know what Shira said when I told him her fiancée has short hair now?--”</p>\n<p>She smirked.</p>\n<p>“--He said, ‘the engagement’s not going to work’.”</p>\n<p>“Bah! He’s been saying that shit for years!”</p>\n<p>“I know, I know!” Mila said. “But this time he’s serious. He said that with a punchable face as if he was saying ‘see, I told you’. His face looked punchable, I tell ya!”</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura was genuinely angry. This time, Patriarch Shuro Yashura didn’t immediately reply. He looked at his daughter, scratched his head, said, “So, in short, you worried about we can’t do nothing if Bhela is serious about cutting her hair to state her stance on her own engagement?”</p>\n<p>“Well, yeah! Of course I am. Only widows who cut hairs like that!”</p>\n<p>“You think it’s because she doesn’t like being paired with our Shira who is much weaker than her?”</p>\n<p>“Well, duh, old man, you’re still asking the obvious?”</p>\n<p>“Then don’t worry, look again at his status,” Shuro Yashura tossed back the status window back to his daughter. Its lifespan hasn't yet expired, so it was still showing Shira’s attributes and status as Level 3 Novice. “See what’s wrong in there?”</p>\n<p>Mila opened her mouth, “His combat attributes--”</p>\n<p>“No, look again!” Shuro cut off.</p>\n<p>Despite knitting her eyebrows, Mila still didn’t catch his father’s drift.</p>\n<p>Seeing his daughter had a hard time figuring it out, Shuro Yashura revealed, “His elemental affinity. See?”</p>\n<p>“It’s <b>Water</b> elemental affinity. It’s not that rare. What’s wrong with it?”</p>\n<p>“Well, he’s still a Novice. Getting a class still far away from him.”</p>\n<p>When a person reached the first barrier at Level 10 and got his class, there was a chance for him to aversed in one or more elementals and largely transformed, or perhaps even enhanced, the skills he would get from the class he acquired. Not everyone, but the chance was more than fifty-fifty. Aside from the rare ones, four base elementals that commonly appeared were <b>Fire</b>, <b>Wind</b>, <b>Lightning</b>, and <b>Water</b>--Mila wasn’t sure what so special for her cousin acquired an affinity over one of those base elementals.</p>\n<p>“Have you seen anyone with an elemental affinity in his Novice years?” her father asked.</p>\n<p>“It’s rare…” Mila was unsure, “can’t say I have.”</p>\n<p>“You haven’t. I have,” Shuro Yashura said. “Twenty seven years ago. Your Uncle Jhuro had a huge fight with grandfather and he ran away into the Mossy Forest behind the mountain--for nearly three weeks. He ate wild fruits. He ate monster meat also. But in the last three days he got unlucky and got poisoned by a snake monster ten levels above him. He struggled with death. Alone in that forest. But he lived. The fool then decided the forest was too dangerous for him and he returned back home.”--and got to experience a near-death situation again after their furious father almost pummeled him to pulp, Patriarch Shuro’s memories drifted.</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura listened. She knew the story of how his uncle survived alone in Mossy Forest--it was crazy, a kind of legend for the young’uns today. That was the first story amongst stories about the Badril Village’s last Unique Class warrior--Jhuro Yashura the Blackfang Swordsman--the story that first made him famous in the village for his unordinary bravery and recklessness.</p>\n<p>Shuro Yashura asked her daughter, “You know what happened after that, right?”</p>\n<p>She nodded.</p>\n<p>“Uncle awakened his rare <b>Poison</b> elemental affinity.”</p>\n<p>And Jhuro Yashura wasn’t even reached Level 10 back then.</p>\n<p>There was an unspoken law of the system most people didn’t know. A premonition, or sign, more appropriately, that if a Novice got an elemental before acquiring a class, chance was, an Unique class would be waiting for him.</p>\n<p>“See what I’m getting at?” Shuro Yashura said with a smile. “Time will reveal it, you don’t have to worry. Sooner or later, there’ll be another Unique class in our Yashura Family.”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>That morning the family getting busy preparing for ngajen ceremony; family officials, the servants, even brats too, were busy with their own errands. Usually with a few of copper kobe coins older kids could secretly pass their morning errands to the little ones--as lazier and richer kids like Shira wasn’t foreign to the practice, but unfortunately he couldn’t find some kids to bribe even on days like this. Not that he wasn’t happy about it. The errand his aunt gave him accidentally had something to do in the market, the destination he’d go to sell his painting today anyway.</p>\n<p>“Is it me or someone’s been staring at me since I stepped out of my family’s gate?”</p>\n<p>“It’s not you,” Good-Natured Spirit replied to Shira's question. “It seems the stalker Big-Boobed Sect sent today was particularly sloopy, kinda annoying.”</p>\n<p>“Oh yeah? How many of them are following me?” Shira asked half-heartedly.</p>\n<p>“What? You don’t believe them Big-Boobed Sect always spying on us?”</p>\n<p>Shira shrugged. Good-Natured Spirit was right--the boy didn’t believe his ramblings about all-girl sect always hiding in Badril Village’s shadows, especially with those padded words about them being beautiful and having bountiful bodies. He didn’t believe it because he still got some common sense. Not to mention hidden sects, even some decent clans and schools wouldn’t bother with ordinary places like Badril Village.</p>\n<p>And thus as he had feared, the market was already crowded by then. The moment Shira realized it, Good-Natured Spirit already drifted away by the sight of excitement in gambling dens and beautiful young wives from Elzhier Family sold street foods. As it turned out, it was stamped on the Nalaq’s mind to get off Shira as soon as they came to the market lest the boy’d use him for errands one way or another. The peddler Shira acquainted with was getting a good crowd as he laid his wares behind his wagon.</p>\n<p>“Monkey!”</p>\n<p>The peddler behind the wares turned his head. He had a funny face, a rare trait that made him resemble a monkey. And there was no coincidence everyone called him Monkey. When Monkey slightly wandered his eyes through the crowd and saw Shira, he waved his hands to the grunting customers and told them he’d close his shop for a while.</p>\n<p>“Well, well, isn’t this our Young Master Shira blessing us with his presence?” the smiling Monkey briskly approached as he rubbed his palms excitedly. “Can I help you young master?”</p>\n<p>Shira stepped back when Monkey got too close. “Monkey, you better stop being creepy whenever I come visit you.”</p>\n<p>“You hurt me, young master. There’s nothing creepy about our business relationship.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, it’s your face. Don’t make me regret selling my painting to you.”</p>\n<p>“Haha, surely you jest, Young Master Shira--I’m trying my best to maintain a professional face from now on!” Monkey said that then immediately took a small peek at the content. “Your skill is just getting better and better, master. I’m sure this will sell well, Master!”</p>\n<p>“What’s with the master thing?”</p>\n<p>“How dare for me to call you ‘Young Master’ while you yourself are already an expert at this stage?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t want our relationship getting creepier than it already is,” Shira said, then he took out a pouch of coins. “Anyways, I got an errand from my aunt, so give me the thirteen dried spices worth all this money.”</p>\n<p>“What kind of spice?”</p>\n<p>“All kinds of spices.”</p>\n<p>“Of course, of course, I’ll give you a discount, just to celebrate your improvement in the path of drawing, Master.”</p>\n<p>By the time Shira got himself a basketful of spices, Monkey’s grin getting more annoying. The stereotypical fat and slimy merchants looked innocent compared to him. After Shira threw a frowning glance at him, he <em>reluctantly</em> admitted, “Young master may not know this, but recently I’ve got an Alchemist partner with me who was trying to be independent from his family,” he said. “And I must tell you, young master, this family is a many-hundreds of years Alchemists family, and you also must know he’s not kicked out of incompetente--”</p>\n<p>Shira cut his roundabout pitching. “You want me to back the Alchemist?”</p>\n<p>“Mmm...yes….” Monkey nodded with a wry smile.</p>\n<p>The boy’s eyes wandered through the peddler’s wares before looked at him in the eyes. “Even I must tread through the game of cat and dog with the elders because of the rules,” he explained to Monkey, who in turn, could only smile helplessly.</p>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>Mossack’s custom dictates children who haven’t gone through their coming of age ceremony--usually at the age of sixteen--to not being involved in politics and commerce. This is the reason why Shira--as he mostly acquired money winning through streaks of chess games with Good-Natured Spirit--couldn’t recklessly flaunt his personal wealth in public.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>The risk of having a relationship gone sour with this young master, Monkey knew that. It was unlikely for an upstart peddler to be relied on by a future patriarch of a big family, and he wholeheartedly believed it was unwise to create a trivial misunderstanding with Young Master Shira Yashura. After all, it was only one year until Shira would have his own coming of age ceremony. Therefore, Monkey didn’t want to impose on the Young Master’s kindness too much and quickly changed the topic with something he’d prepared beforehand.</p>\n<p>“This is a <b>Boost Elixir</b> concocted by my partner. He might not a 2nd-Tier Alchemist yet but I assure you, Young Master Shira, the elixir’s potent power won’t lose against any experts you’ll find anywhere!” Monkey said with his over-excited sales pitch, which made him look more funny than usual, “This humble bottle was scientifically proven to increase a person’s level as long as he is below the age of twenty! To date, this Boost Elixir has 100% effectiveness in increasing the user’s level! Young master, you are very lucky--you can have this miraculous elixir just for half of the original price today!”</p>\n<p>Though it was clear Monkey meant no harm, Shira narrowed his eyes at the pedder.</p>\n<p>“Did someone pay you to make me drink it?” he asked suspiciously.</p>\n<p>“You jest again, Young Master… ha ha… haaa….” Monkey awkwardly laughed as he tried to hide his dampened enthusiasm. “Why don’t you try it first, Young Master Shira. You don’t have to pay if you didn’t get to graduate from Level 3 Novice.”</p>\n<p>Eventually, Shira drank the Boost Elixir within a gulp, not because he believed its miraculous effect, but because he was weak for free and discounted goods.</p>\n<p>“Your EXP bar didn’t even budge a little,” Monkey muttered with a meek voice.</p>\n<p>“The liquid is surprisingly well made though. Is this really made by someone you know?”</p>\n<p>“I said before, Young Master. The one who made this hailed from an old Alchemist family that even outside South Tiramikal Kingdom their last name still can be a pretty big deal. I’m pretty confident that--normally--this elixir will have a 100% success rate for leveling up whoever drinks it!”</p>\n<p>“Such a confident boast. Are you perhaps implying that my case is not <em>normally</em>?”</p>\n<p>“He hehe, you surely joke. You know that I don’t mean any harm, young master.”</p>\n<p>Shira of course knew it. And the other thing he also knew, that if it was a really impressive elixir he just drank by now, the usual Monkey wouldn’t utter a single phrase of the word “free”, regardless how many times the elixir failed to deliver its promise.</p>\n<p>Shira looked at Monkey suspiciously, “You’re Monkey, aren’t you? Not someone brainwashed by my family’s enemy or something like that? You know, by vampires.”</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira… now your joke is not even funny--something like a poor peddler to be brainwashed only appears in stories. Vampires are some unfounded folklore.”</p>\n<p>“Monkey I know is stupid. If not brainwashed, then he definitely manipulated to sell a fake elixir to someone from big families.”</p>\n<p>Before Monkey was able to retort that, a cold voice came from the wagon. “Young Master Yashura, I don’t mind if you pinpoint Monkey’s stupidity and make assumptions about him muchever you want. But to call my elixir is fake, I can’t stand and watch around anymore.”</p>\n<p>A man appeared from the wagon Monkey had, had an appearance of the stereotypical scholar Shira had in mind--though, by the way he crossed his arms pompously, he seemed to have a pride worthy of someone hailed from big families.</p>\n<p>“You’re the Alchemist?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, you call me Snake--don’t ask for my real name,” the Alchemist said.</p>\n<p>One would hide his name if he didn’t want to be associated with his family anymore. So Shira didn’t ask. He looked at the scholarly Alchemist, then at the peddler. One was the Snake and the other one was the Monkey.</p>\n<p>Shira found some sort of strange camradice between them. “I see, so both of you decided to be a partner for life.”</p>\n<p>“Not for life, no. Spare me. It’s better for me to ditch this stupid ape as soon as he outlives his usefulness.”</p>\n<p>“Heey! Don’t say ditching in front of me!” Monkey protested. Snake ignored him without pretense, making the impression that this scene was ordinary for them.</p>\n<p>Shira then asked Snake straightforwardly.</p>\n<p>“What kind of elixir is this?”</p>\n<p>“Didn’t Monkey tell you? A Boost Elixir. My latest masterpiece,” Snake replied.</p>\n<p>“You’re aware that your partner tried to sell your masterpiece at a half price, right? I don’t even have to pay, it was what he said before.”</p>\n<p>“It was my idea,” Snake said. “This is a simple business hack. I’m confident about my concoctions. After all, I experimented heavily on human anatomy--too heavy, even, to the point folks in my family want me gone for good. I’ve got nothing to lose here. That bottle is a prototype; it cost a lot so I planned to price it a lot.”</p>\n<p>“You want to use my bad reputation as a stepping stone, don’t you?” Shira asked with a sour smile.</p>\n<p>“Yes. Do you mind?”</p>\n<p>“No, I’d gladly make profit out of those trash talking they did behind my back--though, it seems you picked the wrong guinea pig to be your mascot for your ‘business hack’,” Shira said with a wry smile.</p>\n<p>Monkey nodded weakly. As a peddler from outside the village, he was always bothered by how nasty rumors could be, especially with some acquaintance he depended on sometimes as an important business partner.</p>\n<p>Seeing that they no longer had things to chat about, Shira said to them he’d consider putting some resources if he managed to gain some nod from the family elders after he went through the coming-of-age ceremony next year. And now that he finished selling Good-Natured Spirit’s rejected commision and completed the errand his aunt gave him, Shira then bid farewell to the two animal-nicknamed gentlemen.</p>\n<p>“Please wait, Young Master Shira.”</p>\n<p>Shira turned back his head again and found Snake, the one who called him, ran back to Monkey’s wagon to grab something.</p>\n<p>“Try to drink this one,” Snake said after trotting back hurriedly. “It’s alright, you don’t have to pay for this time too.”</p>\n<p>The current elixir Snake took out was the exact opposite from the previous one. Its container was beautiful and high-class, but the content was muddy and very low in quality. Hearing that this one was also free, Shira didn’t hesitate to drink it.</p>\n<p>The after taste was incredibly sour. Unlike any other bitter concocted elixirs or potions he ever drank. Although not much, Shira could feel his body warming up. He was surprised at the unexpected reaction.</p>\n<p>“Oohhhh!!!” Monkey cried as his eyes glued at Shira’s Status Window. “The EXP bar moved!”</p>\n<p>“What?” the surprised Shira glanced at Snake and asked slowly, “This one’s free, right?”</p>\n<p>It was in a single flash Shira did catch a strange dumbfoundedness in Snake eyes, like the result even came more shocking than him than either of Shira and Monkey. Yet the moment after he promptly regained his stoic exposure, then said to Shira, “Don’t worry, I don’t plan to take back my words,”</p>\n<p>The odd Alchemist put his hands at his back and walked back to his wagon. Before he climbed the wagon, he once again glanced at Shira, looking in a state of half-disbelief like expression</p>\n<p>As Snake disappeared into the wagon, Shira and Monkey exchanged glances.</p>\n<p>“He still has that kind of face even though he promises it to be free? You sure do have an odd friend.” Shira said.</p>\n<p>Monkey grinned. “Though an oddball, I never seen anyone with more talent in alchemy than him, like, ever.”</p>\n<p>After leaving Monkey to continue his stall, Shira saw Good-Natured Spirit again when he visited a food stall not far from Monkey’s wagon. He asked what he was doing, and the Nalaq told him there was a fool who bet a lot and won a lot in the gambling games. To lose against in gambling against someone with Good-Natured Spirit’s caliber, really--Shira sighed--he couldn’t wait for his coming-of-age ceremony next year so he too could farm on these gullible people in some friendly matches--just like what he did with Good-Natured Spirit for this past one year.</p>\n<p>“You know,” munching on some satays he bought from the market, Shira muttered when he headed home along with Good-Natured Spirit, “just then I drank this elixir that really could boost my EXP a little. I don’t know how the guy concocts it, but I have the feeling that I just drink some very expensive elixir for free.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, yeah?”</p>\n<p>On the way back to Yashura Family Shira told the Nalaq spirit about the Alchemist and his elixirs. He also told him that his status that usually wouldn’t react to normal elixirs this time moved a bit after he drank a strange low-quality elixir.</p>\n<p>“That Alchemist must be a nerd to be that sharp,” Good-Natured Spirit said as he floated lazily beside the boy.</p>\n<p>“He looks like that too. The peddler he partnered with also has some good sense in him. So I thought it’s not a loss for me to use all those foreign coins I got from you to invest on them for the next year.”</p>\n<p>“Hmm,” Good-Natured Spirit crossed his arms. “I think you should be worried.”</p>\n<p>“Worried? Why?”</p>\n<p>“You said that nerd Alchemist was the one who pushed that low-quality elixir to you, right?”</p>\n<p>“I got to drink that for free,” Shira emphasized.</p>\n<p>“He realized one little secret about you then,” Good-Natured Spirit said.</p>\n<p>Shira stopped walking. He looked at him with his head tilted.</p>\n<p>“What secret?”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit who floated before, spoke again.</p>\n<p>“You shouldn’t worry about it too much for now, brat. But, I advise you, if you are still holding dear for your lazy, peaceful village life, you should turn back and kill him right now.”</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-3/chapter-3-5":"<p>What the Nalaq told Shira lingered in his mind. Good-Natured Spirit blurted something about killing someone as if it was something trivial that could popped out easily in normal conversation. To kill someone after finding out his secret--what kind of secret he needed to protect anyway? A secret he never wanted people to know the fact he was drawing semi-porns for money. But he wasn’t that insecure to kill someone over a petty secret like that? That would be him being not right in the head. The more he thought about Good-Natured Spirit’s remark, the more it disturbed him. Especially right now, when his hands painted in red, bathed in blood. When he just did an act of actual killing.</p>\n<p>“Something on your mind, Young Master Shira?” a rough voice disturbed his train of thought.</p>\n<p>“Ah,” Shira looked at a burly man, an experienced hunter, who called him.</p>\n<p>The man’s body even drenched in thicker blood than him. One would get easily nauseated by the sight of it. Yet it didn’t make the boy flinched, as he was expecting the experience for a few months already.</p>\n<p>“Here. Look at his gut. Spilling out his innards with your own hands might be a good experience for you, young master.”</p>\n<p>The hunter spun a sharp dagger, holding it by the tip of its blade, having a gesture of offering it to his young master.</p>\n<p>“Is that okay? I even had trouble when skinning the hide,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>He’d rather not, to be honest, since splitting a goat’s gut could be messy if he did it crudely. Even if he was the young master of the family, when messing with the raw meat, not even his uncle could save him from the aunties’ nagging. Shira Yashura was nearly sixteen, almost reaching adulthood, so he had to participate in butchering goats; it was a quite tasking task, but was easy enough compared to butchering cows he had to do in a few years. But for the fifteen years old young master, getting the hang of the butchering knife’s handle was plenty of experience already for him.</p>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>As the custom dictates, every month in ngajen ceremony preparation, the boys will have to deal with cows and goats while the girls help aunties plucking chickens’ and ducks’ feathers. Whether the gatekeepers' children or the family’s next heirs, all of them are required to do it every time a major ceremony approaches.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>After doing his part in butchering a goat Shira immediately took a bath to remove the bloody pungent. On a whim he then strolled to the kitchen to grab some snacks. There he witnessed how all the coconuts he and his uncle shred already transformed into delicious foods; rendang, Bulayak satay, coconut satay, spicy curry, many other mouth drolling coconut cuisines. The coconut loving uncle was all smiles and gave him a big portion of the famous beef cuisine the locals called rendang--which, normally, even for a young master like Shira would get to eat rendang once every few months. But with enough wit and experience in currying favor with his uncle, he got to taste those delicious food handed down by his uncle, the Chief Chef, personally.</p>\n<p>“Shira my boy,” Patriarch Shuro said to his nephew who was squatting below the shadow of a thick pillar, happily munching on his rendang, “you’re going to visit Malikh Family tonight. Keep a good check on your cousin. Don’t embarrass Yashura Family and present our rendang_ _for their main family.”</p>\n<p>“Sure.”</p>\n<hr>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>Domesticated cows were less in numbers than goats in Badril Village, so meals from cows, not including the innards which could be made into popular but cheap cuisines, like only served for village big shots or important visitors during the ngajen ceremony.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>Laughters and chatters made the night more merry than any other thay of the month. It was brighter than usual, as villagers came out of their house to set up big braziers to light the road between the families that were holding festives. From one hundred meters away, through the thick wall of the big families, the mouth-watering aroma of prepared food wafted through the air as if they informally invited people to come and to taste the delicacy these big families had. The change in scenery upon the arrival of the night signaled the nigh of Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>Yashura Family, the oldest family around, was known to have the best food amongst all families in Badril Village, while Elzhier Family known as the family that always threw the biggest party post-ceremony--Elzhier Family’s maidservants were beautiful and they’d show off their voluptuous bodies every single ngajen ceremony. Particularly this month however, everyone was anticipating the ceremony thrown by Malikh Family; for two years since the young lady’s absence they threw nothing more than mediocre festivities, her return was to be seen as their revival on the village’s political stage. And from how big their arrangement looked like, it seemed Malikh Family didn’t plan to fail everyone’s expectations.</p>\n<p>Shira Yashura wore the same suit he got from his uncle on his fifteenth birthday. It was the usual suit he’d wear whenever a ceremony was held. His uncle bought it from a merchant who had connections outside the kingdom, which was pretty good since the fabric wasn’t stiff, but could get unbearably itchy in places he didn’t want to scratch whenever there were people around. The obvious part missing from the wears his peers were wearing was beast pelts.</p>\n<p>Pelts from ferocious beasts were known for irrefutable proof for boys’ courage and manliness. As many young gentlemen of Badril Village wore on their necks, always looking for the opportunity to show off the trophy of their preys to girls--which translated as fashionable fads for boys who wanted to get laids.</p>\n<p>Of course, Shira, as part of the dull and no-nonsense camp of the boys in Badril Village, never had participated in that kind of indecent business. He was so dull that the only girl who would accompany him to attend ceremonies was his cousin Mila--who, even though her face was quite pretty, also happened to be in terrible luck for romance.</p>\n<p>“No matter how many times I see it, it’s always impressive to see how fast you wrap all these banana leaves,” Shira commented as he watched how Mila wrapped rendang with banana leaves. She was very good at it, comparable to the aunties’ skills that had been forged day and night in the family’s kitchen.</p>\n<p>“You talking? You’ve done your training with the family's sword technique, I assume?” Mila said with her lips pouted. Shira thought it was unusual for Mila didn’t nag her mouth off immediately when she saw him. He saw a sword wrapped in cloth near Mila. His face immediately twisted in a troubled look.</p>\n<p>“I won’t bring that thing,” he protested.</p>\n<p>“You--” Mila hissed.</p>\n<p>“What should I do with a sword inside another family’s ceremony?” Shira said. The sword was his father’s, and that was his reason he didn’t want to use it. “Look, I can only draw the blade from the sheath at most. Without a proper amount of Strength attribute I can’t swing this properly. It rejects my mana. I’d make a fool out of myself if that happened.”</p>\n<p>“That’s because you were stupidly increasing your Wisdom instead of, that’s why you--arghh! Just forget about it! I know you’re trying to make excuses! Since you’re so weak all we can do is flaunting around your father’s reputation. We’ve got to remind people that our Yashura Family’s not to mess with. Here, just slip this fucking sword in your belt.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, this is embarrassing. Those rumors are about to get worse tonight,” Shira said with a sigh. His reputation as a trash talent was annoying enough, added this shameless act of throwing his weight around, he’d become more reluctant to show his face in the public later on. But still he unwillingly slipped the sword in his belt.</p>\n<p>Mila snorted. She ignored the complaint. Right now she could care less about the rumors about her cousin. What she had to prioritize tonight was the bad premonition she had about Bhela Malikh’s short hair--nobody believed her when she said that Bhela was being a slut for cutting her hair short in spite of her being in an engagement. While her hands craftly knotted the rendang wrapped in banana leaves with a rope made with dried coconut leaves, she suddenly had a cold smile; the image of those impudent Malikhs shuddering under the famous sword of Yashura Family’s Unique Class, Jhuro Yashura the Blackfang Swordsman, entertained her she began to chuckle coldly.</p>\n<p>“Huhuhu… just you wait you bitch…”</p>\n<p>Shira stepped back. He had the hunch he should keep a distance away from his current cousin right now.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Every month, for every family in Badril Village, cooking during the Ngajen Ceremony was always a time rushing hectic. Even more in Malikh Family this time. Since the amount of food they had to deliver before the ceremony started more than twice the amount they made last month, most of the aunties in duty were cooking outdoors. The smoke from the half-dried firewood would be too unbearable for the eyes if all of them cooked in one cramped place. Fortunately, most of the dishes were already cooked and sent to the courtyard, so the only people who were still on duty preparing food were a small number of aunties and maidservants.</p>\n<p>The young maidservants were pale from tiredness but they couldn’t afford to slack in this one Ngajen Ceremony. The usual noisy aunties, they didn’t even show a sign of wanting to rest. Nobody could beat the resilience of the kitchen-duty armies when it came to preparing for a loadful of party’s foods.</p>\n<p>Usually, the one who would supervise these spartan cooking aunties would be the patriarch’s wife, Bhela’s mother. It was already a long-held tradition in the village for the patriarch to cook for the family’s important guests as the Chief Chef, while the wife supported him by supervising the aunties and maidservants. In Ngajen Ceremony this month, however, Bhela’s mother holed herself to accompany the husband on his ill-bed.</p>\n<p>She was not in the mood to meet with people. So Bhela stepped in to fill her position.</p>\n<p>Back when she was little Bhela often followed her mother working during the ngajen ceremony, she knew what she had to do by the back of her hand. In usage of salt, for example, she knew down to the tiniest detail of how much salt should be applied to different kinds of cuisines. She also instructed the inexperienced maidservants who were in charge of cooking side dishes so the overall quality of the feast would be balanced. Bhela Malikh didn’t betray everyone’s expectations about her. She did her work splendidly.</p>\n<p>However, there was a matter she saw that didn’t make her happy. The largest furnace that was usually reserved for the Chief Chef, today was used by an old man from the outer family. A great cook, the old man was. Known for his vast experience in handling the family’s food stalls for years. The problem was his common status. Without at least an elder status made it awkward for him to cook as the Chief Chef in this kitchen, even if he was a mere proxy. Bhela wondered whether the one who took the charge when her parents were unavailable knew the risk of being laughed at and criticized by the other two big families--especially now that the relationship between Yashura and Malikh wasn’t that good like before.</p>\n<p>“Young lady, the day’s getting dark, you should take a bath now and prepare yourself for the ceremony,” an aunty said to Bhela.</p>\n<p>“Yes, young lady is no longer a little girl, so making you pretty will take a while,” an early twenty maidservant added from the side. She continued, “The new girls should be able to complete the foods since you directed them a lot. Please don’t worry about us.”</p>\n<p>“I’m relieved to hear that,” Bhela said. Not yet three seconds later her eyes wandered to the old cook again. She couldn’t hide her frown.</p>\n<p>“Something the matter, Young Lady Bhela?”</p>\n<p>“Yes. Maybe it’s a misunderstanding on my part but… I can’t see the elder who would substitute my father as the Chief Chef.”</p>\n<p>Hearing Bhela said her concern, the aunties and the maidservants averted eyes with their young lady with troubled faces. Bhela then understood there was something shady going on.</p>\n<p>Her suspicion turned worse when she saw a young man in his twenties leading four manservants with him. When the aunties were working in the kitchen, it was an unspoken rule for unrelated adult men not to approach, but the battle-hardened aunties that normally were ferocious in defending their territories were all silent in welcoming the cocky visitors. It wasn’t surprising to Bhela that all of them came from Elder Jhamil’s faction.</p>\n<p>“Why aren’t you ready yet, old worm?!”</p>\n<p>“I am sorry, young elder… some dish cannot be rushed so I prepared some to--”</p>\n<p><em>Slap!!</em></p>\n<p>The slapping sound echoed in the kitchen. The room descended into a dead silent. The old cook was trembling; he lowered his head and covered the cheek that just got slapped but everyone could see the blood on the corner of his mouth. Bhela recollected her memory, and finally remembered the arrogant young man was actually Elder Jhamil’s own son.</p>\n<p>“Shit!” Elder Jhamil’s son swore, “those councils from Village Hall came. We must complete the set before too long! Those people are the ones who usually have the heaviest voice when valuing Ngajen Ceremony dishes!”</p>\n<p>One follower quipped, “Young elder is right. This old worm can’t cook shit! If this goes on, the only things the Village Hall council will remember about Elder Jhamil’s cooking is that we Malikhs cook as slow as snail!”</p>\n<p>The frown on Bhela’s face became deeper. Young elder? Before she went out for the seminars that lasted two years, this man, son of Elder Jhamil, merely a family member with a post within the family’s business. And something else that disturbed her was how she couldn’t see how the blurted about Elder Jhamil’s cooking, the one who worked in the kitchen all day, didn’t see the said elder even once today.</p>\n<p>Bhela still held her silent. But her eyes were cold and sharp judging people and the situation. The aunties and the maidservants, though they looked sympathetic with the old man, were afraid to go against Elder Jhamil’s son. Maybe because the lack of resistance Elder Jhamil’s son dared to do a taboo known in the kitchen--swapping food that wrapped in banana leaves with ceramic plates, garnished a bit, and called it the Chief Chef’s cuisine.</p>\n<p>“No, young elder!” a brave middle-aged aunty stepped forward, “you can’t do that!”</p>\n<p>“Why not?” one follower sneered in Elder Jhamil’s son’s place. “This one also got beef, isn’t it? We need to quickly serve the Chief Chef cuisine to the people from Village Hall councils.”</p>\n<p>“Exactly because they are from the Village Hall council--just from inferior cuts of the beef they’d know the dishes have been swapped! You’ll tarnish Malikh Family’s honor if people knew you were fooling--”</p>\n<p>“Fooling?!” Elder Jhamil roared.</p>\n<p>The young elder raised his hand, though the aunty who complained quickly hid back behind the maidservants. Elder Jhamil’s son then rampaged into a series of barking, yelling and threatening the aunties to cut their salary just because his mood was spoiled.</p>\n<p>His words scared all the girls and the women inside the kitchen. All except Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>After they were done swapping the foods, the young elder led his men out of the kitchen with great swagger. The young elder stopped at the door, turned around, and gave the old cook one last ultimatum: “There’ll be a noble in the ceremony so we need rendang for the main course. So go make it, old worm. You know what’s gonna happen if you couldn’t deliver, don’t you?”</p>\n<p>The old man trembled. Even the eyes on the aunties couldn’t help but shake at the threat. There was now way they could prepare rendang with only two hours remaining until the Ngajen Ceremony started.</p>\n<p>After that situation calmed down. The aunties and the maidservants went back to work. Some of them still exchanged whispered and gossiped amongst themselves. But when Bhela approached, immediately they stopped and pretended nothing happened.</p>\n<p>“Young lady…” a pudgy aunty came to her, the one who stood up against the young elder from before.</p>\n<p>“Aunty?”</p>\n<p>“We are sorry… we’ve had no meaning to show you that embarrassing scene.”</p>\n<p>Bhela shook her head. “No, I’m one from the main family bloodline; I should've been the one who stood up to him instead of hiding behind everyone.”</p>\n<p>The aunty knew the young lady didn’t say a word before because the girl wanted to know the situation. Some other middle-aged aunties who were close with Madam Malikh also knew more or less Bhela’s detached wait-and-see attitude, so no one really would blame her even if she didn’t say a word before--especially since she had just returned from overseas. The pudgy aunty tugged on Bhela’s sleeve, whispered to her ear, “Young Lady Bhela, we know you’re concerned. But we’ve already gotten used to it. You’re still young. Your future is brighter than everyone else in the family, Young Lady Bhela. It’s better to endure than pointlessly making enemies.”</p>\n<p>“This isn’t pointless,” Bhela said. She then grabbed the nearest apron and wore it. Her father was the patriarch. And she wasn’t a poster girl to draw everyone’s attention to the family.</p>\n<p>The pudgy aunty wanted to say something again. But words stuck on her throat, she closed her mouth as soon as she opened it.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the old man began to pick some mature coconut and shredded it listlessly. He got more than four decades of handling food stalls for Malikh Family, he wasn’t a stranger at cooking rendang. But he already gave up on finishing one for tonight’s Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>“Uncle, I’ll take it from here,” Bhela said as she approached the weary old man.</p>\n<p>“Ahh, yes?” the old man was started. The girl came with an apron and common garment, had fair and beautiful skin, as well clear and articulate voice; a maidservant from the inner family was the first one that came to his mind. But only when he noticed even the aunties were respectful to her and her striking bob-cut short hair that the old man began drenched in cold sweat.</p>\n<p>“I said, uncle,” Bhela repeated, “I’ll take it from here. You can rest now.”</p>\n<p>The old man vigorously shook his head.</p>\n<p>“Please Young Lady Bhela… please spare this old bone….”</p>\n<p>“This is originally my father’s post, uncle. You’ll have to be at least an elder and write your name in council’s ledger to be a substitute for my father.”</p>\n<p>The old man wanted to break into a tearless cry. This is worse than when he faced Elder Jhamil’s son's harassment before. The most thing he was afraid of was the news of Elder Jhamil using him as Chief Chef behind the scene to reach the ears of the main family. And now that Bhela Malikh was here, there was nothing he could do but to resign his life to fate.</p>\n<p>“Y-young lady!” a maidservant yelled, “you can’t!”</p>\n<p>“Who says I can’t?” Bhela asked sharply.</p>\n<p>An aunty, who had a stern-looking face, said, “You can’t cook for the main course, young lady. In case of a patriarch's absence, usually one of the elders who’s going to take his place. There’s no rule saying it’s okay for women to do it.”</p>\n<p>“Then, I’m going to ask,” from the aunty, Bhela threw her glance toward the old man, “are you an elder cooking here to substitute my father as a cook, uncle?”</p>\n<p>The old man’s face turned pale. Whichever the answer of that question would lead him to the road of punishment. All of the sudden, he became a mute.</p>\n<p>Because she had the most standing, nobody made a sound when Young Lady Bhela Malikh asked them to fetch chickens and spices for her.</p>\n<p>Not long after, the story about how the Young Lady of Malikh Family wanted to substitute her father spread like a wildfire. Never in Badril Village’s history would a young lady do that. A crowd of curious males, mostly the youngsters from main and outer of Malikh Family, surrounded the kitchen as they wanted to catch a glimpse of how their beautiful young lady recklessly challenged the custom by her own. The boys sighed in admiration. Bhela Malikh was essentially an Archer at heart. But the way she handled a blade, even if it was a kitchen knife, was skillful and graceful, as every time her slim wrist stopped moving from cutting down a vegetable, a wave of gulping could be heard. The boys couldn’t take their eyes from her. The reckless and brave young lady was simply too charming.</p>\n<p>“Did you know that foreigners often confuse rendang as dried curry?” Bhela said to one maidservant who stared at the way she cooked. “Curry leaves originated from an area close to western Haldeen lands, so many local Mossacks sailed the sea to try their luck making it big working for western empires.”</p>\n<p>The usual aloof Bhela unusually was talkative when she was cooking, which was quite a big surprise for people who were watching. She explained to the clueless maidservants how, during her two years travelling in seminars from countries to countries, found many noble owned restaurants claimed to serve rendang but turned out to be dried curry. All the while sharply focused on doing her cooking duty.</p>\n<p>“Young lady!” from the crowd came out an angry bald man. He was Elder Jhamil. “W-what are you doing there?”</p>\n<p>“I’m cooking,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“But you can’t work there!” Elder Jhamil yelled. “No woman can substitute for patriarch! That’s against the rule!”</p>\n<p>“I don’t recall we have a rule like that.”</p>\n<p>“If you know why you still stand there?”</p>\n<p>“Neither do I recall a rule for an elder to use a stand-in for the Chief Chef position.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s face turned weird as if he suddenly got constipated. Many of the youngsters didn’t catch Bhela’s remarks nor they cared too much about it, but some in the crowd were nodding knowingly, as many of them were familiar with how shady Elder Jhamil was doing things.</p>\n<p>As the bald elder’s head was racing fast looking for an answer to defuse the young lady’s claim, suddenly, a loud roar exploded behind him.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela, who do you think you are? Just because your father is the family’s patriarch you think you can do whatever you want?!”</p>\n<p>The faces of aunties and the maidservants twitched. They witnessed how the young elder harassed the old man before, so they were itching to throw back the same question at him instead, though no more brave aunties dared to cause more troubles.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s son continued, “The ingredient for making Chief dishes takes money, young lady. Not even the patriarch himself has the daring to use coins from the treasury for himself. Do you want to embarrass your parents that much?”</p>\n<p>“I’m not making this food for myself nor I cook for my father. It’s for the guests. And I provided the spices and the foreign curry leaves by myself,” Bhela said. Some maidservants behind her nodded nervously as Bhela indeed ordered them to fetch spices from the personal kitchen in the main family’s residential area.</p>\n<p>In spite of that, the young elder kept pushing on with nasty smile on his face.</p>\n<p>“What about the chicken, young lady? They cost money! What do you say about that, huh?”</p>\n<p>Behind Bhela, the aunties, even the maidservants, were whispering at each other on how ridiculous it was to question the sole young generation of Malikh Family main bloodline over some chickens. Even Bhela, the young lady in question, would only glanced at the troubled expression of Elder Jhamil.</p>\n<p>“I will pay for the chicken,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Ha? Pay? With what? Your father’s money? Can’t a sick person even pay the cost of the foods for ngajen ceremony all by himself?”</p>\n<p>“No need to bring my father’s name here.” Bhela said with a dangerously cold tone.</p>\n<p>The chillness in her eyes was telling that she really did hate people bringing her parents’ name in bad faith. After hearing gasps of surprise from people that didn’t expect the usually silent young lady could utter something with such a biting tone, she sighed, said with an explanation, “I got a dress as a gift from a certain person who has too much money in his pocket. He said the dress is so valuable even the princesses wear them in parties. It should cover the cost of these chickens I’m going to cook if I sell the dress right here right now.”</p>\n<p>Bhela then tilted her head and glanced at the bald elder.</p>\n<p>“Am I right, Elder Jhamil?”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil wanted to maintain his smile, but his face went stiff as stone. He was trembling inside for knowing that the dress he acquired with a large sum of money and with his best connection, valued the same as some mere village chickens in Bhela’s eyes.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, his son, who was taken aback for a bit from the cold remark Bhela had said earlier, recovered, began to yell again, “Ha! Did you not train your brain when you were overseas, my young lady? The same dress princesses wear in parties? Only someone dumb believe that! Hah! Obviously you’ve been lied to! You’ve been crooked, young lady, crooked--”</p>\n<p><em>Paak!</em></p>\n<p>From behind, the already red-faced Elder Jhamil smacked his son’s head. “You’ve been rude to Young Lady Bhela, you dumbskull! You have to apologize! Young lady can’t bear to hear it anymore!”</p>\n<p>While in fact it was him who couldn’t bear to hear being called a crook.</p>\n<p>“Apologize!” Elder Jhamil roared.</p>\n<p><em>Splash!</em></p>\n<p>The pair father and son’s performance didn’t amuse Bhela, however. With the lid in her hand, Bhela scooped boiling curry broth and splashed it to their direction. Surprised, the stupid young elder swore with nasty words while his father cried in high-pitched voice.</p>\n<p>“Please get out,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil laughed wryly.</p>\n<p>“Please don’t be like that, young lady. I know my son doesn't have the best education but--”</p>\n<p><em>Splash!!</em></p>\n<p>Bhela waved the cooking lid once again as soon as Elder Jhamil stepped forward. The hot water splashed on his expensive boots. This time, while he didn’t expect for Bhela splashing hot water at him again, he wasn’t freaking out. It seemed his plan to make the young lady behave a little backfiring instead. His face turned solemn.</p>\n<p>“Young lady…”</p>\n<p>“I’m not going to say it thrice--everyone who has nothing to do in the kitchen, please get out,” Bhela said. “Or else--”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The major families’ lands were astonishingly spacious and complex, their walls were thick and tall, therefore each of them employed a few stationary guards for the main gate as gatekeepers. These gatekeepers, though usually filled by members of the outer part of the families, their duty were significantly more important than others since they represented the face of the family they served. So they always maintain polite gestures to everyone who came through their gate, either commoners or rich people from big families. Yet when Shira and Mila arrived the Malikh Family’s gatekeepers didn’t even hide their scoffs.</p>\n<p>“Ridiculous!” she hissed with a face boiled in anger, “even lowly gatekeepers are looking down on us!”</p>\n<p>“Don’t bother with them,” Shira said. Unlike his cousin’s furious temper, his flair seemed like he shrugged the blatant disrespect, as the holder of “Eternal Novice” title he was already numb by how people were talking behind his back.</p>\n<p>“If your father was here they’d bow their asses as soon as they saw us Yashura coming.”</p>\n<p>Shira shrugged his shoulders again.</p>\n<p>Still seething in anger, Mila cast her eyes on the banana leaves wrapped food in Shira’s hands. “Who should we give the rendang to?” she asked.</p>\n<p>“Let’s just give it to a random servant.” Then Shira called a maidservant who was carrying a tray full of food. “Excuse me!”</p>\n<p>“Yes? What can I help y--” The moment this maidservant turned her head and saw Shira’s face, she immediately threw back her eyes and escaped with hurried trot, pretending she saw nothing.</p>\n<p>“The fuck?!” Mila was flastergabbed, didn’t know what to say.</p>\n<p>Later on Shira and Mila realized how unpopular Yashura Family was to the current Malikhs, even the servants who usually held no voice in the family were avoiding the pair of cousins like plague. Their attitude especially worsened when it came to Shira Yashura.</p>\n<p>“Look there,” someone whispered amongst the guests, “Yashura Family send their eldest young miss and the young master! Out of all the Ngajen Ceremony, they choose tonight to show their faces--pretty obvious, eh? Bet they’re drooling to get another Unique Class after knowing our Young Lady Bhela’s real talent tonight!”</p>\n<p>Someone else agreed and replied, “With that kind of trash as their young master, they’d be dreamin’ to get even a touch of our Young Lady Bhela. Pueh!”</p>\n<p>Hearing the muffled disdain, Mila Yashura whirled her body, glaring people with eagle eyes. “Who said that?!” she growled.</p>\n<p>“Mila…” Shira held her shoulder.</p>\n<p>“The fuckers don’t even put our Yashura Family in their eyes. Just because shitty rumors about Unique Class they started to feel high and mighty, eh?”</p>\n<p>“Just let go, Uncle Shuro didn’t send us here to start troubles,” Shira said. “All we need to do is to show our faces here and give them our rendang. It’s not our problem whether they welcome our good intention with grace or not.”</p>\n<p>Though Shira said that, he secretly hoped Malikh Family would grow too proud to receive it--all so he had an excuse to keep his uncle’s rendang for himself.</p>\n<p>A commotion arose. People hussing here and there with excitement. When Shira and Mila wanted to know what was going on, a parade of beautiful young women glittering and stealing the whole show came from inside of Malikh Family’s hall. Leading them was a short-haired young beauty, face as icy as an ice sculpture, the recent name that everyone had been talking about these days, Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>It was clear from the way Bhela positioned herself she represented the family as the ceremony’s Chief Chef.</p>\n<p>“Whoa, so Malikh Family let her do that,” Shira murmured.</p>\n<p>Not to mention being the Chief Chef--the most Shira did in his family’s kitchen was helping his uncle, helping him shred coconuts. They were at the same age, but the same old Shira still practiced butchering goats while the supposed fiancée of his was climbing the social ladder. Even Mila was angry by the special treatment Malikh Family gave to their young lady.</p>\n<p>“Sup, young master!” from behind a voice called him.</p>\n<p>Shira turned around, found the one who greeted him was Monkey.</p>\n<p>“Who?” Mila asked Shira as the stranger with a monkey-like face approaching.</p>\n<p>“This one is called by the name of Monkey, young lady,” Monkey, with his self-trained Mossack’s style bowing gesture, introduced himself smoothly.</p>\n<p>Mila hummed in ackwnoledgement. It was harder to forget than remembering someone with such combination of face and awkward name.</p>\n<p>“Mister Monkey, I thought you’ll spend the ceremony to show Mister Snake around since he’s an outsider. What are you doing in Malikh Family?” Shira asked.</p>\n<p>“Now, now, please drop the ‘Mister’, young master. I’m not that old yet to be called as such,” Monkey said, then he continued explaining his story this evening. “We were planning to go to your family’s ceremony, young master. But who would have thought Snake to meet with his relatives here? His relatives are actually Malikh Family’s guests for tonight’s Ngajen Ceremony. Bet he got to eat expensive cuisines right now.”</p>\n<p>“Well, it’ll be easier with Mister Snake here. I’ve got some coins I want to show you, I wonder if it works to use them for--” Shira sneakily glanced at his cousin, then turned back to Monkey like it was nothing, “--for the thing we talked about yesterday.”</p>\n<p>Mila sneered, “You have some business to attend, no?”</p>\n<p>“Not really, no,” Shira shrugged off her question.</p>\n<p>“Really, though?” Mila crossed her arms, sneered again. “I think I saw Romana just now. I’mma chat with her a little bit.”</p>\n<p>It seemed to Shira that his cousin meeting with Romana here, in Malikh Family’s Ngajen Ceremony, wasn’t simply to have fun. He didn’t like his cousin would make trouble but he didn’t want to spend the whole night with her either. “Don’t go home without me,” he said eventually.</p>\n<p>“Hmph! You’re not a kid anymore but still need me to accompany you home?”</p>\n<p>No, Shira actually was more worried about her than himself.</p>\n<p>He then glanced beside and said, “Mister Monkey.”</p>\n<p>“Just Monkey,” Monkey corrected.</p>\n<p>“Mister Just Monkey, you said Mister Snake with relative? And his relatives are Malikh Family’s guests?”</p>\n<p>“Not Just Mon--ah, forget about it,” Monkey already gave up guessing whether Young Master Shira Yashura was purposely pulling his leg or not. “They really were Malikh Family’s guests, they even got the front row for the prayer and all.”</p>\n<p>“Is hard for us to be friendly if Mister Snake is involved with Malikh Family.”</p>\n<p>“You mean, that, huh? Well, I’ve been here for a while and they talked about you a lot, so I guess even someone as chill as you can get angry sometimes. But you don’t have to worry about those Malikhs, Young Master Shira. As long as their patriarch is Ghalim Malikh they won’t sever ties with Yashura so easily.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, is this your opinion?”</p>\n<p>“It’s Snake’s. It’s what he said before he met his relatives.”</p>\n<p>Shira thought the Alchemist he met once before was a total stranger of Badril Village, but it appeared he was wrong. “He really does know about Malikh Family that much, doesn’t he?”</p>\n<p>“Well, yeah, but I think he’s more familiar with Yashura than Malikh Family, though,” Monkey said, crossing his arms and nodded to himself as he recalled things that Snake told him to get his wares supported by Yashura Family; for example, obtaining Butler Yulong’s permission the same as Patriarch Shuro Yashura’s, Snake once said.</p>\n<p>“What? Why do you make that kind of face, Young Master Shira?” Monkey was snapped from his train of thought.</p>\n<p>“Ah, no, I just don’t expect you’re going to say some like that.”</p>\n<p>“What are you saying, young master. In the first place, Snake became my crew because he heard I’ve some dealing with Yashura Family.”</p>\n<p>Shira did recall the first time Monkey contacted Yashura Family--through him. To be more exact, the first item Monkey dealt from Malikh Family was Shira’s smuggled erotic painting that Good-Natured Spirit rejected.</p>\n<p>“--Speaking of Snake,” with his thumb Monkey did point in a certain direction. The place was separated from the common guest as they indeed were Malikh Family’s special guests. Shira’s eyes followed and he saw the familiar Alchemist he knew not long ago, Snake, was talking with two men, young and old, most likely brother and his grandfather.</p>\n<p>“Don’t be fooled by their appearances, young master. They’re renowned experts,” Monkey said.</p>\n<p>The pair of brother and grandfather wore worn out pale robes as their clothes, unlike the image of revered experts in Shira’s mind. Monkey told him both likely to travel incognito for various reasons. The old man had an old white hair and long beard, his back crooked and had to bring a walking staff to support himself, and gave people the impression of a sleepy grandpa from the dim light on his eyes. The young one though, had an always angry-looking face with fierce brows, crossing his muscle-thick arms, locked in a debate with Snake. Snake’s face was notably paler than when Shira met him in the market.</p>\n<p>“We can’t greet Mister Snake now, can we?” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think we can,” Monkey said. Even though he long considered Snake as his partner, the two guests appearing incognito were still the main members of the revered Alchemist family. This was no time for commoners like him acting friendly on them all of the sudden.</p>\n<p>The sleepy-looking old man, noticing two pairs of eyes looking at him, he raised his head. He caught the sight of Shira. Their eyes met.</p>\n<p>“Oh ho,” the old man smiled when he found the boy. He dragged his old body to approach the flastergabbed Shira and Monkey.</p>\n<p>Even Monkey who knew more about them wouldn’t expect Snake’s relatives to introduce themselves first.</p>\n<p>“He’s heading this way…”</p>\n<p>“Ah, yes, apparently.”</p>\n<p>Monkey gulped. “It’s different with Snake. Although he looked like that, whatever you do, please, young master, you can’t afford to be rude in front of this elder…”</p>\n<p>From the nervousness in Monkey’s voice Shira found the approaching old man seemed to hail from a more prestigious family than he originally thought.</p>\n<p>“Greeting, elder,” Shira said with his head humbly lowered as soon as he approached.</p>\n<p>The old man chuckled, patted Shira’s head, said, “Ah, Young Master, look how much you’ve grown. It feels like only yesterday how happy you were running around like a little kid you are.”</p>\n<p>Shira nodded hearing that. He glanced beside him, and caught Monkey’s face flabbergasted looking both at the boy and the old man.</p>\n<p>Hiding his embarrassment behind a fake cough, Shira then tried to understand whether the old man mistook him for someone else. “I’m sorry, elder. I don’t know if I’m mistaken, but, have we met before?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, have we met? Of course we’ve--” he stopped. The old man's eyes were covered by a pair of soft hands of a girl.</p>\n<p>“Guess who this is?” the girl who sneakily teased the old man from behind was grinning.</p>\n<p>“Oho! Who is this? Who is this?” the old man smiled delightedly.</p>\n<p>Both Shira and Monkey were tense watching the scene before them. Especially Shira Yashura, who knew that the grin on his cousin’s face always told that the girl enjoyed herself a little bit too much.</p>\n<p>“Isn’t this… Tomboy Princess?” the old man guessed.</p>\n<p>“Tuut! Wrong!”</p>\n<p>Mila released her hands. When the old man turned to see the preparator, he exclaimed with a chuckle.</p>\n<p>“It’s really you, Tomboy Princess.”</p>\n<p>Mila excitedly echoed, “It’s really you, Grandpa Piss!”</p>\n<p>They were so glad they met after a long time that they started to hug each other. Then Mila pull herself from the oldman’s embrace, yelling, “Ugghh…” she pinched her nose, “I smell something pissy around here.”</p>\n<p>Just when Shira and Monkey wondered what Mila meant by that, the girl looked at the old man, saying, “It’s no wonder it smells pissy. Have you taken a bath, Grandpa Piss.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss answered with a laugh. But Shira and Monkey facepalmed.</p>\n<p>So much for being mindful in front of the revered old expert.</p>\n<p>Shira awkwardly smiled to cover his shame. “Mila, you should be mindful in front of elders.”</p>\n<p>“Mindful?” Mila gasped. “In front of Grandpa Piss? Why?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, it’s okay, young master,” the old man said as he waved his hand. “I’m not that old to lose my sense of humor. Yashura Family’s princess sure is as naughty as always.” His wrinkles deepened as he curled his lips into a big smile. He said to Mila, “I reckon Patriarch Shuro’s been well, my princess? I recall he got a lot of migraines back in the day.”</p>\n<p>Haughtily, Mila replied, “Don’t worry about that guy, Grandpa Piss. His brain capacity has been declining these past years so there’s really nothing left inside to give him any headache!”</p>\n<p>“Ehem,” Shira cleared his phlegm. “She meant our patriarch has been well, elder.”</p>\n<p>“That’s what I said,” Mila laughed, and the old man laughed too. After that Mila kissed Grandpa Piss’s right hand as if she was kissing an elder’s hand from her own family, then continued laughing as cheeky as always.</p>\n<p>“My naughty princess,” Grandpa Piss ruffled Mila’s hair, “I planned to visit Yashura Family later. But since we’ve already met, here, please take this.”</p>\n<p>Receiving a pack wrapped in dried leaves, Mila pouted her lips. “You wouldn’t be lying about this being a candy again, would you?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, of course not.”</p>\n<p>As far as her memory served her well, what Grandpa Piss called candy actually a really bitter herb for young children to gain their appetite. Mila sniffed. She opened it and have a little taste. “Uuueeekk!”</p>\n<p>It was sour and even more bitter than she remembered. “What the hell is this?!”</p>\n<p>“That herb’s not for consumption, Young Lady Mila” the big man with muscles, Snake’s big brother, said from behind Grandpa Piss. He was smiling politely despite the other party merely a young lady of a rural village. “It’s a cosmetic for skin care.”</p>\n<p>“Skin care?!”</p>\n<p>Mila’s mouth widened agape. But soon as she glanced at the muscle man who was approaching her, she became wary, leaned to Grandpa Piss and whispered, “Grandpa Piss, who’s that?”</p>\n<p>With a patient smile replied, Grandpa Piss said, “He’s Snotty. Don’t you remember Snotty?”</p>\n<p>Mila was surprised. “Oooohh! Snotty! You’ve turned into a real man now I can’t even recognize you anymore!”</p>\n<p>“Haha… you’re surely jest young lady,” Snotty said.</p>\n<p>“No, really…” with fingers on her chin, eyes on muscles, Mila added, “you really transformed into something new, Snotty. I’m impressed. You were so skinny and really a snotty boy back then.”</p>\n<p>The man continued to laugh. The atmosphere was friendly and harmless. Yet Monkey, who had long heard Snotty’s real identity and preceding reputation from Snake’s mouth, began sweating profusely.</p>\n<p>Mila really loved gifted cosmetics and the like. After knowing how effective it was for her beauty, she shamelessly asked, “Can I ask for more, Grandpa Piss? I have a good friend who needs to be a beauty--as soon as possible!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, of course I have more--here, take this,” Grandpa Piss took out another one.</p>\n<p>“Waow!” Mila’s eyes sparkled in a weird glint. Shira, who saw that, knew his cousin’s greed began to surface; suddenly the unruly young lady acted as if she was a timid maiden. “Grandpa Piss… I think my other friend needs it too…” she asked sweetly.</p>\n<p>“Hohoh!” Grandpa Piss stroked his beard again. “Unfortunately, my princess, I’ve got only three pack and I planned to give the last one for Young Lady Malikh.”</p>\n<p>Hearing a certain short-haired girl being mentioned, the shy maiden’s face twisted in an ugly sour face, returned back to her original color. “Tch.”</p>\n<p>“Hey, don’t click your tongue in front of elders,” Shira warned her.</p>\n<p>“Tch.” Mila crossed her arms and threw away her pouting face.</p>\n<p>Shira was always frustrated whenever a younger one like him would be the one to reprimand ethics into this blockhead of a girl.</p>\n<p>“Now, now, young lady. Please remember Grandpa’s already too old to concoct too many cosmetics--getting two packs already good enough,” Snotty said.</p>\n<p>Snake looked at the leaves wrapped cosmetics in Mila’s hands and exclaimed, “Grandfather concocted them himself?”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss nodded with an amiable smile. “Of course. Been twelve years since the last time I was here. It’d be embarrassing if I came with half-hearted gifts, don’t you think so?”</p>\n<hr>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>The nickname of “Grandpa Piss” stuck on Grandmaster Alchemist’s name for twelve years. When a friend of his asked the origin of this horrible nickname, the Grandmaster laughed it off and said a princess of his old friend’s family started calling him that, because her cousin who was still a three years old brat urinated on him every time the Grandmaster tried to hug him.</p>\n<p>Legend said that the princess was also calling the heir of Grandmaster Alchemist’s family with the nickname of “Snotty”. But even to this day, nobody knows which kingdom this cheeky princess comes from.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n","volume-3/chapter-3":"<p>What the Nalaq told Shira lingered in his mind. Good-Natured Spirit blurted something about killing someone as if it was something trivial that could popped out easily in normal conversation. To kill someone after finding out his secret--what kind of secret he needed to protect anyway? A secret he never wanted people to know the fact he was drawing semi-porns for money. But he wasn’t that insecure to kill someone over a petty secret like that? That would be him being not right in the head. The more he thought about Good-Natured Spirit’s remark, the more it disturbed him. Especially right now, when his hands painted in red, bathed in blood. When he just did an act of actual killing.</p>\n<p>“Something on your mind, Young Master Shira?” a rough voice disturbed his train of thought.</p>\n<p>“Ah,” Shira looked at a burly man, an experienced hunter, who called him.</p>\n<p>The man’s body even drenched in thicker blood than him. One would get easily nauseated by the sight of it. Yet it didn’t make the boy flinched, as he was expecting the experience for a few months already.</p>\n<p>“Here. Look at his gut. Spilling out his innards with your own hands might be a good experience for you, young master.”</p>\n<p>The hunter spun a sharp dagger, holding it by the tip of its blade, having a gesture of offering it to his young master.</p>\n<p>“Is that okay? I even had trouble when skinning the hide,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>He’d rather not, to be honest, since splitting a goat’s gut could be messy if he did it crudely. Even if he was the young master of the family, when messing with the raw meat, not even his uncle could save him from the aunties’ nagging. Shira Yashura was nearly sixteen, almost reaching adulthood, so he had to participate in butchering goats; it was a quite tasking task, but was easy enough compared to butchering cows he had to do in a few years. But for the fifteen years old young master, getting the hang of the butchering knife’s handle was plenty of experience already for him.</p>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>As the custom dictates, every month in ngajen ceremony preparation, the boys will have to deal with cows and goats while the girls help aunties plucking chickens’ and ducks’ feathers. Whether the gatekeepers' children or the family’s next heirs, all of them are required to do it every time a major ceremony approaches.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>After doing his part in butchering a goat Shira immediately took a bath to remove the bloody pungent. On a whim he then strolled to the kitchen to grab some snacks. There he witnessed how all the coconuts he and his uncle shred already transformed into delicious foods; rendang, Bulayak satay, coconut satay, spicy curry, many other mouth drolling coconut cuisines. The coconut loving uncle was all smiles and gave him a big portion of the famous beef cuisine the locals called rendang--which, normally, even for a young master like Shira would get to eat rendang once every few months. But with enough wit and experience in currying favor with his uncle, he got to taste those delicious food handed down by his uncle, the Chief Chef, personally.</p>\n<p>“Shira my boy,” Patriarch Shuro said to his nephew who was squatting below the shadow of a thick pillar, happily munching on his rendang, “you’re going to visit Malikh Family tonight. Keep a good check on your cousin. Don’t embarrass Yashura Family and present our rendang_ _for their main family.”</p>\n<p>“Sure.”</p>\n<hr>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>Domesticated cows were less in numbers than goats in Badril Village, so meals from cows, not including the innards which could be made into popular but cheap cuisines, like only served for village big shots or important visitors during the ngajen ceremony.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>Laughters and chatters made the night more merry than any other thay of the month. It was brighter than usual, as villagers came out of their house to set up big braziers to light the road between the families that were holding festives. From one hundred meters away, through the thick wall of the big families, the mouth-watering aroma of prepared food wafted through the air as if they informally invited people to come and to taste the delicacy these big families had. The change in scenery upon the arrival of the night signaled the nigh of Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>Yashura Family, the oldest family around, was known to have the best food amongst all families in Badril Village, while Elzhier Family known as the family that always threw the biggest party post-ceremony--Elzhier Family’s maidservants were beautiful and they’d show off their voluptuous bodies every single ngajen ceremony. Particularly this month however, everyone was anticipating the ceremony thrown by Malikh Family; for two years since the young lady’s absence they threw nothing more than mediocre festivities, her return was to be seen as their revival on the village’s political stage. And from how big their arrangement looked like, it seemed Malikh Family didn’t plan to fail everyone’s expectations.</p>\n<p>Shira Yashura wore the same suit he got from his uncle on his fifteenth birthday. It was the usual suit he’d wear whenever a ceremony was held. His uncle bought it from a merchant who had connections outside the kingdom, which was pretty good since the fabric wasn’t stiff, but could get unbearably itchy in places he didn’t want to scratch whenever there were people around. The obvious part missing from the wears his peers were wearing was beast pelts.</p>\n<p>Pelts from ferocious beasts were known for irrefutable proof for boys’ courage and manliness. As many young gentlemen of Badril Village wore on their necks, always looking for the opportunity to show off the trophy of their preys to girls--which translated as fashionable fads for boys who wanted to get laids.</p>\n<p>Of course, Shira, as part of the dull and no-nonsense camp of the boys in Badril Village, never had participated in that kind of indecent business. He was so dull that the only girl who would accompany him to attend ceremonies was his cousin Mila--who, even though her face was quite pretty, also happened to be in terrible luck for romance.</p>\n<p>“No matter how many times I see it, it’s always impressive to see how fast you wrap all these banana leaves,” Shira commented as he watched how Mila wrapped rendang with banana leaves. She was very good at it, comparable to the aunties’ skills that had been forged day and night in the family’s kitchen.</p>\n<p>“You talking? You’ve done your training with the family's sword technique, I assume?” Mila said with her lips pouted. Shira thought it was unusual for Mila didn’t nag her mouth off immediately when she saw him. He saw a sword wrapped in cloth near Mila. His face immediately twisted in a troubled look.</p>\n<p>“I won’t bring that thing,” he protested.</p>\n<p>“You--” Mila hissed.</p>\n<p>“What should I do with a sword inside another family’s ceremony?” Shira said. The sword was his father’s, and that was his reason he didn’t want to use it. “Look, I can only draw the blade from the sheath at most. Without a proper amount of Strength attribute I can’t swing this properly. It rejects my mana. I’d make a fool out of myself if that happened.”</p>\n<p>“That’s because you were stupidly increasing your Wisdom instead of, that’s why you--arghh! Just forget about it! I know you’re trying to make excuses! Since you’re so weak all we can do is flaunting around your father’s reputation. We’ve got to remind people that our Yashura Family’s not to mess with. Here, just slip this fucking sword in your belt.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, this is embarrassing. Those rumors are about to get worse tonight,” Shira said with a sigh. His reputation as a trash talent was annoying enough, added this shameless act of throwing his weight around, he’d become more reluctant to show his face in the public later on. But still he unwillingly slipped the sword in his belt.</p>\n<p>Mila snorted. She ignored the complaint. Right now she could care less about the rumors about her cousin. What she had to prioritize tonight was the bad premonition she had about Bhela Malikh’s short hair--nobody believed her when she said that Bhela was being a slut for cutting her hair short in spite of her being in an engagement. While her hands craftly knotted the rendang wrapped in banana leaves with a rope made with dried coconut leaves, she suddenly had a cold smile; the image of those impudent Malikhs shuddering under the famous sword of Yashura Family’s Unique Class, Jhuro Yashura the Blackfang Swordsman, entertained her she began to chuckle coldly.</p>\n<p>“Huhuhu… just you wait you bitch…”</p>\n<p>Shira stepped back. He had the hunch he should keep a distance away from his current cousin right now.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Every month, for every family in Badril Village, cooking during the Ngajen Ceremony was always a time rushing hectic. Even more in Malikh Family this time. Since the amount of food they had to deliver before the ceremony started more than twice the amount they made last month, most of the aunties in duty were cooking outdoors. The smoke from the half-dried firewood would be too unbearable for the eyes if all of them cooked in one cramped place. Fortunately, most of the dishes were already cooked and sent to the courtyard, so the only people who were still on duty preparing food were a small number of aunties and maidservants.</p>\n<p>The young maidservants were pale from tiredness but they couldn’t afford to slack in this one Ngajen Ceremony. The usual noisy aunties, they didn’t even show a sign of wanting to rest. Nobody could beat the resilience of the kitchen-duty armies when it came to preparing for a loadful of party’s foods.</p>\n<p>Usually, the one who would supervise these spartan cooking aunties would be the patriarch’s wife, Bhela’s mother. It was already a long-held tradition in the village for the patriarch to cook for the family’s important guests as the Chief Chef, while the wife supported him by supervising the aunties and maidservants. In Ngajen Ceremony this month, however, Bhela’s mother holed herself to accompany the husband on his ill-bed.</p>\n<p>She was not in the mood to meet with people. So Bhela stepped in to fill her position.</p>\n<p>Back when she was little Bhela often followed her mother working during the ngajen ceremony, she knew what she had to do by the back of her hand. In usage of salt, for example, she knew down to the tiniest detail of how much salt should be applied to different kinds of cuisines. She also instructed the inexperienced maidservants who were in charge of cooking side dishes so the overall quality of the feast would be balanced. Bhela Malikh didn’t betray everyone’s expectations about her. She did her work splendidly.</p>\n<p>However, there was a matter she saw that didn’t make her happy. The largest furnace that was usually reserved for the Chief Chef, today was used by an old man from the outer family. A great cook, the old man was. Known for his vast experience in handling the family’s food stalls for years. The problem was his common status. Without at least an elder status made it awkward for him to cook as the Chief Chef in this kitchen, even if he was a mere proxy. Bhela wondered whether the one who took the charge when her parents were unavailable knew the risk of being laughed at and criticized by the other two big families--especially now that the relationship between Yashura and Malikh wasn’t that good like before.</p>\n<p>“Young lady, the day’s getting dark, you should take a bath now and prepare yourself for the ceremony,” an aunty said to Bhela.</p>\n<p>“Yes, young lady is no longer a little girl, so making you pretty will take a while,” an early twenty maidservant added from the side. She continued, “The new girls should be able to complete the foods since you directed them a lot. Please don’t worry about us.”</p>\n<p>“I’m relieved to hear that,” Bhela said. Not yet three seconds later her eyes wandered to the old cook again. She couldn’t hide her frown.</p>\n<p>“Something the matter, Young Lady Bhela?”</p>\n<p>“Yes. Maybe it’s a misunderstanding on my part but… I can’t see the elder who would substitute my father as the Chief Chef.”</p>\n<p>Hearing Bhela said her concern, the aunties and the maidservants averted eyes with their young lady with troubled faces. Bhela then understood there was something shady going on.</p>\n<p>Her suspicion turned worse when she saw a young man in his twenties leading four manservants with him. When the aunties were working in the kitchen, it was an unspoken rule for unrelated adult men not to approach, but the battle-hardened aunties that normally were ferocious in defending their territories were all silent in welcoming the cocky visitors. It wasn’t surprising to Bhela that all of them came from Elder Jhamil’s faction.</p>\n<p>“Why aren’t you ready yet, old worm?!”</p>\n<p>“I am sorry, young elder… some dish cannot be rushed so I prepared some to--”</p>\n<p><em>Slap!!</em></p>\n<p>The slapping sound echoed in the kitchen. The room descended into a dead silent. The old cook was trembling; he lowered his head and covered the cheek that just got slapped but everyone could see the blood on the corner of his mouth. Bhela recollected her memory, and finally remembered the arrogant young man was actually Elder Jhamil’s own son.</p>\n<p>“Shit!” Elder Jhamil’s son swore, “those councils from Village Hall came. We must complete the set before too long! Those people are the ones who usually have the heaviest voice when valuing Ngajen Ceremony dishes!”</p>\n<p>One follower quipped, “Young elder is right. This old worm can’t cook shit! If this goes on, the only things the Village Hall council will remember about Elder Jhamil’s cooking is that we Malikhs cook as slow as snail!”</p>\n<p>The frown on Bhela’s face became deeper. Young elder? Before she went out for the seminars that lasted two years, this man, son of Elder Jhamil, merely a family member with a post within the family’s business. And something else that disturbed her was how she couldn’t see how the blurted about Elder Jhamil’s cooking, the one who worked in the kitchen all day, didn’t see the said elder even once today.</p>\n<p>Bhela still held her silent. But her eyes were cold and sharp judging people and the situation. The aunties and the maidservants, though they looked sympathetic with the old man, were afraid to go against Elder Jhamil’s son. Maybe because the lack of resistance Elder Jhamil’s son dared to do a taboo known in the kitchen--swapping food that wrapped in banana leaves with ceramic plates, garnished a bit, and called it the Chief Chef’s cuisine.</p>\n<p>“No, young elder!” a brave middle-aged aunty stepped forward, “you can’t do that!”</p>\n<p>“Why not?” one follower sneered in Elder Jhamil’s son’s place. “This one also got beef, isn’t it? We need to quickly serve the Chief Chef cuisine to the people from Village Hall councils.”</p>\n<p>“Exactly because they are from the Village Hall council--just from inferior cuts of the beef they’d know the dishes have been swapped! You’ll tarnish Malikh Family’s honor if people knew you were fooling--”</p>\n<p>“Fooling?!” Elder Jhamil roared.</p>\n<p>The young elder raised his hand, though the aunty who complained quickly hid back behind the maidservants. Elder Jhamil’s son then rampaged into a series of barking, yelling and threatening the aunties to cut their salary just because his mood was spoiled.</p>\n<p>His words scared all the girls and the women inside the kitchen. All except Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>After they were done swapping the foods, the young elder led his men out of the kitchen with great swagger. The young elder stopped at the door, turned around, and gave the old cook one last ultimatum: “There’ll be a noble in the ceremony so we need rendang for the main course. So go make it, old worm. You know what’s gonna happen if you couldn’t deliver, don’t you?”</p>\n<p>The old man trembled. Even the eyes on the aunties couldn’t help but shake at the threat. There was now way they could prepare rendang with only two hours remaining until the Ngajen Ceremony started.</p>\n<p>After that situation calmed down. The aunties and the maidservants went back to work. Some of them still exchanged whispered and gossiped amongst themselves. But when Bhela approached, immediately they stopped and pretended nothing happened.</p>\n<p>“Young lady…” a pudgy aunty came to her, the one who stood up against the young elder from before.</p>\n<p>“Aunty?”</p>\n<p>“We are sorry… we’ve had no meaning to show you that embarrassing scene.”</p>\n<p>Bhela shook her head. “No, I’m one from the main family bloodline; I should've been the one who stood up to him instead of hiding behind everyone.”</p>\n<p>The aunty knew the young lady didn’t say a word before because the girl wanted to know the situation. Some other middle-aged aunties who were close with Madam Malikh also knew more or less Bhela’s detached wait-and-see attitude, so no one really would blame her even if she didn’t say a word before--especially since she had just returned from overseas. The pudgy aunty tugged on Bhela’s sleeve, whispered to her ear, “Young Lady Bhela, we know you’re concerned. But we’ve already gotten used to it. You’re still young. Your future is brighter than everyone else in the family, Young Lady Bhela. It’s better to endure than pointlessly making enemies.”</p>\n<p>“This isn’t pointless,” Bhela said. She then grabbed the nearest apron and wore it. Her father was the patriarch. And she wasn’t a poster girl to draw everyone’s attention to the family.</p>\n<p>The pudgy aunty wanted to say something again. But words stuck on her throat, she closed her mouth as soon as she opened it.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the old man began to pick some mature coconut and shredded it listlessly. He got more than four decades of handling food stalls for Malikh Family, he wasn’t a stranger at cooking rendang. But he already gave up on finishing one for tonight’s Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>“Uncle, I’ll take it from here,” Bhela said as she approached the weary old man.</p>\n<p>“Ahh, yes?” the old man was started. The girl came with an apron and common garment, had fair and beautiful skin, as well clear and articulate voice; a maidservant from the inner family was the first one that came to his mind. But only when he noticed even the aunties were respectful to her and her striking bob-cut short hair that the old man began drenched in cold sweat.</p>\n<p>“I said, uncle,” Bhela repeated, “I’ll take it from here. You can rest now.”</p>\n<p>The old man vigorously shook his head.</p>\n<p>“Please Young Lady Bhela… please spare this old bone….”</p>\n<p>“This is originally my father’s post, uncle. You’ll have to be at least an elder and write your name in council’s ledger to be a substitute for my father.”</p>\n<p>The old man wanted to break into a tearless cry. This is worse than when he faced Elder Jhamil’s son's harassment before. The most thing he was afraid of was the news of Elder Jhamil using him as Chief Chef behind the scene to reach the ears of the main family. And now that Bhela Malikh was here, there was nothing he could do but to resign his life to fate.</p>\n<p>“Y-young lady!” a maidservant yelled, “you can’t!”</p>\n<p>“Who says I can’t?” Bhela asked sharply.</p>\n<p>An aunty, who had a stern-looking face, said, “You can’t cook for the main course, young lady. In case of a patriarch's absence, usually one of the elders who’s going to take his place. There’s no rule saying it’s okay for women to do it.”</p>\n<p>“Then, I’m going to ask,” from the aunty, Bhela threw her glance toward the old man, “are you an elder cooking here to substitute my father as a cook, uncle?”</p>\n<p>The old man’s face turned pale. Whichever the answer of that question would lead him to the road of punishment. All of the sudden, he became a mute.</p>\n<p>Because she had the most standing, nobody made a sound when Young Lady Bhela Malikh asked them to fetch chickens and spices for her.</p>\n<p>Not long after, the story about how the Young Lady of Malikh Family wanted to substitute her father spread like a wildfire. Never in Badril Village’s history would a young lady do that. A crowd of curious males, mostly the youngsters from main and outer of Malikh Family, surrounded the kitchen as they wanted to catch a glimpse of how their beautiful young lady recklessly challenged the custom by her own. The boys sighed in admiration. Bhela Malikh was essentially an Archer at heart. But the way she handled a blade, even if it was a kitchen knife, was skillful and graceful, as every time her slim wrist stopped moving from cutting down a vegetable, a wave of gulping could be heard. The boys couldn’t take their eyes from her. The reckless and brave young lady was simply too charming.</p>\n<p>“Did you know that foreigners often confuse rendang as dried curry?” Bhela said to one maidservant who stared at the way she cooked. “Curry leaves originated from an area close to western Haldeen lands, so many local Mossacks sailed the sea to try their luck making it big working for western empires.”</p>\n<p>The usual aloof Bhela unusually was talkative when she was cooking, which was quite a big surprise for people who were watching. She explained to the clueless maidservants how, during her two years travelling in seminars from countries to countries, found many noble owned restaurants claimed to serve rendang but turned out to be dried curry. All the while sharply focused on doing her cooking duty.</p>\n<p>“Young lady!” from the crowd came out an angry bald man. He was Elder Jhamil. “W-what are you doing there?”</p>\n<p>“I’m cooking,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“But you can’t work there!” Elder Jhamil yelled. “No woman can substitute for patriarch! That’s against the rule!”</p>\n<p>“I don’t recall we have a rule like that.”</p>\n<p>“If you know why you still stand there?”</p>\n<p>“Neither do I recall a rule for an elder to use a stand-in for the Chief Chef position.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s face turned weird as if he suddenly got constipated. Many of the youngsters didn’t catch Bhela’s remarks nor they cared too much about it, but some in the crowd were nodding knowingly, as many of them were familiar with how shady Elder Jhamil was doing things.</p>\n<p>As the bald elder’s head was racing fast looking for an answer to defuse the young lady’s claim, suddenly, a loud roar exploded behind him.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela, who do you think you are? Just because your father is the family’s patriarch you think you can do whatever you want?!”</p>\n<p>The faces of aunties and the maidservants twitched. They witnessed how the young elder harassed the old man before, so they were itching to throw back the same question at him instead, though no more brave aunties dared to cause more troubles.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s son continued, “The ingredient for making Chief dishes takes money, young lady. Not even the patriarch himself has the daring to use coins from the treasury for himself. Do you want to embarrass your parents that much?”</p>\n<p>“I’m not making this food for myself nor I cook for my father. It’s for the guests. And I provided the spices and the foreign curry leaves by myself,” Bhela said. Some maidservants behind her nodded nervously as Bhela indeed ordered them to fetch spices from the personal kitchen in the main family’s residential area.</p>\n<p>In spite of that, the young elder kept pushing on with nasty smile on his face.</p>\n<p>“What about the chicken, young lady? They cost money! What do you say about that, huh?”</p>\n<p>Behind Bhela, the aunties, even the maidservants, were whispering at each other on how ridiculous it was to question the sole young generation of Malikh Family main bloodline over some chickens. Even Bhela, the young lady in question, would only glanced at the troubled expression of Elder Jhamil.</p>\n<p>“I will pay for the chicken,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Ha? Pay? With what? Your father’s money? Can’t a sick person even pay the cost of the foods for ngajen ceremony all by himself?”</p>\n<p>“No need to bring my father’s name here.” Bhela said with a dangerously cold tone.</p>\n<p>The chillness in her eyes was telling that she really did hate people bringing her parents’ name in bad faith. After hearing gasps of surprise from people that didn’t expect the usually silent young lady could utter something with such a biting tone, she sighed, said with an explanation, “I got a dress as a gift from a certain person who has too much money in his pocket. He said the dress is so valuable even the princesses wear them in parties. It should cover the cost of these chickens I’m going to cook if I sell the dress right here right now.”</p>\n<p>Bhela then tilted her head and glanced at the bald elder.</p>\n<p>“Am I right, Elder Jhamil?”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil wanted to maintain his smile, but his face went stiff as stone. He was trembling inside for knowing that the dress he acquired with a large sum of money and with his best connection, valued the same as some mere village chickens in Bhela’s eyes.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, his son, who was taken aback for a bit from the cold remark Bhela had said earlier, recovered, began to yell again, “Ha! Did you not train your brain when you were overseas, my young lady? The same dress princesses wear in parties? Only someone dumb believe that! Hah! Obviously you’ve been lied to! You’ve been crooked, young lady, crooked--”</p>\n<p><em>Paak!</em></p>\n<p>From behind, the already red-faced Elder Jhamil smacked his son’s head. “You’ve been rude to Young Lady Bhela, you dumbskull! You have to apologize! Young lady can’t bear to hear it anymore!”</p>\n<p>While in fact it was him who couldn’t bear to hear being called a crook.</p>\n<p>“Apologize!” Elder Jhamil roared.</p>\n<p><em>Splash!</em></p>\n<p>The pair father and son’s performance didn’t amuse Bhela, however. With the lid in her hand, Bhela scooped boiling curry broth and splashed it to their direction. Surprised, the stupid young elder swore with nasty words while his father cried in high-pitched voice.</p>\n<p>“Please get out,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil laughed wryly.</p>\n<p>“Please don’t be like that, young lady. I know my son doesn't have the best education but--”</p>\n<p><em>Splash!!</em></p>\n<p>Bhela waved the cooking lid once again as soon as Elder Jhamil stepped forward. The hot water splashed on his expensive boots. This time, while he didn’t expect for Bhela splashing hot water at him again, he wasn’t freaking out. It seemed his plan to make the young lady behave a little backfiring instead. His face turned solemn.</p>\n<p>“Young lady…”</p>\n<p>“I’m not going to say it thrice--everyone who has nothing to do in the kitchen, please get out,” Bhela said. “Or else--”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The major families’ lands were astonishingly spacious and complex, their walls were thick and tall, therefore each of them employed a few stationary guards for the main gate as gatekeepers. These gatekeepers, though usually filled by members of the outer part of the families, their duty were significantly more important than others since they represented the face of the family they served. So they always maintain polite gestures to everyone who came through their gate, either commoners or rich people from big families. Yet when Shira and Mila arrived the Malikh Family’s gatekeepers didn’t even hide their scoffs.</p>\n<p>“Ridiculous!” she hissed with a face boiled in anger, “even lowly gatekeepers are looking down on us!”</p>\n<p>“Don’t bother with them,” Shira said. Unlike his cousin’s furious temper, his flair seemed like he shrugged the blatant disrespect, as the holder of “Eternal Novice” title he was already numb by how people were talking behind his back.</p>\n<p>“If your father was here they’d bow their asses as soon as they saw us Yashura coming.”</p>\n<p>Shira shrugged his shoulders again.</p>\n<p>Still seething in anger, Mila cast her eyes on the banana leaves wrapped food in Shira’s hands. “Who should we give the rendang to?” she asked.</p>\n<p>“Let’s just give it to a random servant.” Then Shira called a maidservant who was carrying a tray full of food. “Excuse me!”</p>\n<p>“Yes? What can I help y--” The moment this maidservant turned her head and saw Shira’s face, she immediately threw back her eyes and escaped with hurried trot, pretending she saw nothing.</p>\n<p>“The fuck?!” Mila was flastergabbed, didn’t know what to say.</p>\n<p>Later on Shira and Mila realized how unpopular Yashura Family was to the current Malikhs, even the servants who usually held no voice in the family were avoiding the pair of cousins like plague. Their attitude especially worsened when it came to Shira Yashura.</p>\n<p>“Look there,” someone whispered amongst the guests, “Yashura Family send their eldest young miss and the young master! Out of all the Ngajen Ceremony, they choose tonight to show their faces--pretty obvious, eh? Bet they’re drooling to get another Unique Class after knowing our Young Lady Bhela’s real talent tonight!”</p>\n<p>Someone else agreed and replied, “With that kind of trash as their young master, they’d be dreamin’ to get even a touch of our Young Lady Bhela. Pueh!”</p>\n<p>Hearing the muffled disdain, Mila Yashura whirled her body, glaring people with eagle eyes. “Who said that?!” she growled.</p>\n<p>“Mila…” Shira held her shoulder.</p>\n<p>“The fuckers don’t even put our Yashura Family in their eyes. Just because shitty rumors about Unique Class they started to feel high and mighty, eh?”</p>\n<p>“Just let go, Uncle Shuro didn’t send us here to start troubles,” Shira said. “All we need to do is to show our faces here and give them our rendang. It’s not our problem whether they welcome our good intention with grace or not.”</p>\n<p>Though Shira said that, he secretly hoped Malikh Family would grow too proud to receive it--all so he had an excuse to keep his uncle’s rendang for himself.</p>\n<p>A commotion arose. People hussing here and there with excitement. When Shira and Mila wanted to know what was going on, a parade of beautiful young women glittering and stealing the whole show came from inside of Malikh Family’s hall. Leading them was a short-haired young beauty, face as icy as an ice sculpture, the recent name that everyone had been talking about these days, Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>It was clear from the way Bhela positioned herself she represented the family as the ceremony’s Chief Chef.</p>\n<p>“Whoa, so Malikh Family let her do that,” Shira murmured.</p>\n<p>Not to mention being the Chief Chef--the most Shira did in his family’s kitchen was helping his uncle, helping him shred coconuts. They were at the same age, but the same old Shira still practiced butchering goats while the supposed fiancée of his was climbing the social ladder. Even Mila was angry by the special treatment Malikh Family gave to their young lady.</p>\n<p>“Sup, young master!” from behind a voice called him.</p>\n<p>Shira turned around, found the one who greeted him was Monkey.</p>\n<p>“Who?” Mila asked Shira as the stranger with a monkey-like face approaching.</p>\n<p>“This one is called by the name of Monkey, young lady,” Monkey, with his self-trained Mossack’s style bowing gesture, introduced himself smoothly.</p>\n<p>Mila hummed in ackwnoledgement. It was harder to forget than remembering someone with such combination of face and awkward name.</p>\n<p>“Mister Monkey, I thought you’ll spend the ceremony to show Mister Snake around since he’s an outsider. What are you doing in Malikh Family?” Shira asked.</p>\n<p>“Now, now, please drop the ‘Mister’, young master. I’m not that old yet to be called as such,” Monkey said, then he continued explaining his story this evening. “We were planning to go to your family’s ceremony, young master. But who would have thought Snake to meet with his relatives here? His relatives are actually Malikh Family’s guests for tonight’s Ngajen Ceremony. Bet he got to eat expensive cuisines right now.”</p>\n<p>“Well, it’ll be easier with Mister Snake here. I’ve got some coins I want to show you, I wonder if it works to use them for--” Shira sneakily glanced at his cousin, then turned back to Monkey like it was nothing, “--for the thing we talked about yesterday.”</p>\n<p>Mila sneered, “You have some business to attend, no?”</p>\n<p>“Not really, no,” Shira shrugged off her question.</p>\n<p>“Really, though?” Mila crossed her arms, sneered again. “I think I saw Romana just now. I’mma chat with her a little bit.”</p>\n<p>It seemed to Shira that his cousin meeting with Romana here, in Malikh Family’s Ngajen Ceremony, wasn’t simply to have fun. He didn’t like his cousin would make trouble but he didn’t want to spend the whole night with her either. “Don’t go home without me,” he said eventually.</p>\n<p>“Hmph! You’re not a kid anymore but still need me to accompany you home?”</p>\n<p>No, Shira actually was more worried about her than himself.</p>\n<p>He then glanced beside and said, “Mister Monkey.”</p>\n<p>“Just Monkey,” Monkey corrected.</p>\n<p>“Mister Just Monkey, you said Mister Snake with relative? And his relatives are Malikh Family’s guests?”</p>\n<p>“Not Just Mon--ah, forget about it,” Monkey already gave up guessing whether Young Master Shira Yashura was purposely pulling his leg or not. “They really were Malikh Family’s guests, they even got the front row for the prayer and all.”</p>\n<p>“Is hard for us to be friendly if Mister Snake is involved with Malikh Family.”</p>\n<p>“You mean, that, huh? Well, I’ve been here for a while and they talked about you a lot, so I guess even someone as chill as you can get angry sometimes. But you don’t have to worry about those Malikhs, Young Master Shira. As long as their patriarch is Ghalim Malikh they won’t sever ties with Yashura so easily.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, is this your opinion?”</p>\n<p>“It’s Snake’s. It’s what he said before he met his relatives.”</p>\n<p>Shira thought the Alchemist he met once before was a total stranger of Badril Village, but it appeared he was wrong. “He really does know about Malikh Family that much, doesn’t he?”</p>\n<p>“Well, yeah, but I think he’s more familiar with Yashura than Malikh Family, though,” Monkey said, crossing his arms and nodded to himself as he recalled things that Snake told him to get his wares supported by Yashura Family; for example, obtaining Butler Yulong’s permission the same as Patriarch Shuro Yashura’s, Snake once said.</p>\n<p>“What? Why do you make that kind of face, Young Master Shira?” Monkey was snapped from his train of thought.</p>\n<p>“Ah, no, I just don’t expect you’re going to say some like that.”</p>\n<p>“What are you saying, young master. In the first place, Snake became my crew because he heard I’ve some dealing with Yashura Family.”</p>\n<p>Shira did recall the first time Monkey contacted Yashura Family--through him. To be more exact, the first item Monkey dealt from Malikh Family was Shira’s smuggled erotic painting that Good-Natured Spirit rejected.</p>\n<p>“--Speaking of Snake,” with his thumb Monkey did point in a certain direction. The place was separated from the common guest as they indeed were Malikh Family’s special guests. Shira’s eyes followed and he saw the familiar Alchemist he knew not long ago, Snake, was talking with two men, young and old, most likely brother and his grandfather.</p>\n<p>“Don’t be fooled by their appearances, young master. They’re renowned experts,” Monkey said.</p>\n<p>The pair of brother and grandfather wore worn out pale robes as their clothes, unlike the image of revered experts in Shira’s mind. Monkey told him both likely to travel incognito for various reasons. The old man had an old white hair and long beard, his back crooked and had to bring a walking staff to support himself, and gave people the impression of a sleepy grandpa from the dim light on his eyes. The young one though, had an always angry-looking face with fierce brows, crossing his muscle-thick arms, locked in a debate with Snake. Snake’s face was notably paler than when Shira met him in the market.</p>\n<p>“We can’t greet Mister Snake now, can we?” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think we can,” Monkey said. Even though he long considered Snake as his partner, the two guests appearing incognito were still the main members of the revered Alchemist family. This was no time for commoners like him acting friendly on them all of the sudden.</p>\n<p>The sleepy-looking old man, noticing two pairs of eyes looking at him, he raised his head. He caught the sight of Shira. Their eyes met.</p>\n<p>“Oh ho,” the old man smiled when he found the boy. He dragged his old body to approach the flastergabbed Shira and Monkey.</p>\n<p>Even Monkey who knew more about them wouldn’t expect Snake’s relatives to introduce themselves first.</p>\n<p>“He’s heading this way…”</p>\n<p>“Ah, yes, apparently.”</p>\n<p>Monkey gulped. “It’s different with Snake. Although he looked like that, whatever you do, please, young master, you can’t afford to be rude in front of this elder…”</p>\n<p>From the nervousness in Monkey’s voice Shira found the approaching old man seemed to hail from a more prestigious family than he originally thought.</p>\n<p>“Greeting, elder,” Shira said with his head humbly lowered as soon as he approached.</p>\n<p>The old man chuckled, patted Shira’s head, said, “Ah, Young Master, look how much you’ve grown. It feels like only yesterday how happy you were running around like a little kid you are.”</p>\n<p>Shira nodded hearing that. He glanced beside him, and caught Monkey’s face flabbergasted looking both at the boy and the old man.</p>\n<p>Hiding his embarrassment behind a fake cough, Shira then tried to understand whether the old man mistook him for someone else. “I’m sorry, elder. I don’t know if I’m mistaken, but, have we met before?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, have we met? Of course we’ve--” he stopped. The old man's eyes were covered by a pair of soft hands of a girl.</p>\n<p>“Guess who this is?” the girl who sneakily teased the old man from behind was grinning.</p>\n<p>“Oho! Who is this? Who is this?” the old man smiled delightedly.</p>\n<p>Both Shira and Monkey were tense watching the scene before them. Especially Shira Yashura, who knew that the grin on his cousin’s face always told that the girl enjoyed herself a little bit too much.</p>\n<p>“Isn’t this… Tomboy Princess?” the old man guessed.</p>\n<p>“Tuut! Wrong!”</p>\n<p>Mila released her hands. When the old man turned to see the preparator, he exclaimed with a chuckle.</p>\n<p>“It’s really you, Tomboy Princess.”</p>\n<p>Mila excitedly echoed, “It’s really you, Grandpa Piss!”</p>\n<p>They were so glad they met after a long time that they started to hug each other. Then Mila pull herself from the oldman’s embrace, yelling, “Ugghh…” she pinched her nose, “I smell something pissy around here.”</p>\n<p>Just when Shira and Monkey wondered what Mila meant by that, the girl looked at the old man, saying, “It’s no wonder it smells pissy. Have you taken a bath, Grandpa Piss.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss answered with a laugh. But Shira and Monkey facepalmed.</p>\n<p>So much for being mindful in front of the revered old expert.</p>\n<p>Shira awkwardly smiled to cover his shame. “Mila, you should be mindful in front of elders.”</p>\n<p>“Mindful?” Mila gasped. “In front of Grandpa Piss? Why?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, it’s okay, young master,” the old man said as he waved his hand. “I’m not that old to lose my sense of humor. Yashura Family’s princess sure is as naughty as always.” His wrinkles deepened as he curled his lips into a big smile. He said to Mila, “I reckon Patriarch Shuro’s been well, my princess? I recall he got a lot of migraines back in the day.”</p>\n<p>Haughtily, Mila replied, “Don’t worry about that guy, Grandpa Piss. His brain capacity has been declining these past years so there’s really nothing left inside to give him any headache!”</p>\n<p>“Ehem,” Shira cleared his phlegm. “She meant our patriarch has been well, elder.”</p>\n<p>“That’s what I said,” Mila laughed, and the old man laughed too. After that Mila kissed Grandpa Piss’s right hand as if she was kissing an elder’s hand from her own family, then continued laughing as cheeky as always.</p>\n<p>“My naughty princess,” Grandpa Piss ruffled Mila’s hair, “I planned to visit Yashura Family later. But since we’ve already met, here, please take this.”</p>\n<p>Receiving a pack wrapped in dried leaves, Mila pouted her lips. “You wouldn’t be lying about this being a candy again, would you?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, of course not.”</p>\n<p>As far as her memory served her well, what Grandpa Piss called candy actually a really bitter herb for young children to gain their appetite. Mila sniffed. She opened it and have a little taste. “Uuueeekk!”</p>\n<p>It was sour and even more bitter than she remembered. “What the hell is this?!”</p>\n<p>“That herb’s not for consumption, Young Lady Mila” the big man with muscles, Snake’s big brother, said from behind Grandpa Piss. He was smiling politely despite the other party merely a young lady of a rural village. “It’s a cosmetic for skin care.”</p>\n<p>“Skin care?!”</p>\n<p>Mila’s mouth widened agape. But soon as she glanced at the muscle man who was approaching her, she became wary, leaned to Grandpa Piss and whispered, “Grandpa Piss, who’s that?”</p>\n<p>With a patient smile replied, Grandpa Piss said, “He’s Snotty. Don’t you remember Snotty?”</p>\n<p>Mila was surprised. “Oooohh! Snotty! You’ve turned into a real man now I can’t even recognize you anymore!”</p>\n<p>“Haha… you’re surely jest young lady,” Snotty said.</p>\n<p>“No, really…” with fingers on her chin, eyes on muscles, Mila added, “you really transformed into something new, Snotty. I’m impressed. You were so skinny and really a snotty boy back then.”</p>\n<p>The man continued to laugh. The atmosphere was friendly and harmless. Yet Monkey, who had long heard Snotty’s real identity and preceding reputation from Snake’s mouth, began sweating profusely.</p>\n<p>Mila really loved gifted cosmetics and the like. After knowing how effective it was for her beauty, she shamelessly asked, “Can I ask for more, Grandpa Piss? I have a good friend who needs to be a beauty--as soon as possible!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, of course I have more--here, take this,” Grandpa Piss took out another one.</p>\n<p>“Waow!” Mila’s eyes sparkled in a weird glint. Shira, who saw that, knew his cousin’s greed began to surface; suddenly the unruly young lady acted as if she was a timid maiden. “Grandpa Piss… I think my other friend needs it too…” she asked sweetly.</p>\n<p>“Hohoh!” Grandpa Piss stroked his beard again. “Unfortunately, my princess, I’ve got only three pack and I planned to give the last one for Young Lady Malikh.”</p>\n<p>Hearing a certain short-haired girl being mentioned, the shy maiden’s face twisted in an ugly sour face, returned back to her original color. “Tch.”</p>\n<p>“Hey, don’t click your tongue in front of elders,” Shira warned her.</p>\n<p>“Tch.” Mila crossed her arms and threw away her pouting face.</p>\n<p>Shira was always frustrated whenever a younger one like him would be the one to reprimand ethics into this blockhead of a girl.</p>\n<p>“Now, now, young lady. Please remember Grandpa’s already too old to concoct too many cosmetics--getting two packs already good enough,” Snotty said.</p>\n<p>Snake looked at the leaves wrapped cosmetics in Mila’s hands and exclaimed, “Grandfather concocted them himself?”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss nodded with an amiable smile. “Of course. Been twelve years since the last time I was here. It’d be embarrassing if I came with half-hearted gifts, don’t you think so?”</p>\n<hr>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>The nickname of “Grandpa Piss” stuck on Grandmaster Alchemist’s name for twelve years. When a friend of his asked the origin of this horrible nickname, the Grandmaster laughed it off and said a princess of his old friend’s family started calling him that, because her cousin who was still a three years old brat urinated on him every time the Grandmaster tried to hug him.</p>\n<p>Legend said that the princess was also calling the heir of Grandmaster Alchemist’s family with the nickname of “Snotty”. But even to this day, nobody knows which kingdom this cheeky princess comes from.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n","volume-3/chapter-4-5":"<p>Badril Village, though had been two years passed without her presence, was the same as always for Bhela Malikh. She hadn’t that many acquaintances her age she could consider friendly before. In spite of that, from the day she returned, people act as if they were her rekindled childhood friends she never knew she had.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” a daughter of an elder from Elzhier Family asked curiously, “is the rumor about that story true?”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at her with eyelids half-closed.</p>\n<p>“Which rumor?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, silly you, of course <em>that</em> rumor! The one about your romance with a blue blood noble!”</p>\n<p>Giggles of girls followed after the girl’s words. When Bhela returned to Badril Village she brought not only fame and reputation, but interesting stories and rumors as well. She was currently surrounded by curious young ladies who sought for exciting gossip.</p>\n<p>“Yeah, yeah!” another girl excitedly hussing in low voice. “I heard he’ll attend Malikh’s ngajen ceremony tonight!”</p>\n<p>“Really?”</p>\n<p>“Why else would Young Lady Bhela take the Chef Chief position if she didn’t expect for her lover to come tonight? He’ll come for sure!”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, yeah, everybody is saying Young Lady Bhela doing just for that!”</p>\n<p>Bhela found it was amazing how people could conjure their own rumors despite not seeing the true story by their own eyes.</p>\n<p>And just when the young ladies started getting excited discussing Young Lady Bhela’s ‘love life’, a vigorous shout resounded the courtyard announcing that Blackwood Family had arrived.</p>\n<p>“Blackwood Family?” someone cocked their head and looked over the direction of the gate. “What kind of family is so bold announcing their names in other family’s ngajen ceremony? Not even Village Head’s Elzhier Family would do to the ceremony host!”</p>\n<p>“Only foreigners to be that stupid to be rude in big family like Malikh! If this is my place I’d send a guard to kick their ass out as soon as possible!”</p>\n<p>“Look over there! Malikh Family elders are rushing to the gate! Let’s check out how’s Malikhs going to deal with it!”</p>\n<p>Curious guests were tailing the elders to see some commotion they thought would occur. However, not only did the Malikhs not make a fuss over it, they even bowed their heads toward the newly arrived noble as if they were servants greeting their returning master. Young people were overly excited because nobles were foreign and appeared in stories all of their lives.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Mila, who already went back with her friend, was gritting teeth with anger. Beside her Romana was holding the tomboy back, though concerned she didn't say a word.</p>\n<p>“Why should I am the one who always had to hold myself back?” Mila hissed in a low voice as if she was wronged.</p>\n<p>“Look around and think about who’s receiving the blow the most. Everyone’s talking about your cousin right now--do you want to make it worse for him?”</p>\n<p>After hearing her friend’s warning, Mila began to take a deep breath and think things through. Romana was right. When she opened her ears Mila could hear people comparing the young master of this noble Blackwood Family with her cousin Shira. They compared such a gallant-looking young noble with a trash of Yashura Family young master, adding with their own biased seasoning here and there, making her cousin Shira look really bad. Mila trembled as her face boiled red from holding back her anger.</p>\n<p>“Where’s Shira right now?”</p>\n<p>“I think he went hiding!” Romana said.</p>\n<p>“Hiding?! He’s embarrassed to show his face that much?”</p>\n<p>After circling around a bit, Mila found the boy’s silhouette in the shadow far from the braziers' light. There, he was squatting, hiding along with two other silhouettes who were also squatting in a suspicious manner.</p>\n<p>“Now, young master, where the hell did you get this coin?” someone whispered from the suspicious bunch.</p>\n<p>The reply came also in the same hushed manner. “Don’t ask me now, just know I’ve got a few more hidden in my house. I can’t move my family, but if you’re fine with this, I can invest in your goods earlier.”</p>\n<p>“We’re fine? Of course we’re fine! Don’t you know how amazing this coin is?”</p>\n<p>“It’s amazing? I can’t even buy satays with this. Nobody here would receive unfamiliar currency.”</p>\n<p>“But don’t you know how far ahead you can go if merchants know you grab some of these coins?”</p>\n<p>“You tell me.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, these coins weren’t issued by any countries, but they’re valuable. Lots of herbs and ingredients in the black markets can only be bought with these coins...”</p>\n<p><em>...whisper whisper whisper...</em></p>\n<p>Mila approached.</p>\n<p>“Ey, what are you doing?!”</p>\n<p>For some reasons, Shira and Monkey, one of his companions, almost jumped in fright by her barking. Both Mila and Romana behind her saw Shira and Monkey were acting suspicious--but Sneak, the third silhouette, didn’t even try to hide that he was nibbling on something delicious.</p>\n<p>Mila, with a weird face, hissed, “Is that… <em>rendang</em> you guys were eating?”</p>\n<p>“<em>Cough, cough,</em>” hiding the opened wrapping banana leaves, Shira awkwardly trying to make an excuse, “I think Malikh Family is too eager to cut off relationships with our Yashura Family so… I reckon they don’t need this anymore…”</p>\n<p>Mila was so angry she slapped the banana leaves in Shira’s hand.</p>\n<p>“Ah, my rendang…”</p>\n<p>“Your rendang?! You goddamn moron!” Mila hissed, she didn’t dare to roar and announce themselves to other guests. “You’re about to get cuckolded and all you think about is a goddamn rendang?!”</p>\n<p>“Young master, someone trying to get you cuckolded?” licking his fingers for some leftover rendang sauce, Snake asked from the side.</p>\n<p>Shira shook his head. “Cuckold is a very strong word. That girl didn’t even consider me from the beginning. It’s not like we're a married couple yet.”</p>\n<p>He then came to pick the spoiled beef and mourned, “ah… my poor rendang.”</p>\n<p>“Stop crying over that shit! It’s not important!”</p>\n<p>Monkey blurted, “Rendang is not important?”</p>\n<p>Mila glared at Monkey. The monkey-faced peddler closed his mouth as soon as he opened it.</p>\n<p>Romana saw her friend Mila had a bad affinity with her cousin whenever she was angry, thus came to explain from the side, “Young Master Shira, don’t you know people outside the Mossack culture do take engagement seriously? It’s understandable for a young heir of a conservative family like Yashura to not care much about it--but, whatever your feelings regarding your engagement is, if Young Lady Bhela has an affair outside, she’ll also drag down Yashura Family’s reputation. So please be mindful about it more for the sake of your family.”</p>\n<p>They didn’t really think about this deeply since straightforward Mossack people were the type to have children before they were even married. If things went awry, Shira reckoned his uncle and the elders in his family might think the engagement matter was similar to puppy love, about children bantering, but the young generation who was exposed to stories and gossips from books and travellers might think about it differently. And someone who didn’t hang out so much like Shira wouldn’t be able to tell how these youngsters would talk about this incident in the future.</p>\n<p>So Shira stood up and patted his trouser, admitted, “Ah, you’re right, Romana.”</p>\n<p>Mila crossed her arms. Frowning at her cousin. “What are you gonna do now? Fight them? No need to be afraid, I’m with you.”</p>\n<p>Snake, still squatting comfortably, added, “Young Master, my grandfather and my older brother are still here too. You won’t be at a disadvantage in case things go downhill.”</p>\n<p>“It’s decided. Let’s kick their asses!” Mila growled.</p>\n<p>“The heck are you talking about kicking people’s asses in Ngajen Ceremony?” Shira grunted.</p>\n<p>“Then at least let me slap that slut’s arrogant face!”</p>\n<p>Shira shook his head.</p>\n<p>“Let’s go,” he said.</p>\n<p>“We’re gonna slap her face now?” Mila asked.</p>\n<p>“No. We at least have to make Family Yashura’s presence known here,” Shira said. He caught his companions’ confused expressions, so he added, “Everyone is getting excited because most of them are young'uns. But if this incident gets out of the hands, the elders from other families won’t be silent about it.”</p>\n<p>Mila wanted to say something but didn’t after seeing Shira’s relaxed face. She didn’t want to say something silly that’d change the boy’s mind. Therefore, with Shira leading the way, she and her friend Romana went to see the ruckus caused by the noble’s arrival. Leaving Monkey and Sneak who were silent looking at their back.</p>\n<p>The two exchanged glances.</p>\n<p>They looked down, eyes sweeping the ground.</p>\n<p>“Mm?” Monkey mumbled, his hands crawling all over the dirt.</p>\n<p>Snake took out a magic wand. The wand shimmered with a gentle light, then he used that to give some light to the ground where the rendang was spoiled.</p>\n<p>But it was Monkey who shouted in joy, “I got one!”</p>\n<p>“Give me that!” Snake pounced the moment he saw Monkey rubbed the dirt of a piece of rendang.</p>\n<p>Pushing out Snake’s face from grabbing the rendang in his hand, Monkey felt wronged and cried, “Why would a rich gentleman like you fight over a single beef with this poor peddler? Don’t you know my family can only afford to eat beef once a year?”</p>\n<p>“Why, you asked?” Snake sneered, “There’s no need to say the obvious. You don’t get to eat Patriarch Shuro’s handmade rendang everyday! And I’m saying this after starving for beef ever since I’m following you.”</p>\n<p>“Fuck off!”</p>\n<p>“Give me that!”</p>\n<p>“No!”</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the shadowy corner where they were wrestling came to be lightened up with a lit torch.</p>\n<p>“Ehem, you two gentlemen,” a voice called.</p>\n<p>For a moment, Monkey and Snake stopped fighting.</p>\n<p>The voice owner was a man with Malikh Family’s servant uniform. Reluctantly, he continued, “Badril Village locals are usually open-minded and tolerant people. However, we have a bottom line. If you two couldn’t hold it you should rent some inn room or do it in the bushes! Don’t do it in the open, you’re making people uncomfortable! Know some shame!”</p>\n<p>Monkey at first didn’t get what the servant was talking about. Then he realized during infighting over the rendang, he had opened his legs, and Snake was on top of him in a very, very awkward manner.</p>\n<p>“Dammit!” he kicked Snake and trembling over the horror he caught himself in. But suddenly he noticed the rendang in his hand already vanished. He whirled his head around. Snake was already licking his fingers with a satisfied face.</p>\n<p>“Dammit!” Monkey howled again.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The one who enthusiastically greeted the young noble of Blackwood Family was Elder Jhamil instead of Bhela Malikh. He managed to conjure thirty years worth of bullshitting skills to flatter and fawn over the other party, rather thick faced to continue despite the young master of noble family rolled his eyes several times. As soon as the young noble caught the sight of a short-haired girl he immediately escaped from Elder Jhamil’s clutch with a big grin on his face.</p>\n<p>“Ah, Sister Bhela!”</p>\n<p>“Young Master Frane Blackwood.”</p>\n<p>“How are you doing Young Lady Bhela? Fancy to meet you again,” he said as he gifted the girl a flower.</p>\n<p>Bhela received the flower but then immediately passed it to a random maidservant beside her. She said as if it was nothing, “I’m fine. Thank you.”</p>\n<p>Young Master Frane Blackwood smiled wryly. “I’ve been travelling with hardly any rest so that I can see you sooner, my young lady,” the young master of Blackwood Family, Frane Blackwood, said, “may I be so lucky to receive your company tonight?”</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry, but here the words ‘tonight’s companion’ have different meanings than when you say it in the western-style ball--so, no, Young Master Blackwood, I can’t give you company tonight,” she said.</p>\n<p>The young noble still had a smile and wanted to correct his wording, but Bhela suddenly raised her hand and said, “Excuse me.”</p>\n<p>She went past him and greeted another pair of guests instead.</p>\n<p>“Greeting, sir, madam.”</p>\n<p>“It’s about time,” the middle-aged man didn’t answer Bhela’s greeting, but complained instead. “You know the other families had begun their ceremonies, right? Even though we don’t have the same ceremony as your Ngajen Ceremony from the place where I come from, but I know those who don’t take any old ceremonies seriously only brought bad luck over their lands.”</p>\n<p>There was a rare restraint in Bhela’s voice as she replied, “I apologize for our bad conduct, Sir Instructor. I will request the elders to proceed with the ceremony. Please let me lead you toward the reserved spot I previously prepared for both of you.”</p>\n<p>“Lead the way then.”</p>\n<p>Badril Village locals witnessed the valiant Young Lady of Malikh Family taking charge of the Ngajen Ceremony as the Chief Chef, but with the appearance of her bowing to two unfamiliar guests as well, whispers were floating amongst the Ngajen Ceremony guests. Before long, everyone knew that two guests Bhela Malikh greeted were the ones she personally invited, but was neglected before the family’s gate because of the excitement made by the noble’s arrival. Bhela came to them to apologize in person.</p>\n<p>Young Master Frane Blackwood, who felt ignored, pulled a self-decrepitating sneer. He complained to Elder Jhamil instead, “Oh, Malikh Family elder, can you tell me the identity of those two guests who made even Young Lady Bhela to bow her head?”</p>\n<p>“Ehem, ehem,” Elder Jhamil didn’t know what to answer, so he concocted a reply out of thin air, “I think they were relatives from her maternal family.”</p>\n<p>“Is that so? From the way they are dressed, they don’t look from that respectable background enough to get the young lady’s full attention. Don’t you think so?”</p>\n<p>“Young noble is right. Young Lady Bhela’s father once was a gangster thus he didn’t manage to teach common sense to the young lady. I’ll talk to her later to explain what’s really important.”</p>\n<p>After a bit of excuse and fawning, Young Master Blackwood felt this Elder Jhamil was acceptable. He told the Blackwood Family’s servants to bring the gifts he had prepared, which were naturally accepted by Elder Jhamil on the young lady’s behalf. In the meantime, people were disappointed that the drama they were expecting didn’t happen. But what could they do besides shaking their heads and disperse?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Year after year, the ngajen ceremony evolved from stiff sessions of praying ceremony for village safety to the new stylish festivities of foods and happy times for the youngsters, where fads and trends emerge. However big their way of life was changing the conservative major families, Yashura and Elzhier, still pretty much followed the old ways, especially when it came to the prayers. Only Malikh Family amongst the three that eager to embrace the new world that was coming. And by Elder Jhamil’s direction, instead of local shamans, Malikh Family asked help from foreign priests from western orthodox temples from nearby villages to lead the prayer.</p>\n<p>It was all good if one made a progressive decision with the greater good in mind. But here was the problem; orthodox temple priests usually led prayers for abundant harvest, while Ngajen Ceremony was all about calming Selaqs from descending the mountain. These priests probably hadn’t any clue how Selaqs looked like.</p>\n<p>“It was inappropriate for a noble to pray to old Mossack deities they don’t believe in, that was Malikhs’ excuses,'' Mila complained non-stop since they finished praying with other guests. In her hands--like a young mother hugging her baby--were plates of food she had just plundered from Malikh Family’s banquet tables prepared to entertain guests.</p>\n<p>“What deity? Wasn’t the mantra replaced from ancient Mossack prayers to magic spell mantra to calm down Selaq since… I don’t know, fifty years ago?” Romana said. The food in her hands was no less than Mila’s. These two girls seemed to think Malikh Family would regret offending them if they plunder the latter’s prepared feast like no tomorrow.</p>\n<p>“That's what I was saying! We no longer those ancient Mossacks who would sacrifice relatives so Selaqs won’t come down the mountain! Nowadays we’ve been using legit spells to keep all those Selaqs away, and these stupid Malikhs want to change the tradition just to appease some visiting noble? They’d rather avoid their noble guest to be uncomfortable than preventing Selaqs from coming down to chew their stupid brains, hah!”</p>\n<p>Compared to noisy girls beside him, Shira was able to keep his head to his feet. Romana signaled Mila with her eyes when she realized the boy wasn’t so into retaliating against the Malikhs; instead of invading the feast Shira, grabbed Malikh Family’s snacks moderately whenever he could--just like any other normal guests that came here.</p>\n<p>Mila grumbled with a bad mood, faced Shira and said, “Don’t you have something you need to do?”</p>\n<p>“Like what?” Shira hoped this cheeky cousin of his wouldn’t say something about kicking people’s asses again.</p>\n<p>“We can’t wait for something to happen,” she said. “Go ask that bitc--I mean, that fiancée of yours--go ask for a dance. The young’uns are starting to get heated. Look there, one of them couples are dancing. You go join them since that short-haired cunt is your fiancée after all.”</p>\n<p>Mila glanced around for a while before she realized she just had her tongue slipped. She quickly corrected her previous words, “Did I say cunt? I mean short-haired bitch--no, short-haired <em>young lady</em>.”</p>\n<p>“Why don’t you just be honest with yourself here. People have been calling Malikhs much worse here because the foreign priests matter!” Romana laughed.</p>\n<p>At that moment a very young maidservant of Malikh Family just passed by and overheard their conversation. The little maidservant snorted in anger, which made Mila snorted back as a retort.</p>\n<p>“Go, go! Go dance with her!” Mila whispered when she was sure only Shira and Romana were around.</p>\n<p>Shira clicked his tongue. “I don’t even have a single proper conversation with her these past ten years. Why should I go ask her dance out of the blue? Just showing our face around here is enough.”</p>\n<p>“Fool! If she accepted to dance with you then all is good, that would only confirm Malikh Family’s cocky attitude is only because their dipshit brains are getting fried by their own inflated proud ego, nothing serious! But if she ignores you in front of others… heh--she dares!”</p>\n<p>“That’s easy for you to say. If someone you don’t like suddenly asks your hands for a dance, what would you feel later on when you found out refusing means two families become enemies?”</p>\n<p>“Uh-uh, I don’t feel nothing. If he’s my fiancé then it’s my job to go my way out to make it clear in public! Going dancing, going kissing, like a proper damned couple! That’s what the goddamn engagement is all about! Right?”</p>\n<p>Mila ate a cookie and she blinked. Unsure of the previous words she said, she glanced at Romana and murmured, “...right?”</p>\n<p>Romana shrugged.</p>\n<p>But Shira wouldn’t back down easily. He continued arguing, “What if your fiancé is Bony Elzhier, then? Are you going to kiss him to prove he’s your fiancé?”</p>\n<p>Mila hid her gasp.</p>\n<p>“You wanna die?” she pursed her lips. “Listen to me or I’m gonna smack your face!”</p>\n<p>Shira groaned against his cousin’s unreasonableness. But before he could concoct a satisfying retort, Snake and Monkey came out of nowhere.</p>\n<p>“Oh, Young Master Shira,” Monkey came patting him on the shoulder, “it seems you get cuckolded for real this time.”</p>\n<p>People were clapping and whistling as the flashy Young Master Frane Blackwood led Young Lady Bhela Malikh by the hand.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Malikh was entertaining two guests previously, but that bald elder raised a fuss about how she neglected the young noble, so in the end it came to this.”</p>\n<p>Monkey laughed as he teased Shira with his elbow, “They’re going to dance. When two people were dancing in Ngajen Ceremony, that meant they--” he caught the scary experssion on Mila’s face, stopped, “nevermind…”</p>\n<p>“That slut!” Mila hissed.</p>\n<p>This was getting serious. Whenever Mila showed that kind of face something bad would happen. Again, the moment Shira opened his mouth to say something, someone else came to grab him in the shoulder.</p>\n<p>“Brat, your woman is going to cuckold you in public,” said the newcomer, Good-Natured Spirit, who literally came out of the thin air.</p>\n<p>“You too?”</p>\n<p>Shira had a headache. Both Monkey and Snake couldn’t see the annoying Good-Natured Spirit, but the three of them were in harmony in mocking him. They mocked him to the point saying he wouldn’t care would only embarrass him further.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, being led by the hand, Bhela Malikh asked Young Master Blackwood, “What kind of remedy Blackwood Family brought with you?”</p>\n<p>“Why so much in hurry, my young lady?” the young noble gave a laugh and a flash of smile. “No need to worry, Blackwood Family sympathize with the disaster that befell your father, so my mother send me here to personally deliver the medicine Blackwood House had sought far and wide.”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh said nothing more. The Young Master of Blackwood Family pondered as he read the cold expression of the girl, thinking that even with flowers and jewelry gifts, nothing could move this young lady. Such a waste of that beautiful face to not letting a single smile escaped, Young Master Blackwood could only smacked his lips and shook his head. But as soon as he mentioned a medicine he brought for her father, the feisty young lady became amiable almost immediately.</p>\n<p>Good thing for him. Bhela Malikh was talented, the Blackwood Family planned to have her inside their house, and if things went this smoothly he could do that his mother told him sooner than he expected.</p>\n<p>“Little bitch of Malikh Family,” a girl roared, “you finally show your true color you bitch! Is Yashura Family a joke to you?!”</p>\n<p>The furious Mila Yashura became the center of attention. She snorted as she strode, like an angry bull preparing to charge, with the mood that would make the crowd wordlessly give way to her. Not only because they didn’t want anything to do with the infamous young lady of Yashura Family--who, when angry, once punched Bony in the face with a nosebleed--but also because she got a sword in her hands.</p>\n<p>Shira glanced down. His father’s sword he brought with him was gone. He looked again at the unsheated weapon in his cousin’s hands.</p>\n<p>He could only slap his own face the moment he noticed what was happened.</p>\n<p>Mila took a step forward slowly, but her face turned even fiercer. She spoke, “You got guts to bring a lover from outside, eh? I knew something fishy happened when I saw you cut your hair, you little slut.”</p>\n<p>“I cut my hair because it got in the way during my training,” Bhela replied plainly. “And this is not my lover. Just a relative of my friend.”</p>\n<p>“You lying little slut. As if someone like you have any friends!”</p>\n<p>“I do have a friend.” Bhela said. A rare emphasizing tone in her voice was telling that she was upset, but she held back from explaining further.</p>\n<p>“I don’t care what your excuse is! Do you think I don’t know what you shitty Malikhs up to? You already don’t put Yashura Family in your eyes, eh? Just because you bitch have a little vacation outside, eh? If you think you’re a big shot, why don’t you prove it here and now?!”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh was silent for a while. Looking at Mila, she then asked, “And what are you suggesting I should do, Young Lady Yashura?”</p>\n<p>Mila stabbed her sword into the ground.</p>\n<p>“I just want to know how awesome is this Archer class you’ve got overseas that makes you Malikhs stop putting us Yashuras in your eyes,” Mila sneered. “Why don’t we test it with my sword, eh? Let’s do a duel, bitch.”</p>\n<p>Bhela just looked at Mila strangely.</p>\n<p>“But you’re a Specialist class,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Aha! Getting scared, aren’t ya, you little cunt?”</p>\n<p>Bhela didn’t want to argue with her. So she told the nearest servant to go grab a bow.</p>\n<p>On the other side, Monkey anxiously elbowed Shira, said, “Should I drag your cousin back?”</p>\n<p>“Stand down, mister. Mila is the one who’s starting it. She can’t afford to back down now.”</p>\n<p>Beside them Snake was nodding as he understood what Shira meant.</p>\n<p>Then with a laugh, Good-Natured Spirit, who was already tired jeering him, said to Shira. “Kid, shit just got real. Ain’t that a good idea to pull her before it’s too late?”</p>\n<p>Shira wanted to but he couldn’t. He knew exactly Mila’s strength. Fighting bare hands, she might get a chance to stand against the strongest youngster in the village, but it would become a different story when weapons and mana were involved.</p>\n<p>Since Mila was the one to propose the duel, bailing out before the fight began would be slapping her own face in front of the guests. It was a bad idea, because Mila didn’t appear to have the slightest chance to win. So bad that it’d be more reasonable to just surrender. But Shira knew Mila hated to go back on her words the most. Thus he silently moved closer to her, prepared to pull her back in before the situation really got out of his hands.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Young Master Blackwood, was pulled out by an adjutant of his family.</p>\n<p>Smirking, he asked the adjutant, “Who is that girl who picking a fight with Bhela?”</p>\n<p>“Seems like the eldest young lady of that family,” the adjutant replied.</p>\n<p>“You mean the family my Bhela got engaged to?” Young Master Frane Blackwood asked as if Bhela already his. The corner of his lips curled as he thought this might be a good chance to do something on the engagement that Blackwood House already saw as a thorn in their eyes. “Do you have something on that girl?”</p>\n<p>“Replying to young master, since Yashura Family is the main obstacle for us to get Young Lady Bhela Malikh to our side, your mother has already sent someone to investigate them. The eldest young lady of Yashura Family merely a Level 10 Specialist class who just graduated from Novice about seven months ago.”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood couldn’t help but chuckle. Even though the two young ladies had the same level, a Specialist merely support class that wasn’t suited in combat. This duel affair would turn out to be a joke.</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood scoffed. “Let my Bhela teach her some manners. I don’t want anyone to disturb us after this.”</p>\n<p>“Young master,” the adjutant lowered his voice, “I don’t think that’s a good idea.”</p>\n<p>“What’s on your mind, adjutant?”</p>\n<p>“I just made a round to check the guests attending this ceremony, and I found…”--he lowered his voice--“...some spectators amongst the guests that shouldn’t have be here….”</p>\n<p>“Go on,” the young noble urged.</p>\n<p>“I just received the word, young master, there are experts that Elder Jhamil said he didn’t invite.”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood frowned. “What… what’s that supposed to mean?”</p>\n<p>On the less crowded place of the courtyard, the middle-aged man who Bhela greeted before, along with the middle-aged woman, watched the commotion unfold while nibbling on steamed peanuts. He glanced at the other place where a man calmly sipping tea, a man with a hard face who couldn’t hide his sharp aura, then swept his gaze at the one who beside him, a short stature man who wore a headband to hide his reddish hair from public, who also happened to enjoy steamed peanuts while his focus solely at one direction in the crowd.</p>\n<p>All of them came in common garments incognito. But still Elder Jhamil sent people to keep tabs on them, especially since the bald elder still didn’t know the reason Bhela Malikh invited these foreigners.</p>\n<p>The ngajen ceremony usually consisted of three main parts--prayer, socializing, and sending offerings to the mountain as the finale. It was uncommon for irrelevant events to happen between them. However, since the young lady of the host had already accepted the duel, Malikh Family set up an emergency venue for the fight.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil came to invite himself as the judge. For a change to hummiliate those simple Yashuras and to slip himself onto the spotlight, he couldn’t ask for better opportunity.</p>\n<p>“You two ready?” Elder Jhamil asked both of the opposing sides. “This is a friendly match between two friendly families. So stop before your blade hit your enemy,” he said, seemingly talking to either sides, but didn’t say anything about the arrows part.</p>\n<p>Since Bhela Malikh was an Archer, she suggested to Mila, “I’m using a bow. So you can move first. I’ll try to dodge for ten seconds.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t need that,” Mila scoffed.</p>\n<p>“Very well…” she said. She glanced at Elder Jhamil, said, “Elder Jhamil, please begin the duel.&quot;</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil counted to three.</p>\n<p>The duel began.</p>\n<p>“AAAAAA!!!” Mila roared with the sword raised above her head, charging ahead.</p>\n<p>Contrast to her opponent’s battle cry, Bhela was solemn. She picked four arrows from the quiver tied on her hips. Nocking the arrows simultaneously, she took a deep breath as she concentrated to channel different natures elemental mana from her manasphere. The mana, through fingers and her thumb, flowing into all the four arrows and soon the tip of the arrows glowed with four different colors.</p>\n<p>The wind began to stir.</p>\n<p>And she raised the bow. She released the arrows.</p>\n<p><em>Fuuush fuuuushhh fuuushh shhuuuuusshh!</em></p>\n<p>Before even everyone noticed what happened, the mana Bhela channeled melted the flying arrows, within a span of milliseconds, turning them into dangerous magic projectiles of four elemental natures--fire, water, wind and lightning.</p>\n<p>Mila was confident before. She knew a trick against an Archer, but here she was dumbfounded by magic arrows coming to blast her way. She thought she was fighting an Archer, but got up against a Mage instead. This wasn’t what she signed up for.</p>\n<p><em>Clank!</em></p>\n<p>The first blue arrow dissapeared almost the moment it reached Mila. The sound of metallic clash that followed the said arrow resounded three more times, and the three arrows left behind too disappeared almost immediately. Mila, thought she ought to dodge the magic arrows, leap a step backward, but her hasty movement combined with the slippery mud made her slipped her foothold, accidentally fell to her butt instead.</p>\n<p>Bhela aimed down her bow. Everyone was staring at her with complicated and questioning gaze, as an Archer who could do magic, this was the first time everyone witnessed it.</p>\n<p>“It’s a four elemental affinity spell!” someone’s voice roared through the silenced venue, “I heard it, I doubted it, but she really did it!”</p>\n<p>Everyone looked at his way, the man who shouted, and saw that it was the middle-aged man whom Bhela invited from outside the village. He sat eating steamed peanuts then, now he was standing perplexed.</p>\n<p>Bhela, realizing that the man was the center of the attention, and bow to him from afar.</p>\n<p>“She really did it…” the man said under his breath.</p>\n<p>Someone who sat beside him said, “Sure she did, the only one right now--I guess now that you big brain from Elemental Stone School witnessed it I guess you can die without regret?”</p>\n<p>The man looked at the woman who accompanied him, he said still with expression of disbelieve, “It’s a four elemental affinity spell…”</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, you already said that.”</p>\n<p>The last and the most famous multi elemental Unique Class was, a mage with three elemental affinity skills, died of old age--was actually the headmaster of Elemental Stone School from seventy years ago. As a scholar and a mage researching deeply in topics of elemental mana all of his career, how could he didn’t know the value of a Unique Class who surpassed even the ex-headmaster of his school?</p>\n<p>“I can’t believe someone without a Mage Unique Class really did it…”</p>\n<p>“The most promising talent of this generation, alright, the first time I witnessed an Archer could do magic,” the woman said. “Good thing she stopped her arrows then--if not, the other girl would ended up so pitiful.”</p>\n<p>As the woman said that, someone else blurted not far away from there.</p>\n<p>“She didn’t stop it.”</p>\n<p>“Pardon? Sir Kurusiya?” the woman asked.</p>\n<p>The one she was talking to was the quiet man with sharp aura. He said as a matter of fact like tone, “She didn’t stop it. Someone else did,” he sipped his tea, and when the woman still confused, he explained with hoarse voice, “those are magic, but they were still arrows shot from a bow. You can’t stop flying arrows. That girl calculated and slightly missed her aim as to not hurting her opponent. But she didn’t plan to stop it.”</p>\n<p>The woman questioned him, “If she wasn’t the one who stopped it, then would you know why the arrows disappears?”</p>\n<p>The man put down his glass of tea. “I don’t know. Why you ask me? Ask that fool there who’s been grinning all the time.”</p>\n<p>The woman, along with the middle-aged man from Stone Elemental School, looked up to the bearded foreigner.</p>\n<p>“She’s not the one who stopped it,” the bearded man said with a smile.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Mila, who mellowed from her defeat and still sat on the muddy ground, gulped as she saw her cousin come to pick her up.</p>\n<p>“I lost,” she said to Shira.</p>\n<p>“No you didn’t, that girl is the one who put down her bow first, and you still got your swords in your hands--so technically you’d win.”</p>\n<p>“I fell to my butt, I was humiliated,” Mila said, her voice trembled, “I lost….”</p>\n<p>Shira sighed. He grabbed Mila’s hand and pulled her up. “It’s adult problems from hereon, Uncle Shuro would likely summon my father back. For now, let’s get out of here,” he said.</p>\n<p>Monkey and Snake, along with the nervous Romana, came to follow them from behind to shield them from people’s laughter. Mila was so humiliated the usually feisty tomboy was so down she couldn’t afford to hold her head straight. As Shira witnessed how pitiful his cousin was, regret overwhelming him when he remembered how he was holding back from taking action himself.</p>\n<p>“Brat,” someone called him.</p>\n<p>Shira turned his head. It was Good-Natured Spirit.</p>\n<p>“You owe me this time,” the Nalaq said.</p>\n<p>Shira nodded.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>“Hear ye hear ye people! Gather around and hear me announce something incredible, people! Gather around, will ya!”</p>\n<p>Standing on top of a table, Elder Jhamil shouted to gather people, announcing something that the Young Master of Blackwood Family passed him beforehands. “Although winner of the duel is Young Lady Bhela, Young Master Frane of Blackwood House is concerned by some stupid unruly girl of the supposed biggest family in Badril Village behavior would smear my young lady--”</p>\n<p>“Big news! Big news!” someone else’s shouting cut off Elder Jhamil’s announcement, “Young Master Bonithon is running around beating people! Watch your mouth if you don’t want get beaten for no reason!”</p>\n<p>“Bony is going crazy! He’s going to kick people’s asses! Nobody knows why!”</p>\n<p>“What the fuck is going on! Why Elzhier Family messing with us Malikhs now?”</p>\n<p>At the chaotic scene before him, Elder Jhamil’s face showed a frown and a hint of hesitation. He then cleared his phlegm anyway, trying to get people’s attention, then pushed on announcing carefully, “Young Master Frane Blackwood is concerned that--”</p>\n<p>“Elder Jhamil!!” a servant came running with a horrified expression, “Bony is coming for you, run away!”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil pointed his finger at the servant and roared, “What is that brat from Elzhier Family wants to do with me! Go kick him out, I’m trying to tell everybody something important here!”</p>\n<p>“But he doesn’t listen to reasons! He’s going to punch your face, is what he said just now!”</p>\n<p>“Imbecile! Do you think a young master would jump around like a monkey and punch an elder of another family in the damn face?! He’s making ruckus. Go on, kick him out!”</p>\n<p>Looking at the crowd from the rushedly made stage, he then smiled and continued, “Right, everybody, it’s Young Master of Blackwood Family; what I’m saying is that since Young Lady Bhela Malikh is winning with ease against the foolish young lady of <em>that</em> family, Young Master Blackwood concerned that some people would shrug my young lady’s victory. So he proposed, in order to make it clear the disparity between Malikh and--sheesh--Yashura, he proposed that him as a friendly representative of Malikh Family and Shira Yashura as the repre--”</p>\n<p>“Elder Jhamil--watch out!”</p>\n<p>He had it taking from lowly servants who cut off his announcement. Fuming in anger, Elder Jhamil pointed his finger toward the one who was spriting toward him and roared, “How many times I told you to just kick him out! Shut your trap and go kick the damned brat!”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was losing his cool. But what he failed to realize in time was that the one who sprinted toward him wasn’t a servant from his family. It was not the one who telling him to run away. And before he knew it, someone leaped up on the table where he was standing and delivered a punch to the face.</p>\n<p>“Gaaahhh!”</p>\n<p>Even after Elder Jhamil stumbled down the table he stood on, his assaulter didn’t plan to let him go. And what came after that was a torrent of hardened fist, pummeling his face even though he screamed for mercy. Only when the chaotic crowd succeeded in saving him did Elder Jhamil see the assaulter’s face--it was indeed the Young Master from Elzhier Family.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Bonithon… what did you… why did you do this… for what reason?!” Elder Jhamil choked out his grievance.</p>\n<p>Bony, the man who beat the bald elder black and blue, replied with nothing but a cold stare. Instead, it was an almost incoherent voice of Pilek who answered instead.</p>\n<p>“Kekekek, don’t be angry Elder Baldy! We just discussed how you were a splendid Pugilist a long time ago, so Boss Bony came here to find out whether it was true or not! That’s why he asked you to a barehand duel!” Pilek came in with a swagger and a bottle of booze in his hand. From a single glance anybody could tell he was drunk.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s lips trembled. What duel? That brat just leaped out of nowhere without saying anything, then immediately beating him black and blue!</p>\n<p>The only one from the three delinquents who hadn’t had the smell of liquor from his body was Polio. He wore an apologetic smile, and with a slight sigh, he said, “Please forgive them, dear kind Malikh sirs, my friends are terrible when they are drunk.”</p>\n<p>Polio made a round to apologize to any Malikhs he saw. But the Malikh Family didn’t appreciate his gesture, receiving jeerings in return.</p>\n<p>Polio was a patient young man, but Pilek wasn’t. The drunk Pilek didn’t take their attitude kindly, randomly walking to a servant, said, “Hah? What the fuck are you staring me at, you no-name Malikh servant? Wanna die, eh? Huuuraah!!!”</p>\n<p><em>Shatter!</em></p>\n<p>Without a warning he swung the booze in his hand to a Malikh family servant. The man he attacked stumbled backward holding his bloodied head from the crash Pilek gave him.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Bhela Malikh had just settled greeting four foreign guests that she invited from outside, and was on her way to fetch cuisines from the kitchen to humor her guests, then she witnessed the chaotic brawl unfold with a crowdful of cheers and jeers mixed in between. Perhaps there were more than a dozen men involved, with the Malikhs servants, guards, common family members even an elder came along to surround Bony and his two underlings.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela…” a little maidservant with a crest of Elzhier Family in her uniform bowed to Bhela politely.</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at her. She returned the bow even though the other party clearly was a servant. “Miss Elzhier,” she spoke softly.</p>\n<p>“No need to be polite to this servant, Young Lady.”</p>\n<p>“I can’t be impolite to Sister Ryntia’s friends.”</p>\n<p>The Elzhier Family maidservant smiled. Since Bhela insisted, then she wouldn’t be bowing her head anymore.</p>\n<p>She said, “Eldest Young Lady sends me to ask for your forgiveness for her brother’s brashness, Young Lady Bhela.”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at the brawl that started in her family’s courtyard. This chaos would spell imperfect on tonight's Malikh Family’s Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>“There’s no need for that. Since I accepted Young Lady Mila Yashura’s duel then I somewhat anticipated Young Master Bonithon will follow suit to make trouble tonight. If anything, it is I the one who should apologize to Sister Ryntia because I couldn’t handle the situation well. Please tell her that I’ll try to maintain friendship between Malikh and Elzhier Family.”</p>\n<p>Still with the serene smile on her face, the Elzhier Family maidservant studied the expression on Bhela’s face. She spoke a moment after, “Then I’ll let Eldest Young Lady Elzhier knows by tomorrow.”</p>\n<p>“Thanks,” Bhela offered her gratitude with a bow.</p>\n<p>By this time, the brawl became anything but intensified, as men either from Elzhier Family or thugs that previously had dealings with Bony’s group came in to reinforce the Elzhier young master. Before the Malikhs could pressure the intruders with numbers, but then the completely overwhelmed by the new reinforcement.</p>\n<p>“Huurraaahh!” Pilek sent a Malikh man flying with his kick. “Where the fuck your previous cocky taunt? Cat got your tongue, eh?”</p>\n<p>The only unspoken rules in brawls were strictly no usage of mana and spell as well as no sharp objects to use as weapons. But when it was chaotic and nobody could watch everybody the sharpest mind with tricks the one who prevailed--this is why the likes of Pilek and his friend Polio who always struck in place people wouldn’t be willing the one who were taking the advantage in brawls. Even hunters and seasoned guards were no match against these naughty brats.</p>\n<p>For example, when Pilek’s punch was blocked by Elder Jhamil’s son, “You shitty brat, just wait till I deal with your father--kuukgghh!”</p>\n<p>And because no one was watching, Pilek used his knee to strike the cocky young elder in the balls.</p>\n<p>With a sad whimper from his trembling lips, Elder Jhamil’s son curled onto the ground holding his precious balls that Polio struck.</p>\n<p>Seeing that a family elder was mercilessly defeated, a few Malikhs came to avenge their young elder. By then, Pilek already had Polio watching over his back.</p>\n<p>At that point, no Malikhs could match them in hand-in-hand brawl.</p>\n<p>A stranger then casually walked in. Pilek stopped, looking at him, and amidst the chaotic scene it took a while for him to find out that the man was actually a foreigner--an eastern Kaya man. The man had a sheathed sword on his hips. But Pilek wasn’t afraid as long as he stick with the brawl rules to use only fighting unarmed.</p>\n<p>“Huurraaah!”</p>\n<p>Pilek threw a feint. Most simple Malikhs would fall for this. But the eastern Kaya man didn’t budge. Seemed to even anticipate it. With a movement too fast for Pilek to follow the man grabbed his wrist, flicked him and sent him into the air like it was nothing.</p>\n<p>It was only after Pilek rolled in the mud he realized what had happened.</p>\n<p>The man then glanced aside and walked toward Polio who in his own right was too engrossed with the brawl. With his left hand pushing Polio’s shoulder and the other hand grabbing his wrist, he flipped Polio just like he did Pilek beforehand.</p>\n<p>Pilek and a few others that the man previously flipped were amazed by how effortlessly the man disabling enthusiastic young men from fighting.</p>\n<p>The sword handle the man had was wrapped with cloth and its body too thin for regular blades. Those who noticed this would understand that the man wasn’t an ordinary Kaya. Polio was one of them.</p>\n<p>“A Samurai!” he exclaimed a moment after he got thrown onto the muddy ground.</p>\n<p>The Kaya man stopped, looking at him, then spoke with a displeased tone, “I am but a masterless ronin.”</p>\n<p>The man then continued walking toward a different direction.</p>\n<p>Bony was fighting with three men alone, so he couldn’t afford to look around. He didn’t realize the Kaya man at first, but when the man tried to grab the wild young master’s wrist, Bony reacted--he reacted by throwing a punch to the man’s face.</p>\n<p>The man slapped his flying fist from the side, tremendously muffled its momentum. Again, he tried to grab Bony’s wrist and his shoulder. Bony tried resisting but the man’s speed was too fast for him to compete.</p>\n<p>As the man prepared to flip him, Bony felt a faint gush of the wind from his legs. It didn’t take him a second to realize the man just putting his hand on his shoulder as a feint--his real target was to gently nudge his foot on rooting from the ground, which, if he’d focus his effort to get his shoulder free from the man’s grasp, a small window of opening that could be used by his opponent to disrupt his sense of balance. Thus Bony firmly stomped his feet to the ground instead. He grabbed the man’s sleeve to make his opponent not be able to easily throw like Pilek and Polio.</p>\n<p>Responding to Bony’s choice, the man curled the corner of his lips. Bony caught a hint of taunt when he staring the man in the eyes.</p>\n<p>“Kkuuuggghh!”</p>\n<p>Bony did succeed in preventing himself get flipped to the ground. But he got struck in the gut instead.</p>\n<p>The man didn’t let him go. The moment Bony stepping backward due to shock having stricken, the man was charging and got his wrist in the blink of the eyes--what happened afterward was Bony got his feet swept and he completely lost his ground, and got cheered by his friends as the last man who got thrown into the mud.</p>\n<p>Bony then sat there looking as the fight stopped; since someone took him down, more and less the Malikhs had won the brawl.</p>\n<p>“Aren’t you Thoqek’s son?” the Kaya man asked Bony.</p>\n<p>Bony wasn’t willing to open his mouth when his father’s name got mentioned.</p>\n<p>Receiving no answer, the man thus carelessly said, “Unexpectedly, you’ve got more guts than your father. Get up now, and stop making trouble in Ghalim Malikh’s home.”</p>\n<p>The young ruffians with Bony as the leader naturally wouldn’t be arrogant anymore since they had been defeated. They retreated calmly, and the Malikhs didn’t dare taunt them the second time in case Bony would change his mind and started on a rampage again. In the end, the real reason why Bony came targeting Malikh Family, as many people knew, was that he wasn’t a drinker that would lose reason to punch another family’s elder in the face.</p>\n<p>Speaking about an elder who got a punch in the face; after Bony and others were gone, Elder Jhamil showed his nose out of his hiding place. He gritted his teeth. He swore he’d use his full resource to get back from Bony’s father in the next village council meeting.</p>\n<p>“Elder Jhamil, you still haven’t announced the thing I ask you to do,” from behind, the sullen young noble Frane Blackwood said to him.</p>\n<p>“Y-young Master Blackwood, please spare me--the mood isn’t that good to draw people’s attention after that kid crashing our Ngajen Ceremony just now. How about I brief it to other village leaders tomorrow in the village council meeting?”</p>\n<p>“No, I want everyone to know it by tonight. This is the right time and the right place to announce it. Besides, I want to see what kind of a young man the one who’s supposed to be my rival.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil didn’t want to show his beaten face to the crowd tonight. But as much as he love his face he knew flattery wouldn’t get him out of this situation--at least not if he didn’t want to offend the young noble. And so with a heavy face he climbed the table once again, hiding off his reluctancy.</p>\n<p>Someone heartily made a joke on him, “Elder Jhamil, we thought you’re a man who care about face the most--I don’t expect you to boldly show how handsome you’ve become now!”</p>\n<p>“Kids nowadays getting big headed by their privileges as young masters--naturally I’ll let their fathers know how to discipline their brats!” Elder Jhamil coldly said. “Anyway, you all know that my Young Lady Bhela is a girl with talent and her future is boundless. Here in Malikh Family we’re not willing to throw our princess to cow’s dunk that is Yashura Family’s trash young master. And our friend Young Noble Frane Blackwood also thinks the same!”</p>\n<p>Such passionate speech, naturally people were cheering in anticipation of the next spectacle they thought they were going to witness.</p>\n<p>Getting the cue from Elder Jhamil, Frane Blackwood came forward with a swagger. “I speak this as a close friend of Young Lady Bhela Malikh. Someone with the name of Shira Yashura; if you think you’re worthy of her, do you dare to prove it by having a duel with me?!”</p>\n<p>The crowd was silent. They were waiting for the reply.</p>\n<p>Frane Blackwood swept the crowd with his eyes.</p>\n<p>Someone said to him the boy he challenged was utter trash. He was amused guessing how this trash would respond to his duel challenge, especially when Bhela Malikh had just completely defeated the cheeky young lady from his family.</p>\n<p>There were already murmurs spreading. People were also curious whether Shira was going to accept or run away from it.</p>\n<p>And then…</p>\n<p>“<em>Cough, cough…</em>” someone awkwardly stepped forward with a wry smile plastered on his face. People recognized his face, which looked like a monkey, and many of them had seen him together with Shira Yashura.</p>\n<p>He was Monkey. He said, “This young noble… about your proposed duel… I’m afraid Young Master Shira Yashura can’t answer it tonight.”</p>\n<p>Frane Blackwood laughed. “Why? He’s scared? His cousin challenged Young Lady Bhela to a duel for no apparent reason; don’t tell me we can do the same to them?”</p>\n<p>“No, it’s not that.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil pointed his finger at Monkey. “We all know Shira Yashura is a trash who can’t even advance to Level 4 Novice! Young Master Frane Blackwood is kind. Tonight, he’s going to give Shira one chance to admit that he’s unworthy of Young Lady Bhela Malikh to the crowd here. He does that, and there will be no need for Young Master Frane Blackwood to embarrass him by kicking his ass!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, but he can’t give you an answer tonight,” Monkey insisted.</p>\n<p>Now it was Elder Jhamil who laughed. “He’s really scared facing Young Master Frane right now?!”</p>\n<p>“No…”</p>\n<p>“Then why?”</p>\n<p>Monkey sighed.</p>\n<p>“Because he’s already gone home!”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was furious. The whole point he had to gather people even though his face had been beaten by Bony was to call out the boy and embarrass him in public, as per the young noble request. But the said person himself already went home, so Elder Jhamil standing on top of the table was for nothing.</p>\n<p>Immediately he ordered a servant to send the message to Yashura Family, while in between, cursing the fact that he didn’t get the chance to distract the guests from discussing the previous brawl. Sure enough, not only the people were talking about Bhela Malikh’s hidden Unique Class, they were also talking about Bony, and people he beat to pulp, especially Elder Jhamil. People no longer cared to gossip about Young Lady Mila Yashura who had been sent home defeated, but they laughed at someone present who had just his misfortune like Elder Jhamil instead.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil had lost his face in the end. Literally and metaphorically.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, with a solemn expression Monkey looked at his partner Snake who was enjoying the banquet and had amused himself watching the spectacle previously.</p>\n<p>Monkey said with a whisper, “Why the hell your family doesn’t show his face when they dumping shit to Young Master and Young Lady Yashura just now?!”</p>\n<p>Snake glanced at him lazily. “I don’t know. They said they were going to diagnose Patriarch Ghalim Malikh previously.”</p>\n<p>“Can’t you just fetch your brother instead? Didn’t you put your words to assure young master before this? What if he thinks we’re people who put our words lightly?”</p>\n<p>“The one who’s diagnosing the patriarch is my grandfather, my brother supposed to be free enough to be a busybody just now,” Snake said, displeased by Monkey’s tone accusing him of being unloyal to his own word.</p>\n<p>Actually, he also confused why his brother didn’t show his nose when Young Lady Mila recklessly brought a sword to challenge Bhela to a duel. From his understanding of his brother’s character and the relationship between his family and Yashura from what he knew told him that more or less his brother was going to back Yashura if the drama with Malikh Family intensified. But he didn’t. Snake would barge into Malikh Family’s doors to look for his grandfather if he knew it was going to be like this instead.</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-3/chapter-4":"<p>Badril Village, though had been two years passed without her presence, was the same as always for Bhela Malikh. She hadn’t that many acquaintances her age she could consider friendly before. In spite of that, from the day she returned, people act as if they were her rekindled childhood friends she never knew she had.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” a daughter of an elder from Elzhier Family asked curiously, “is the rumor about that story true?”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at her with eyelids half-closed.</p>\n<p>“Which rumor?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, silly you, of course <em>that</em> rumor! The one about your romance with a blue blood noble!”</p>\n<p>Giggles of girls followed after the girl’s words. When Bhela returned to Badril Village she brought not only fame and reputation, but interesting stories and rumors as well. She was currently surrounded by curious young ladies who sought for exciting gossip.</p>\n<p>“Yeah, yeah!” another girl excitedly hussing in low voice. “I heard he’ll attend Malikh’s ngajen ceremony tonight!”</p>\n<p>“Really?”</p>\n<p>“Why else would Young Lady Bhela take the Chef Chief position if she didn’t expect for her lover to come tonight? He’ll come for sure!”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, yeah, everybody is saying Young Lady Bhela doing just for that!”</p>\n<p>Bhela found it was amazing how people could conjure their own rumors despite not seeing the true story by their own eyes.</p>\n<p>And just when the young ladies started getting excited discussing Young Lady Bhela’s ‘love life’, a vigorous shout resounded the courtyard announcing that Blackwood Family had arrived.</p>\n<p>“Blackwood Family?” someone cocked their head and looked over the direction of the gate. “What kind of family is so bold announcing their names in other family’s ngajen ceremony? Not even Village Head’s Elzhier Family would do to the ceremony host!”</p>\n<p>“Only foreigners to be that stupid to be rude in big family like Malikh! If this is my place I’d send a guard to kick their ass out as soon as possible!”</p>\n<p>“Look over there! Malikh Family elders are rushing to the gate! Let’s check out how’s Malikhs going to deal with it!”</p>\n<p>Curious guests were tailing the elders to see some commotion they thought would occur. However, not only did the Malikhs not make a fuss over it, they even bowed their heads toward the newly arrived noble as if they were servants greeting their returning master. Young people were overly excited because nobles were foreign and appeared in stories all of their lives.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Mila, who already went back with her friend, was gritting teeth with anger. Beside her Romana was holding the tomboy back, though concerned she didn't say a word.</p>\n<p>“Why should I am the one who always had to hold myself back?” Mila hissed in a low voice as if she was wronged.</p>\n<p>“Look around and think about who’s receiving the blow the most. Everyone’s talking about your cousin right now--do you want to make it worse for him?”</p>\n<p>After hearing her friend’s warning, Mila began to take a deep breath and think things through. Romana was right. When she opened her ears Mila could hear people comparing the young master of this noble Blackwood Family with her cousin Shira. They compared such a gallant-looking young noble with a trash of Yashura Family young master, adding with their own biased seasoning here and there, making her cousin Shira look really bad. Mila trembled as her face boiled red from holding back her anger.</p>\n<p>“Where’s Shira right now?”</p>\n<p>“I think he went hiding!” Romana said.</p>\n<p>“Hiding?! He’s embarrassed to show his face that much?”</p>\n<p>After circling around a bit, Mila found the boy’s silhouette in the shadow far from the braziers' light. There, he was squatting, hiding along with two other silhouettes who were also squatting in a suspicious manner.</p>\n<p>“Now, young master, where the hell did you get this coin?” someone whispered from the suspicious bunch.</p>\n<p>The reply came also in the same hushed manner. “Don’t ask me now, just know I’ve got a few more hidden in my house. I can’t move my family, but if you’re fine with this, I can invest in your goods earlier.”</p>\n<p>“We’re fine? Of course we’re fine! Don’t you know how amazing this coin is?”</p>\n<p>“It’s amazing? I can’t even buy satays with this. Nobody here would receive unfamiliar currency.”</p>\n<p>“But don’t you know how far ahead you can go if merchants know you grab some of these coins?”</p>\n<p>“You tell me.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, these coins weren’t issued by any countries, but they’re valuable. Lots of herbs and ingredients in the black markets can only be bought with these coins...”</p>\n<p><em>...whisper whisper whisper...</em></p>\n<p>Mila approached.</p>\n<p>“Ey, what are you doing?!”</p>\n<p>For some reasons, Shira and Monkey, one of his companions, almost jumped in fright by her barking. Both Mila and Romana behind her saw Shira and Monkey were acting suspicious--but Sneak, the third silhouette, didn’t even try to hide that he was nibbling on something delicious.</p>\n<p>Mila, with a weird face, hissed, “Is that… <em>rendang</em> you guys were eating?”</p>\n<p>“<em>Cough, cough,</em>” hiding the opened wrapping banana leaves, Shira awkwardly trying to make an excuse, “I think Malikh Family is too eager to cut off relationships with our Yashura Family so… I reckon they don’t need this anymore…”</p>\n<p>Mila was so angry she slapped the banana leaves in Shira’s hand.</p>\n<p>“Ah, my rendang…”</p>\n<p>“Your rendang?! You goddamn moron!” Mila hissed, she didn’t dare to roar and announce themselves to other guests. “You’re about to get cuckolded and all you think about is a goddamn rendang?!”</p>\n<p>“Young master, someone trying to get you cuckolded?” licking his fingers for some leftover rendang sauce, Snake asked from the side.</p>\n<p>Shira shook his head. “Cuckold is a very strong word. That girl didn’t even consider me from the beginning. It’s not like we're a married couple yet.”</p>\n<p>He then came to pick the spoiled beef and mourned, “ah… my poor rendang.”</p>\n<p>“Stop crying over that shit! It’s not important!”</p>\n<p>Monkey blurted, “Rendang is not important?”</p>\n<p>Mila glared at Monkey. The monkey-faced peddler closed his mouth as soon as he opened it.</p>\n<p>Romana saw her friend Mila had a bad affinity with her cousin whenever she was angry, thus came to explain from the side, “Young Master Shira, don’t you know people outside the Mossack culture do take engagement seriously? It’s understandable for a young heir of a conservative family like Yashura to not care much about it--but, whatever your feelings regarding your engagement is, if Young Lady Bhela has an affair outside, she’ll also drag down Yashura Family’s reputation. So please be mindful about it more for the sake of your family.”</p>\n<p>They didn’t really think about this deeply since straightforward Mossack people were the type to have children before they were even married. If things went awry, Shira reckoned his uncle and the elders in his family might think the engagement matter was similar to puppy love, about children bantering, but the young generation who was exposed to stories and gossips from books and travellers might think about it differently. And someone who didn’t hang out so much like Shira wouldn’t be able to tell how these youngsters would talk about this incident in the future.</p>\n<p>So Shira stood up and patted his trouser, admitted, “Ah, you’re right, Romana.”</p>\n<p>Mila crossed her arms. Frowning at her cousin. “What are you gonna do now? Fight them? No need to be afraid, I’m with you.”</p>\n<p>Snake, still squatting comfortably, added, “Young Master, my grandfather and my older brother are still here too. You won’t be at a disadvantage in case things go downhill.”</p>\n<p>“It’s decided. Let’s kick their asses!” Mila growled.</p>\n<p>“The heck are you talking about kicking people’s asses in Ngajen Ceremony?” Shira grunted.</p>\n<p>“Then at least let me slap that slut’s arrogant face!”</p>\n<p>Shira shook his head.</p>\n<p>“Let’s go,” he said.</p>\n<p>“We’re gonna slap her face now?” Mila asked.</p>\n<p>“No. We at least have to make Family Yashura’s presence known here,” Shira said. He caught his companions’ confused expressions, so he added, “Everyone is getting excited because most of them are young'uns. But if this incident gets out of the hands, the elders from other families won’t be silent about it.”</p>\n<p>Mila wanted to say something but didn’t after seeing Shira’s relaxed face. She didn’t want to say something silly that’d change the boy’s mind. Therefore, with Shira leading the way, she and her friend Romana went to see the ruckus caused by the noble’s arrival. Leaving Monkey and Sneak who were silent looking at their back.</p>\n<p>The two exchanged glances.</p>\n<p>They looked down, eyes sweeping the ground.</p>\n<p>“Mm?” Monkey mumbled, his hands crawling all over the dirt.</p>\n<p>Snake took out a magic wand. The wand shimmered with a gentle light, then he used that to give some light to the ground where the rendang was spoiled.</p>\n<p>But it was Monkey who shouted in joy, “I got one!”</p>\n<p>“Give me that!” Snake pounced the moment he saw Monkey rubbed the dirt of a piece of rendang.</p>\n<p>Pushing out Snake’s face from grabbing the rendang in his hand, Monkey felt wronged and cried, “Why would a rich gentleman like you fight over a single beef with this poor peddler? Don’t you know my family can only afford to eat beef once a year?”</p>\n<p>“Why, you asked?” Snake sneered, “There’s no need to say the obvious. You don’t get to eat Patriarch Shuro’s handmade rendang everyday! And I’m saying this after starving for beef ever since I’m following you.”</p>\n<p>“Fuck off!”</p>\n<p>“Give me that!”</p>\n<p>“No!”</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the shadowy corner where they were wrestling came to be lightened up with a lit torch.</p>\n<p>“Ehem, you two gentlemen,” a voice called.</p>\n<p>For a moment, Monkey and Snake stopped fighting.</p>\n<p>The voice owner was a man with Malikh Family’s servant uniform. Reluctantly, he continued, “Badril Village locals are usually open-minded and tolerant people. However, we have a bottom line. If you two couldn’t hold it you should rent some inn room or do it in the bushes! Don’t do it in the open, you’re making people uncomfortable! Know some shame!”</p>\n<p>Monkey at first didn’t get what the servant was talking about. Then he realized during infighting over the rendang, he had opened his legs, and Snake was on top of him in a very, very awkward manner.</p>\n<p>“Dammit!” he kicked Snake and trembling over the horror he caught himself in. But suddenly he noticed the rendang in his hand already vanished. He whirled his head around. Snake was already licking his fingers with a satisfied face.</p>\n<p>“Dammit!” Monkey howled again.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The one who enthusiastically greeted the young noble of Blackwood Family was Elder Jhamil instead of Bhela Malikh. He managed to conjure thirty years worth of bullshitting skills to flatter and fawn over the other party, rather thick faced to continue despite the young master of noble family rolled his eyes several times. As soon as the young noble caught the sight of a short-haired girl he immediately escaped from Elder Jhamil’s clutch with a big grin on his face.</p>\n<p>“Ah, Sister Bhela!”</p>\n<p>“Young Master Frane Blackwood.”</p>\n<p>“How are you doing Young Lady Bhela? Fancy to meet you again,” he said as he gifted the girl a flower.</p>\n<p>Bhela received the flower but then immediately passed it to a random maidservant beside her. She said as if it was nothing, “I’m fine. Thank you.”</p>\n<p>Young Master Frane Blackwood smiled wryly. “I’ve been travelling with hardly any rest so that I can see you sooner, my young lady,” the young master of Blackwood Family, Frane Blackwood, said, “may I be so lucky to receive your company tonight?”</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry, but here the words ‘tonight’s companion’ have different meanings than when you say it in the western-style ball--so, no, Young Master Blackwood, I can’t give you company tonight,” she said.</p>\n<p>The young noble still had a smile and wanted to correct his wording, but Bhela suddenly raised her hand and said, “Excuse me.”</p>\n<p>She went past him and greeted another pair of guests instead.</p>\n<p>“Greeting, sir, madam.”</p>\n<p>“It’s about time,” the middle-aged man didn’t answer Bhela’s greeting, but complained instead. “You know the other families had begun their ceremonies, right? Even though we don’t have the same ceremony as your Ngajen Ceremony from the place where I come from, but I know those who don’t take any old ceremonies seriously only brought bad luck over their lands.”</p>\n<p>There was a rare restraint in Bhela’s voice as she replied, “I apologize for our bad conduct, Sir Instructor. I will request the elders to proceed with the ceremony. Please let me lead you toward the reserved spot I previously prepared for both of you.”</p>\n<p>“Lead the way then.”</p>\n<p>Badril Village locals witnessed the valiant Young Lady of Malikh Family taking charge of the Ngajen Ceremony as the Chief Chef, but with the appearance of her bowing to two unfamiliar guests as well, whispers were floating amongst the Ngajen Ceremony guests. Before long, everyone knew that two guests Bhela Malikh greeted were the ones she personally invited, but was neglected before the family’s gate because of the excitement made by the noble’s arrival. Bhela came to them to apologize in person.</p>\n<p>Young Master Frane Blackwood, who felt ignored, pulled a self-decrepitating sneer. He complained to Elder Jhamil instead, “Oh, Malikh Family elder, can you tell me the identity of those two guests who made even Young Lady Bhela to bow her head?”</p>\n<p>“Ehem, ehem,” Elder Jhamil didn’t know what to answer, so he concocted a reply out of thin air, “I think they were relatives from her maternal family.”</p>\n<p>“Is that so? From the way they are dressed, they don’t look from that respectable background enough to get the young lady’s full attention. Don’t you think so?”</p>\n<p>“Young noble is right. Young Lady Bhela’s father once was a gangster thus he didn’t manage to teach common sense to the young lady. I’ll talk to her later to explain what’s really important.”</p>\n<p>After a bit of excuse and fawning, Young Master Blackwood felt this Elder Jhamil was acceptable. He told the Blackwood Family’s servants to bring the gifts he had prepared, which were naturally accepted by Elder Jhamil on the young lady’s behalf. In the meantime, people were disappointed that the drama they were expecting didn’t happen. But what could they do besides shaking their heads and disperse?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Year after year, the ngajen ceremony evolved from stiff sessions of praying ceremony for village safety to the new stylish festivities of foods and happy times for the youngsters, where fads and trends emerge. However big their way of life was changing the conservative major families, Yashura and Elzhier, still pretty much followed the old ways, especially when it came to the prayers. Only Malikh Family amongst the three that eager to embrace the new world that was coming. And by Elder Jhamil’s direction, instead of local shamans, Malikh Family asked help from foreign priests from western orthodox temples from nearby villages to lead the prayer.</p>\n<p>It was all good if one made a progressive decision with the greater good in mind. But here was the problem; orthodox temple priests usually led prayers for abundant harvest, while Ngajen Ceremony was all about calming Selaqs from descending the mountain. These priests probably hadn’t any clue how Selaqs looked like.</p>\n<p>“It was inappropriate for a noble to pray to old Mossack deities they don’t believe in, that was Malikhs’ excuses,'' Mila complained non-stop since they finished praying with other guests. In her hands--like a young mother hugging her baby--were plates of food she had just plundered from Malikh Family’s banquet tables prepared to entertain guests.</p>\n<p>“What deity? Wasn’t the mantra replaced from ancient Mossack prayers to magic spell mantra to calm down Selaq since… I don’t know, fifty years ago?” Romana said. The food in her hands was no less than Mila’s. These two girls seemed to think Malikh Family would regret offending them if they plunder the latter’s prepared feast like no tomorrow.</p>\n<p>“That's what I was saying! We no longer those ancient Mossacks who would sacrifice relatives so Selaqs won’t come down the mountain! Nowadays we’ve been using legit spells to keep all those Selaqs away, and these stupid Malikhs want to change the tradition just to appease some visiting noble? They’d rather avoid their noble guest to be uncomfortable than preventing Selaqs from coming down to chew their stupid brains, hah!”</p>\n<p>Compared to noisy girls beside him, Shira was able to keep his head to his feet. Romana signaled Mila with her eyes when she realized the boy wasn’t so into retaliating against the Malikhs; instead of invading the feast Shira, grabbed Malikh Family’s snacks moderately whenever he could--just like any other normal guests that came here.</p>\n<p>Mila grumbled with a bad mood, faced Shira and said, “Don’t you have something you need to do?”</p>\n<p>“Like what?” Shira hoped this cheeky cousin of his wouldn’t say something about kicking people’s asses again.</p>\n<p>“We can’t wait for something to happen,” she said. “Go ask that bitc--I mean, that fiancée of yours--go ask for a dance. The young’uns are starting to get heated. Look there, one of them couples are dancing. You go join them since that short-haired cunt is your fiancée after all.”</p>\n<p>Mila glanced around for a while before she realized she just had her tongue slipped. She quickly corrected her previous words, “Did I say cunt? I mean short-haired bitch--no, short-haired <em>young lady</em>.”</p>\n<p>“Why don’t you just be honest with yourself here. People have been calling Malikhs much worse here because the foreign priests matter!” Romana laughed.</p>\n<p>At that moment a very young maidservant of Malikh Family just passed by and overheard their conversation. The little maidservant snorted in anger, which made Mila snorted back as a retort.</p>\n<p>“Go, go! Go dance with her!” Mila whispered when she was sure only Shira and Romana were around.</p>\n<p>Shira clicked his tongue. “I don’t even have a single proper conversation with her these past ten years. Why should I go ask her dance out of the blue? Just showing our face around here is enough.”</p>\n<p>“Fool! If she accepted to dance with you then all is good, that would only confirm Malikh Family’s cocky attitude is only because their dipshit brains are getting fried by their own inflated proud ego, nothing serious! But if she ignores you in front of others… heh--she dares!”</p>\n<p>“That’s easy for you to say. If someone you don’t like suddenly asks your hands for a dance, what would you feel later on when you found out refusing means two families become enemies?”</p>\n<p>“Uh-uh, I don’t feel nothing. If he’s my fiancé then it’s my job to go my way out to make it clear in public! Going dancing, going kissing, like a proper damned couple! That’s what the goddamn engagement is all about! Right?”</p>\n<p>Mila ate a cookie and she blinked. Unsure of the previous words she said, she glanced at Romana and murmured, “...right?”</p>\n<p>Romana shrugged.</p>\n<p>But Shira wouldn’t back down easily. He continued arguing, “What if your fiancé is Bony Elzhier, then? Are you going to kiss him to prove he’s your fiancé?”</p>\n<p>Mila hid her gasp.</p>\n<p>“You wanna die?” she pursed her lips. “Listen to me or I’m gonna smack your face!”</p>\n<p>Shira groaned against his cousin’s unreasonableness. But before he could concoct a satisfying retort, Snake and Monkey came out of nowhere.</p>\n<p>“Oh, Young Master Shira,” Monkey came patting him on the shoulder, “it seems you get cuckolded for real this time.”</p>\n<p>People were clapping and whistling as the flashy Young Master Frane Blackwood led Young Lady Bhela Malikh by the hand.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Malikh was entertaining two guests previously, but that bald elder raised a fuss about how she neglected the young noble, so in the end it came to this.”</p>\n<p>Monkey laughed as he teased Shira with his elbow, “They’re going to dance. When two people were dancing in Ngajen Ceremony, that meant they--” he caught the scary experssion on Mila’s face, stopped, “nevermind…”</p>\n<p>“That slut!” Mila hissed.</p>\n<p>This was getting serious. Whenever Mila showed that kind of face something bad would happen. Again, the moment Shira opened his mouth to say something, someone else came to grab him in the shoulder.</p>\n<p>“Brat, your woman is going to cuckold you in public,” said the newcomer, Good-Natured Spirit, who literally came out of the thin air.</p>\n<p>“You too?”</p>\n<p>Shira had a headache. Both Monkey and Snake couldn’t see the annoying Good-Natured Spirit, but the three of them were in harmony in mocking him. They mocked him to the point saying he wouldn’t care would only embarrass him further.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, being led by the hand, Bhela Malikh asked Young Master Blackwood, “What kind of remedy Blackwood Family brought with you?”</p>\n<p>“Why so much in hurry, my young lady?” the young noble gave a laugh and a flash of smile. “No need to worry, Blackwood Family sympathize with the disaster that befell your father, so my mother send me here to personally deliver the medicine Blackwood House had sought far and wide.”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh said nothing more. The Young Master of Blackwood Family pondered as he read the cold expression of the girl, thinking that even with flowers and jewelry gifts, nothing could move this young lady. Such a waste of that beautiful face to not letting a single smile escaped, Young Master Blackwood could only smacked his lips and shook his head. But as soon as he mentioned a medicine he brought for her father, the feisty young lady became amiable almost immediately.</p>\n<p>Good thing for him. Bhela Malikh was talented, the Blackwood Family planned to have her inside their house, and if things went this smoothly he could do that his mother told him sooner than he expected.</p>\n<p>“Little bitch of Malikh Family,” a girl roared, “you finally show your true color you bitch! Is Yashura Family a joke to you?!”</p>\n<p>The furious Mila Yashura became the center of attention. She snorted as she strode, like an angry bull preparing to charge, with the mood that would make the crowd wordlessly give way to her. Not only because they didn’t want anything to do with the infamous young lady of Yashura Family--who, when angry, once punched Bony in the face with a nosebleed--but also because she got a sword in her hands.</p>\n<p>Shira glanced down. His father’s sword he brought with him was gone. He looked again at the unsheated weapon in his cousin’s hands.</p>\n<p>He could only slap his own face the moment he noticed what was happened.</p>\n<p>Mila took a step forward slowly, but her face turned even fiercer. She spoke, “You got guts to bring a lover from outside, eh? I knew something fishy happened when I saw you cut your hair, you little slut.”</p>\n<p>“I cut my hair because it got in the way during my training,” Bhela replied plainly. “And this is not my lover. Just a relative of my friend.”</p>\n<p>“You lying little slut. As if someone like you have any friends!”</p>\n<p>“I do have a friend.” Bhela said. A rare emphasizing tone in her voice was telling that she was upset, but she held back from explaining further.</p>\n<p>“I don’t care what your excuse is! Do you think I don’t know what you shitty Malikhs up to? You already don’t put Yashura Family in your eyes, eh? Just because you bitch have a little vacation outside, eh? If you think you’re a big shot, why don’t you prove it here and now?!”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh was silent for a while. Looking at Mila, she then asked, “And what are you suggesting I should do, Young Lady Yashura?”</p>\n<p>Mila stabbed her sword into the ground.</p>\n<p>“I just want to know how awesome is this Archer class you’ve got overseas that makes you Malikhs stop putting us Yashuras in your eyes,” Mila sneered. “Why don’t we test it with my sword, eh? Let’s do a duel, bitch.”</p>\n<p>Bhela just looked at Mila strangely.</p>\n<p>“But you’re a Specialist class,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Aha! Getting scared, aren’t ya, you little cunt?”</p>\n<p>Bhela didn’t want to argue with her. So she told the nearest servant to go grab a bow.</p>\n<p>On the other side, Monkey anxiously elbowed Shira, said, “Should I drag your cousin back?”</p>\n<p>“Stand down, mister. Mila is the one who’s starting it. She can’t afford to back down now.”</p>\n<p>Beside them Snake was nodding as he understood what Shira meant.</p>\n<p>Then with a laugh, Good-Natured Spirit, who was already tired jeering him, said to Shira. “Kid, shit just got real. Ain’t that a good idea to pull her before it’s too late?”</p>\n<p>Shira wanted to but he couldn’t. He knew exactly Mila’s strength. Fighting bare hands, she might get a chance to stand against the strongest youngster in the village, but it would become a different story when weapons and mana were involved.</p>\n<p>Since Mila was the one to propose the duel, bailing out before the fight began would be slapping her own face in front of the guests. It was a bad idea, because Mila didn’t appear to have the slightest chance to win. So bad that it’d be more reasonable to just surrender. But Shira knew Mila hated to go back on her words the most. Thus he silently moved closer to her, prepared to pull her back in before the situation really got out of his hands.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Young Master Blackwood, was pulled out by an adjutant of his family.</p>\n<p>Smirking, he asked the adjutant, “Who is that girl who picking a fight with Bhela?”</p>\n<p>“Seems like the eldest young lady of that family,” the adjutant replied.</p>\n<p>“You mean the family my Bhela got engaged to?” Young Master Frane Blackwood asked as if Bhela already his. The corner of his lips curled as he thought this might be a good chance to do something on the engagement that Blackwood House already saw as a thorn in their eyes. “Do you have something on that girl?”</p>\n<p>“Replying to young master, since Yashura Family is the main obstacle for us to get Young Lady Bhela Malikh to our side, your mother has already sent someone to investigate them. The eldest young lady of Yashura Family merely a Level 10 Specialist class who just graduated from Novice about seven months ago.”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood couldn’t help but chuckle. Even though the two young ladies had the same level, a Specialist merely support class that wasn’t suited in combat. This duel affair would turn out to be a joke.</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood scoffed. “Let my Bhela teach her some manners. I don’t want anyone to disturb us after this.”</p>\n<p>“Young master,” the adjutant lowered his voice, “I don’t think that’s a good idea.”</p>\n<p>“What’s on your mind, adjutant?”</p>\n<p>“I just made a round to check the guests attending this ceremony, and I found…”--he lowered his voice--“...some spectators amongst the guests that shouldn’t have be here….”</p>\n<p>“Go on,” the young noble urged.</p>\n<p>“I just received the word, young master, there are experts that Elder Jhamil said he didn’t invite.”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood frowned. “What… what’s that supposed to mean?”</p>\n<p>On the less crowded place of the courtyard, the middle-aged man who Bhela greeted before, along with the middle-aged woman, watched the commotion unfold while nibbling on steamed peanuts. He glanced at the other place where a man calmly sipping tea, a man with a hard face who couldn’t hide his sharp aura, then swept his gaze at the one who beside him, a short stature man who wore a headband to hide his reddish hair from public, who also happened to enjoy steamed peanuts while his focus solely at one direction in the crowd.</p>\n<p>All of them came in common garments incognito. But still Elder Jhamil sent people to keep tabs on them, especially since the bald elder still didn’t know the reason Bhela Malikh invited these foreigners.</p>\n<p>The ngajen ceremony usually consisted of three main parts--prayer, socializing, and sending offerings to the mountain as the finale. It was uncommon for irrelevant events to happen between them. However, since the young lady of the host had already accepted the duel, Malikh Family set up an emergency venue for the fight.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil came to invite himself as the judge. For a change to hummiliate those simple Yashuras and to slip himself onto the spotlight, he couldn’t ask for better opportunity.</p>\n<p>“You two ready?” Elder Jhamil asked both of the opposing sides. “This is a friendly match between two friendly families. So stop before your blade hit your enemy,” he said, seemingly talking to either sides, but didn’t say anything about the arrows part.</p>\n<p>Since Bhela Malikh was an Archer, she suggested to Mila, “I’m using a bow. So you can move first. I’ll try to dodge for ten seconds.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t need that,” Mila scoffed.</p>\n<p>“Very well…” she said. She glanced at Elder Jhamil, said, “Elder Jhamil, please begin the duel.&quot;</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil counted to three.</p>\n<p>The duel began.</p>\n<p>“AAAAAA!!!” Mila roared with the sword raised above her head, charging ahead.</p>\n<p>Contrast to her opponent’s battle cry, Bhela was solemn. She picked four arrows from the quiver tied on her hips. Nocking the arrows simultaneously, she took a deep breath as she concentrated to channel different natures elemental mana from her manasphere. The mana, through fingers and her thumb, flowing into all the four arrows and soon the tip of the arrows glowed with four different colors.</p>\n<p>The wind began to stir.</p>\n<p>And she raised the bow. She released the arrows.</p>\n<p><em>Fuuush fuuuushhh fuuushh shhuuuuusshh!</em></p>\n<p>Before even everyone noticed what happened, the mana Bhela channeled melted the flying arrows, within a span of milliseconds, turning them into dangerous magic projectiles of four elemental natures--fire, water, wind and lightning.</p>\n<p>Mila was confident before. She knew a trick against an Archer, but here she was dumbfounded by magic arrows coming to blast her way. She thought she was fighting an Archer, but got up against a Mage instead. This wasn’t what she signed up for.</p>\n<p><em>Clank!</em></p>\n<p>The first blue arrow dissapeared almost the moment it reached Mila. The sound of metallic clash that followed the said arrow resounded three more times, and the three arrows left behind too disappeared almost immediately. Mila, thought she ought to dodge the magic arrows, leap a step backward, but her hasty movement combined with the slippery mud made her slipped her foothold, accidentally fell to her butt instead.</p>\n<p>Bhela aimed down her bow. Everyone was staring at her with complicated and questioning gaze, as an Archer who could do magic, this was the first time everyone witnessed it.</p>\n<p>“It’s a four elemental affinity spell!” someone’s voice roared through the silenced venue, “I heard it, I doubted it, but she really did it!”</p>\n<p>Everyone looked at his way, the man who shouted, and saw that it was the middle-aged man whom Bhela invited from outside the village. He sat eating steamed peanuts then, now he was standing perplexed.</p>\n<p>Bhela, realizing that the man was the center of the attention, and bow to him from afar.</p>\n<p>“She really did it…” the man said under his breath.</p>\n<p>Someone who sat beside him said, “Sure she did, the only one right now--I guess now that you big brain from Elemental Stone School witnessed it I guess you can die without regret?”</p>\n<p>The man looked at the woman who accompanied him, he said still with expression of disbelieve, “It’s a four elemental affinity spell…”</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, you already said that.”</p>\n<p>The last and the most famous multi elemental Unique Class was, a mage with three elemental affinity skills, died of old age--was actually the headmaster of Elemental Stone School from seventy years ago. As a scholar and a mage researching deeply in topics of elemental mana all of his career, how could he didn’t know the value of a Unique Class who surpassed even the ex-headmaster of his school?</p>\n<p>“I can’t believe someone without a Mage Unique Class really did it…”</p>\n<p>“The most promising talent of this generation, alright, the first time I witnessed an Archer could do magic,” the woman said. “Good thing she stopped her arrows then--if not, the other girl would ended up so pitiful.”</p>\n<p>As the woman said that, someone else blurted not far away from there.</p>\n<p>“She didn’t stop it.”</p>\n<p>“Pardon? Sir Kurusiya?” the woman asked.</p>\n<p>The one she was talking to was the quiet man with sharp aura. He said as a matter of fact like tone, “She didn’t stop it. Someone else did,” he sipped his tea, and when the woman still confused, he explained with hoarse voice, “those are magic, but they were still arrows shot from a bow. You can’t stop flying arrows. That girl calculated and slightly missed her aim as to not hurting her opponent. But she didn’t plan to stop it.”</p>\n<p>The woman questioned him, “If she wasn’t the one who stopped it, then would you know why the arrows disappears?”</p>\n<p>The man put down his glass of tea. “I don’t know. Why you ask me? Ask that fool there who’s been grinning all the time.”</p>\n<p>The woman, along with the middle-aged man from Stone Elemental School, looked up to the bearded foreigner.</p>\n<p>“She’s not the one who stopped it,” the bearded man said with a smile.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Mila, who mellowed from her defeat and still sat on the muddy ground, gulped as she saw her cousin come to pick her up.</p>\n<p>“I lost,” she said to Shira.</p>\n<p>“No you didn’t, that girl is the one who put down her bow first, and you still got your swords in your hands--so technically you’d win.”</p>\n<p>“I fell to my butt, I was humiliated,” Mila said, her voice trembled, “I lost….”</p>\n<p>Shira sighed. He grabbed Mila’s hand and pulled her up. “It’s adult problems from hereon, Uncle Shuro would likely summon my father back. For now, let’s get out of here,” he said.</p>\n<p>Monkey and Snake, along with the nervous Romana, came to follow them from behind to shield them from people’s laughter. Mila was so humiliated the usually feisty tomboy was so down she couldn’t afford to hold her head straight. As Shira witnessed how pitiful his cousin was, regret overwhelming him when he remembered how he was holding back from taking action himself.</p>\n<p>“Brat,” someone called him.</p>\n<p>Shira turned his head. It was Good-Natured Spirit.</p>\n<p>“You owe me this time,” the Nalaq said.</p>\n<p>Shira nodded.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>“Hear ye hear ye people! Gather around and hear me announce something incredible, people! Gather around, will ya!”</p>\n<p>Standing on top of a table, Elder Jhamil shouted to gather people, announcing something that the Young Master of Blackwood Family passed him beforehands. “Although winner of the duel is Young Lady Bhela, Young Master Frane of Blackwood House is concerned by some stupid unruly girl of the supposed biggest family in Badril Village behavior would smear my young lady--”</p>\n<p>“Big news! Big news!” someone else’s shouting cut off Elder Jhamil’s announcement, “Young Master Bonithon is running around beating people! Watch your mouth if you don’t want get beaten for no reason!”</p>\n<p>“Bony is going crazy! He’s going to kick people’s asses! Nobody knows why!”</p>\n<p>“What the fuck is going on! Why Elzhier Family messing with us Malikhs now?”</p>\n<p>At the chaotic scene before him, Elder Jhamil’s face showed a frown and a hint of hesitation. He then cleared his phlegm anyway, trying to get people’s attention, then pushed on announcing carefully, “Young Master Frane Blackwood is concerned that--”</p>\n<p>“Elder Jhamil!!” a servant came running with a horrified expression, “Bony is coming for you, run away!”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil pointed his finger at the servant and roared, “What is that brat from Elzhier Family wants to do with me! Go kick him out, I’m trying to tell everybody something important here!”</p>\n<p>“But he doesn’t listen to reasons! He’s going to punch your face, is what he said just now!”</p>\n<p>“Imbecile! Do you think a young master would jump around like a monkey and punch an elder of another family in the damn face?! He’s making ruckus. Go on, kick him out!”</p>\n<p>Looking at the crowd from the rushedly made stage, he then smiled and continued, “Right, everybody, it’s Young Master of Blackwood Family; what I’m saying is that since Young Lady Bhela Malikh is winning with ease against the foolish young lady of <em>that</em> family, Young Master Blackwood concerned that some people would shrug my young lady’s victory. So he proposed, in order to make it clear the disparity between Malikh and--sheesh--Yashura, he proposed that him as a friendly representative of Malikh Family and Shira Yashura as the repre--”</p>\n<p>“Elder Jhamil--watch out!”</p>\n<p>He had it taking from lowly servants who cut off his announcement. Fuming in anger, Elder Jhamil pointed his finger toward the one who was spriting toward him and roared, “How many times I told you to just kick him out! Shut your trap and go kick the damned brat!”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was losing his cool. But what he failed to realize in time was that the one who sprinted toward him wasn’t a servant from his family. It was not the one who telling him to run away. And before he knew it, someone leaped up on the table where he was standing and delivered a punch to the face.</p>\n<p>“Gaaahhh!”</p>\n<p>Even after Elder Jhamil stumbled down the table he stood on, his assaulter didn’t plan to let him go. And what came after that was a torrent of hardened fist, pummeling his face even though he screamed for mercy. Only when the chaotic crowd succeeded in saving him did Elder Jhamil see the assaulter’s face--it was indeed the Young Master from Elzhier Family.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Bonithon… what did you… why did you do this… for what reason?!” Elder Jhamil choked out his grievance.</p>\n<p>Bony, the man who beat the bald elder black and blue, replied with nothing but a cold stare. Instead, it was an almost incoherent voice of Pilek who answered instead.</p>\n<p>“Kekekek, don’t be angry Elder Baldy! We just discussed how you were a splendid Pugilist a long time ago, so Boss Bony came here to find out whether it was true or not! That’s why he asked you to a barehand duel!” Pilek came in with a swagger and a bottle of booze in his hand. From a single glance anybody could tell he was drunk.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s lips trembled. What duel? That brat just leaped out of nowhere without saying anything, then immediately beating him black and blue!</p>\n<p>The only one from the three delinquents who hadn’t had the smell of liquor from his body was Polio. He wore an apologetic smile, and with a slight sigh, he said, “Please forgive them, dear kind Malikh sirs, my friends are terrible when they are drunk.”</p>\n<p>Polio made a round to apologize to any Malikhs he saw. But the Malikh Family didn’t appreciate his gesture, receiving jeerings in return.</p>\n<p>Polio was a patient young man, but Pilek wasn’t. The drunk Pilek didn’t take their attitude kindly, randomly walking to a servant, said, “Hah? What the fuck are you staring me at, you no-name Malikh servant? Wanna die, eh? Huuuraah!!!”</p>\n<p><em>Shatter!</em></p>\n<p>Without a warning he swung the booze in his hand to a Malikh family servant. The man he attacked stumbled backward holding his bloodied head from the crash Pilek gave him.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Bhela Malikh had just settled greeting four foreign guests that she invited from outside, and was on her way to fetch cuisines from the kitchen to humor her guests, then she witnessed the chaotic brawl unfold with a crowdful of cheers and jeers mixed in between. Perhaps there were more than a dozen men involved, with the Malikhs servants, guards, common family members even an elder came along to surround Bony and his two underlings.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela…” a little maidservant with a crest of Elzhier Family in her uniform bowed to Bhela politely.</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at her. She returned the bow even though the other party clearly was a servant. “Miss Elzhier,” she spoke softly.</p>\n<p>“No need to be polite to this servant, Young Lady.”</p>\n<p>“I can’t be impolite to Sister Ryntia’s friends.”</p>\n<p>The Elzhier Family maidservant smiled. Since Bhela insisted, then she wouldn’t be bowing her head anymore.</p>\n<p>She said, “Eldest Young Lady sends me to ask for your forgiveness for her brother’s brashness, Young Lady Bhela.”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at the brawl that started in her family’s courtyard. This chaos would spell imperfect on tonight's Malikh Family’s Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>“There’s no need for that. Since I accepted Young Lady Mila Yashura’s duel then I somewhat anticipated Young Master Bonithon will follow suit to make trouble tonight. If anything, it is I the one who should apologize to Sister Ryntia because I couldn’t handle the situation well. Please tell her that I’ll try to maintain friendship between Malikh and Elzhier Family.”</p>\n<p>Still with the serene smile on her face, the Elzhier Family maidservant studied the expression on Bhela’s face. She spoke a moment after, “Then I’ll let Eldest Young Lady Elzhier knows by tomorrow.”</p>\n<p>“Thanks,” Bhela offered her gratitude with a bow.</p>\n<p>By this time, the brawl became anything but intensified, as men either from Elzhier Family or thugs that previously had dealings with Bony’s group came in to reinforce the Elzhier young master. Before the Malikhs could pressure the intruders with numbers, but then the completely overwhelmed by the new reinforcement.</p>\n<p>“Huurraaahh!” Pilek sent a Malikh man flying with his kick. “Where the fuck your previous cocky taunt? Cat got your tongue, eh?”</p>\n<p>The only unspoken rules in brawls were strictly no usage of mana and spell as well as no sharp objects to use as weapons. But when it was chaotic and nobody could watch everybody the sharpest mind with tricks the one who prevailed--this is why the likes of Pilek and his friend Polio who always struck in place people wouldn’t be willing the one who were taking the advantage in brawls. Even hunters and seasoned guards were no match against these naughty brats.</p>\n<p>For example, when Pilek’s punch was blocked by Elder Jhamil’s son, “You shitty brat, just wait till I deal with your father--kuukgghh!”</p>\n<p>And because no one was watching, Pilek used his knee to strike the cocky young elder in the balls.</p>\n<p>With a sad whimper from his trembling lips, Elder Jhamil’s son curled onto the ground holding his precious balls that Polio struck.</p>\n<p>Seeing that a family elder was mercilessly defeated, a few Malikhs came to avenge their young elder. By then, Pilek already had Polio watching over his back.</p>\n<p>At that point, no Malikhs could match them in hand-in-hand brawl.</p>\n<p>A stranger then casually walked in. Pilek stopped, looking at him, and amidst the chaotic scene it took a while for him to find out that the man was actually a foreigner--an eastern Kaya man. The man had a sheathed sword on his hips. But Pilek wasn’t afraid as long as he stick with the brawl rules to use only fighting unarmed.</p>\n<p>“Huurraaah!”</p>\n<p>Pilek threw a feint. Most simple Malikhs would fall for this. But the eastern Kaya man didn’t budge. Seemed to even anticipate it. With a movement too fast for Pilek to follow the man grabbed his wrist, flicked him and sent him into the air like it was nothing.</p>\n<p>It was only after Pilek rolled in the mud he realized what had happened.</p>\n<p>The man then glanced aside and walked toward Polio who in his own right was too engrossed with the brawl. With his left hand pushing Polio’s shoulder and the other hand grabbing his wrist, he flipped Polio just like he did Pilek beforehand.</p>\n<p>Pilek and a few others that the man previously flipped were amazed by how effortlessly the man disabling enthusiastic young men from fighting.</p>\n<p>The sword handle the man had was wrapped with cloth and its body too thin for regular blades. Those who noticed this would understand that the man wasn’t an ordinary Kaya. Polio was one of them.</p>\n<p>“A Samurai!” he exclaimed a moment after he got thrown onto the muddy ground.</p>\n<p>The Kaya man stopped, looking at him, then spoke with a displeased tone, “I am but a masterless ronin.”</p>\n<p>The man then continued walking toward a different direction.</p>\n<p>Bony was fighting with three men alone, so he couldn’t afford to look around. He didn’t realize the Kaya man at first, but when the man tried to grab the wild young master’s wrist, Bony reacted--he reacted by throwing a punch to the man’s face.</p>\n<p>The man slapped his flying fist from the side, tremendously muffled its momentum. Again, he tried to grab Bony’s wrist and his shoulder. Bony tried resisting but the man’s speed was too fast for him to compete.</p>\n<p>As the man prepared to flip him, Bony felt a faint gush of the wind from his legs. It didn’t take him a second to realize the man just putting his hand on his shoulder as a feint--his real target was to gently nudge his foot on rooting from the ground, which, if he’d focus his effort to get his shoulder free from the man’s grasp, a small window of opening that could be used by his opponent to disrupt his sense of balance. Thus Bony firmly stomped his feet to the ground instead. He grabbed the man’s sleeve to make his opponent not be able to easily throw like Pilek and Polio.</p>\n<p>Responding to Bony’s choice, the man curled the corner of his lips. Bony caught a hint of taunt when he staring the man in the eyes.</p>\n<p>“Kkuuuggghh!”</p>\n<p>Bony did succeed in preventing himself get flipped to the ground. But he got struck in the gut instead.</p>\n<p>The man didn’t let him go. The moment Bony stepping backward due to shock having stricken, the man was charging and got his wrist in the blink of the eyes--what happened afterward was Bony got his feet swept and he completely lost his ground, and got cheered by his friends as the last man who got thrown into the mud.</p>\n<p>Bony then sat there looking as the fight stopped; since someone took him down, more and less the Malikhs had won the brawl.</p>\n<p>“Aren’t you Thoqek’s son?” the Kaya man asked Bony.</p>\n<p>Bony wasn’t willing to open his mouth when his father’s name got mentioned.</p>\n<p>Receiving no answer, the man thus carelessly said, “Unexpectedly, you’ve got more guts than your father. Get up now, and stop making trouble in Ghalim Malikh’s home.”</p>\n<p>The young ruffians with Bony as the leader naturally wouldn’t be arrogant anymore since they had been defeated. They retreated calmly, and the Malikhs didn’t dare taunt them the second time in case Bony would change his mind and started on a rampage again. In the end, the real reason why Bony came targeting Malikh Family, as many people knew, was that he wasn’t a drinker that would lose reason to punch another family’s elder in the face.</p>\n<p>Speaking about an elder who got a punch in the face; after Bony and others were gone, Elder Jhamil showed his nose out of his hiding place. He gritted his teeth. He swore he’d use his full resource to get back from Bony’s father in the next village council meeting.</p>\n<p>“Elder Jhamil, you still haven’t announced the thing I ask you to do,” from behind, the sullen young noble Frane Blackwood said to him.</p>\n<p>“Y-young Master Blackwood, please spare me--the mood isn’t that good to draw people’s attention after that kid crashing our Ngajen Ceremony just now. How about I brief it to other village leaders tomorrow in the village council meeting?”</p>\n<p>“No, I want everyone to know it by tonight. This is the right time and the right place to announce it. Besides, I want to see what kind of a young man the one who’s supposed to be my rival.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil didn’t want to show his beaten face to the crowd tonight. But as much as he love his face he knew flattery wouldn’t get him out of this situation--at least not if he didn’t want to offend the young noble. And so with a heavy face he climbed the table once again, hiding off his reluctancy.</p>\n<p>Someone heartily made a joke on him, “Elder Jhamil, we thought you’re a man who care about face the most--I don’t expect you to boldly show how handsome you’ve become now!”</p>\n<p>“Kids nowadays getting big headed by their privileges as young masters--naturally I’ll let their fathers know how to discipline their brats!” Elder Jhamil coldly said. “Anyway, you all know that my Young Lady Bhela is a girl with talent and her future is boundless. Here in Malikh Family we’re not willing to throw our princess to cow’s dunk that is Yashura Family’s trash young master. And our friend Young Noble Frane Blackwood also thinks the same!”</p>\n<p>Such passionate speech, naturally people were cheering in anticipation of the next spectacle they thought they were going to witness.</p>\n<p>Getting the cue from Elder Jhamil, Frane Blackwood came forward with a swagger. “I speak this as a close friend of Young Lady Bhela Malikh. Someone with the name of Shira Yashura; if you think you’re worthy of her, do you dare to prove it by having a duel with me?!”</p>\n<p>The crowd was silent. They were waiting for the reply.</p>\n<p>Frane Blackwood swept the crowd with his eyes.</p>\n<p>Someone said to him the boy he challenged was utter trash. He was amused guessing how this trash would respond to his duel challenge, especially when Bhela Malikh had just completely defeated the cheeky young lady from his family.</p>\n<p>There were already murmurs spreading. People were also curious whether Shira was going to accept or run away from it.</p>\n<p>And then…</p>\n<p>“<em>Cough, cough…</em>” someone awkwardly stepped forward with a wry smile plastered on his face. People recognized his face, which looked like a monkey, and many of them had seen him together with Shira Yashura.</p>\n<p>He was Monkey. He said, “This young noble… about your proposed duel… I’m afraid Young Master Shira Yashura can’t answer it tonight.”</p>\n<p>Frane Blackwood laughed. “Why? He’s scared? His cousin challenged Young Lady Bhela to a duel for no apparent reason; don’t tell me we can do the same to them?”</p>\n<p>“No, it’s not that.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil pointed his finger at Monkey. “We all know Shira Yashura is a trash who can’t even advance to Level 4 Novice! Young Master Frane Blackwood is kind. Tonight, he’s going to give Shira one chance to admit that he’s unworthy of Young Lady Bhela Malikh to the crowd here. He does that, and there will be no need for Young Master Frane Blackwood to embarrass him by kicking his ass!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, but he can’t give you an answer tonight,” Monkey insisted.</p>\n<p>Now it was Elder Jhamil who laughed. “He’s really scared facing Young Master Frane right now?!”</p>\n<p>“No…”</p>\n<p>“Then why?”</p>\n<p>Monkey sighed.</p>\n<p>“Because he’s already gone home!”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was furious. The whole point he had to gather people even though his face had been beaten by Bony was to call out the boy and embarrass him in public, as per the young noble request. But the said person himself already went home, so Elder Jhamil standing on top of the table was for nothing.</p>\n<p>Immediately he ordered a servant to send the message to Yashura Family, while in between, cursing the fact that he didn’t get the chance to distract the guests from discussing the previous brawl. Sure enough, not only the people were talking about Bhela Malikh’s hidden Unique Class, they were also talking about Bony, and people he beat to pulp, especially Elder Jhamil. People no longer cared to gossip about Young Lady Mila Yashura who had been sent home defeated, but they laughed at someone present who had just his misfortune like Elder Jhamil instead.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil had lost his face in the end. Literally and metaphorically.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, with a solemn expression Monkey looked at his partner Snake who was enjoying the banquet and had amused himself watching the spectacle previously.</p>\n<p>Monkey said with a whisper, “Why the hell your family doesn’t show his face when they dumping shit to Young Master and Young Lady Yashura just now?!”</p>\n<p>Snake glanced at him lazily. “I don’t know. They said they were going to diagnose Patriarch Ghalim Malikh previously.”</p>\n<p>“Can’t you just fetch your brother instead? Didn’t you put your words to assure young master before this? What if he thinks we’re people who put our words lightly?”</p>\n<p>“The one who’s diagnosing the patriarch is my grandfather, my brother supposed to be free enough to be a busybody just now,” Snake said, displeased by Monkey’s tone accusing him of being unloyal to his own word.</p>\n<p>Actually, he also confused why his brother didn’t show his nose when Young Lady Mila recklessly brought a sword to challenge Bhela to a duel. From his understanding of his brother’s character and the relationship between his family and Yashura from what he knew told him that more or less his brother was going to back Yashura if the drama with Malikh Family intensified. But he didn’t. Snake would barge into Malikh Family’s doors to look for his grandfather if he knew it was going to be like this instead.</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-3/chapter-5-1":"<authors-note id=\"Radhy\" type=\"danger\">\n<p>I don’t recommend reading from here onwards because the chapter below is still from the previous draft, which is different from the previous 4 chapters. Further edits will be made that most likely makes this chapter quite different than the current one.</p>\n</authors-note>\n<p>In a certain hall in Malikh Family’s left wing complex, four people sat idly on the bamboo mats covered floor. They were being served local-specialty ginger drinks mixed with brown sugar with herbs to drink. There were also some roasted peanuts to chew. Despite they dressed humbly when attending the Ngajen Ceremony, three of them were elders with statuses, while one of them, the sword bearing Kaya man, wasn’t anyone to ignore either.</p>\n<p>Having knowing this, they still waiting for their host, Bhela Malikh, to wrap up the Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>“Still,” Madame Sylvia said after a sip of ginger drink, “I wouldn’t have expected the girl’s talent to be that rare when she approached my sect with the invitation. The top brass only interested of her being the top grade during the seminar thus sent me to check her out. How about you, Mister Harrington?”</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t expecting it either. I only interested when the report said she showed a potential of being two elemental-affinities Archer. Three already great, but with four elementals, chances she’ll get her name down in history books.”</p>\n<p>“That is what happen if she able to live long enough to develop her full potential,” the quiet man with sharp aura remarked. His face was thin, rough, and since he never liked to smile, he always looked like he meant business. The man was role model of eastern Kaya race ancient warriors--stand and sit in straight posture, humorless, and most importantly, always bringing the sharp, thin sword of katana on his hips.</p>\n<p>Madame Sylvia was interested on his remark. So she asked, “Oh, why you think of that, Sir Kurusiya?”</p>\n<p>The eastern man replied, “Because she tangled herself with Blackwood Family,” he paused. “If this Blackwood the same one from this Blackwood guy I know, then it’s definitely a bad news for her.”</p>\n<p>Mister Harrington from Elemental Stone School disagreed.</p>\n<p>“Since when our factions become soft?” he questioned. “We’re not that pitiful to handle some second-rate noble family. Honestly, I think that young man from that Blackwood Family such a pest. If Young Lady Bhela asks for my favor, I’ll handle him cleanly and thoroughly--right here, right now.”</p>\n<p>“I’m not talking about Blackwood Family, I’m talking about the creepy guy with Blackwood as his last name,” Sir Kurusiya said as he put down his ginger drink. He wasn’t happy, so Madame Sylvia signaled Mister Harrington that it best not to continue arguing with the scary eastern Kaya man.</p>\n<p>The hall suddenly turned quiet. Then, the fourth man was happily enjoyed his drink, out of the blue he blurted for his opinion that no one asked for. “That boy from Yashura Family is sure interesting…”</p>\n<p>Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia smiled wryly. Nobody said anything about Yashura Family up until now. The fourth man, Baront Staterwind, came from a very peculiar faction. Which actually had nothing to do with Bhela’s type of talent. Even when he had already came to Badril Village, none would think he accepted Bhela Malikh’s invitation just to scout her talent.</p>\n<p>The hall’s door was knocked. Bhela entered. She politely greeted the four respected guests before she sat down.</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry for the wait, dear elders. Malikh Family hasn’t prepared the best dishes for you during the ceremony, so I asked the best chef we have to cook special meals for you,” Bhela said, then she glanced at the door. “Please enter, aunty!”</p>\n<p>The moment she called, a middle-aged woman who helped Bhela in the kitchen before came with a line of maidservants, bringing freshly cooked dinner meals with them. It was better than what the Malikhs served for the guests before, even compared to the meals served for the family’s important guests cooked by Bhela as the chief chef.</p>\n<p>“I rather you serve me some alcohol,” the eastern Sir Kurusiya said to her.</p>\n<p>Bhela nodded at his request and asked the aunty to fetch the best alcohol she could find. Of course, the best person to get help was the elder who provided Bhela with the hall to host her guests. Bhela hoped the said elder already knew the importance of this meeting thus not being stingy with his alcohol collection.</p>\n<p>“Can we start now, young lady? I don’t have a good alcohol tolerance so I rather get this completed before us adults get to drink,” Madame Sylvia said.</p>\n<p>“We have delicious food here served, Madame Sylvia. To be honest, all the wait before is for the aunties preparing dinner for dear elders,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>But not of the adults believed her words easily.</p>\n<p>“Hoho, you seem so nervous, young lady. You might not look like it, but you seem about to cry,” Sir Baront Staterwind said.</p>\n<p>“Just state what you want from us, don’t waste anymore time,” Sir Kurusiya urged.</p>\n<p>Bhela lowered her head. With her lips tremblingly parted, she said, “As you might know, my father fell ill when I was overseas attending the seminar. My mother has contacted many doctors and alchemists to make medicines for him, yet my father’s condition never improved. I request for elders’ wisdom and strength, please help my poor father, he was in misery for months…”</p>\n<p>Bhela prostated.</p>\n<p>“Please, help me father… he’s dying… please…” she begged.</p>\n<p>Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia exchanged glances. The peculiar beardy man, Sir Baront, merely nodded without letting his thoughts known. Meanwhile, Sir Kurusiya, who didn’t bulge seeing the pretty girl begging in front of him, coldly said, “Well, this is really a waste of time.”</p>\n<p>Hearing the eastern man snorted, Bhela’s heart went cold. She prepared herself bowing down for help, without stating a single offer to prove how desperate herself.</p>\n<p>“And, young lady…” Madame Sylvia asked slowly, “what would you do if someone managed to heal your father?”</p>\n<p>Bhela rose up. She looked straight to Madam Sylvia’s gaze, then said, “Anything,”</p>\n<p>“Anything?”</p>\n<p>“Anything.”</p>\n<p>The room went quiet. Only Mister Harrington’s regretful sigh could be heard.</p>\n<p>It was Sir Baront Staterwind who explained with a good intention, “It really seems you haven’t grasped the situation you were in, young lady. The guest who gave you the gift from before, he’s a young master of a family known as the peerless medicine makers and doctors. If they couldn’t cure your father illness, then I believe no one in this room knows who really can.”</p>\n<p>“If I had a petty mind, young lady, I’d kill for the cosmetic you got from them. That’s how valuable their skills are,” Madam Sylvia said as she shook her head in pity.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh bit her lips. She was eloquent when she invited these experts months ago. Yet tonight, she had completely became tongue-tied and defeated. The cold air suddenly felt more unbearable. Although the warm meals’ delicious aroma wafted through the hall, not a single person had any incentive to touch their food. Everyone in the hall sunken into silence.</p>\n<p>“You want my advice, young lady?” the sharp voice of Sir Kurusiya sliced through the awkward atmosphere. He continued, “Having turned your back against Yashura Family is the dumbest decision you did. I didn’t come here because of you. I know your father, and I certainly know that swordsman from Yashura Family more. It’s a pity I couldn’t meet them today. Really, a complete waste miles and miles of journey.”</p>\n<p>With that, Sir Kurusiya, stood up and prepared to leave.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh quickly swallowed her bitterness, also stood up and said, “Please, Elder Kurusiya, let me see you the way out.”</p>\n<p>“No, don’t,” Sir Kurusiya flatly rejected her offer. “Sit down. These three fogies still haven’t decided what they want to do with you. Better think carefully about what you’re going to say to them next.”</p>\n<p>The eastern man saw himself out. Following his suggestion, Bhela Malikh sat down again and faced the three experts, with her mind suddenly became as blank as a barren field in the corner of abandoned land. She didn’t know what she ought to say to them, seeing the looks of pity they directed at her. Then, just when she managed to regain her bravery to say something, the door slammed open--</p>\n<p>“I come as the representative of Blackwood Family!” Young Master Frane Blackwood boldly yelled.</p>\n<p>He swagered himself in along with Elder Jhamil’s son and the adjutant of Blackwood Family under his wings. The arrogant behaviour of this young noble completely disregard the experts in the room. Madame Sylvia had enough. She dissed him, “What are you doing here uninvited?”</p>\n<p>Instead of the adjutant who usually spoke for his young master, it was the young elder of Malikh Family, Elder Jhamil’s son who replying. “This madam has eyes but doesn’t know what good for her. Of course Young Master Blackwood is invited! He’s the special guest of Malikh Family after all!”</p>\n<p>“What’s your name, boy?” the middle-aged woman hissed.</p>\n<p>“I’m Elder Jhamil’s eldest son! What’s up with you, you don’t have the right to know my name!”</p>\n<p>“Is that it? Very well. It seems just because I respect the southerner custom by dressing commonly you ignorant people already forgot what's best for you. Very well!”</p>\n<p><em>Zziiing!</em></p>\n<p>With a flashing draw of metallic sword, Madame Sylvia stood up to give this ignorant young elder a lesson. But her companion Mister Harrington quickly pulled her back before things really blown up.</p>\n<p>“You brought a weapon with you!” the Elder Jhamil’s son screamed with his finger pointing at Madame Sylvia who already trembling holding back her fury. “Do you not know what’s gonna happen to guests who bring weapons inside their host’s home?”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood rolled his eyes and told his adjutant, “Send this toad out of here, he’s too noisy!”</p>\n<p>“Right away,” the adjutant said. Then with his bony hands, he pulled the screaming Elder Jhamil’s son forcefully.</p>\n<p>“Is the discussion still ongoing?” Frane Blackwood asked the sitting guests as he tightened the blue necktie he wore. He said to Bhela, “Blackwood Family offers a lifetime terms of benefit for you, young lady. Not only medicines, if it boost potion you ask, or equipments, magic items, weapons--you name it, we have all things you’d dare to imagine!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho,” his uninvited offer gave Sir Baront Staterwind a chuckle. The three guests Bhela invited hailed from their own factions, so even if they wanted to rope Bhela in, they would consult with their higher ups about the specific terms they’d give to her as benefits. However, Blackwood Family was, in fact, only a noble family, not an organizational faction, with the only way in was through marriage--so of course the young noble would be able to offer a “lifetime benefits” to her so brazenly.</p>\n<p>“Thank you for holding back your anger, Madame Sylvia,” Bhela completely bowed her head to the angry guest while she completely disregarded Young Master Blackwood’s offers.</p>\n<p>Madame Sylvia nodded. She then looked at Young Master Blackwood and snorted. “Young lady, think carefully about what we said before. Some incapable people only able to spout honey trap to get what they want. Don’t be foolish because your father’s situation.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you for the advice…”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood wanted to argue with this lady. But he also held himself back as he didn’t know the other party’s identity. Therefore, all he could do was haughtily smiling elegantly as a proper noble as he was.</p>\n<p>“Has the discussion already started?” Frane Blackwood asked again. Pity him, not even one interested in answering. Because of that his face became red as he fumed with anger.</p>\n<p>“Ah,” Sir Baront Staterwind looked outside the window and slapped his thigh, “look how late it is! I planned to sleep early because I have something I need to do tomorrow early in the morning!”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh quickly offered to see him till the gate.</p>\n<p>“Hoho, how about you two?” Sir Baront asked the last two foreign experts, the pair of middle-aged man and woman, “overstaying your visit is considering a burden to these good Mossack folks, don’t you think so?”</p>\n<p>“I’m but an ignorant western lady, I know little about the way of the southern people, so please don’t mind us being shameless,” Madame Sylvia said. She then looked at Bhela, “Young Lady Bhela, Mister Harrington and I apparently haven’t booked our place in the village’s inns. We don’t know our talks would turned out dragged this late. For this I have to beg you to let us stay in Malikh Family for a few good days.”</p>\n<p>“Hoho…” Sir Baront Staterwind chuckled as he looked at the poker face pair of experts. Wasn’t the four of them--including Sir Kurusiya, checked in the same inn this afternoon? It was clear Madame Sylvia and Mister Harrington had their own intentions, thus Sir Baront Staterwind shrugged the idea of exposing their little white lies.</p>\n<p>And with that, Bhela Malikh led the three expert guests she invited out of the room. Young Master Blackwood, who was ignored so hard she almost exploded, yelling, “Young Lady Bhela!”</p>\n<p>Bhela turned around. “Yes, Young Master Blackwood?”</p>\n<p>“How about me?”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh blinked. Then she picked a bowl of roasted peanuts and approached him, saying softly, “Please sit down and enjoy this snack. I need to attend to my guests.”</p>\n<p>Hearing her soft, yet slightly cold voice, Young Lady Blackwood the understood something that made him excited, so excited he obediently sat down and nimbled on the roasted peanuts the beautiful Young Lady Bhela gave him.</p>\n<p>Then after Bhela brought the guests out, the Blackwood Family adjutant who was waiting outside came in inside the hall.</p>\n<p>“What are you doing?!” Young Master Blackwood hissed.</p>\n<p>The adjutant gawked. “Young master, I’m here to serve you…”</p>\n<p>“Serve me?” the young master cringed. What a joke! Soon he’d have a time being alone with Young Lady Bhela, and this old man wanted to be here right when he had the chance of his lifetime? What if there--during the discussion--was an accident where he had to be responsible as a man? Would he be happy if the adjutant was here when that happened?</p>\n<p>Absolutely not!</p>\n<p>“Get out! Don’t dawdle around here tonight! I need to discuss an important manner with Young Lady Bhela secretly!”</p>\n<p>“Y-young master--”</p>\n<p>“What are you waiting for! Go back to the inn and don’t bother me till the next morning!”</p>\n<p>The adjutant naturally understood what was inside the young master’s mind. He didn’t dare to linger around. With careful steps, he closed the door and went back to the inn Blackwood Family checked in.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Young Master Blackwood was so excited he couldn’t sit calmly alone in the hall. The thought of having private discussion with a girl as pretty as Bhela Malikh made him thinking a lot of things. Slowly, he getting horny.</p>\n<p>“What is taking her so long?” he mumbled to himself after waiting a fruitless thirty minutes. “Is it maybe she needs to… prepare, herself?”</p>\n<p>If it was going to be her first time, of course she needed time to prepare herself, Young Master Blackwood thought. This young noble had “befriend” and participating in “private discussions” with many experienced women. But virgin girls, he never tasted any.</p>\n<p>Because of that, he willing to wait however much longer for the young lady to prepare herself. And thus, after waiting for another thirty minutes, nothing happened. Nothing happened for the next hour as well. Then, after waiting for nearly three hours alone, the door finally opened…</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela, you finally ready!” Young Master Blackwood snapped out of his sleepy face and excitedly came to greet the visitor. Much to his disappointment, the visitor turned out to be the faithful adjutant.</p>\n<p>“Why is that you?!” Young Master Blackwood roared.</p>\n<p>“Y-young master… let’s get back to the inn,” the adjutant nervously asked.</p>\n<p>“Where’s Young Lady Bhela?”</p>\n<p>“She is in her room…”</p>\n<p>“Then you send someone there to ask her when she’s going to meet me,” the young noble ordered.</p>\n<p>“I’m afraid I can’t… young master…”</p>\n<p>“I’ve been waiting for hours, why?”</p>\n<p>The adjutant gulped before he replied.</p>\n<p>“Because the young lady has already gone sleeping since three hours ago!”</p>\n<p>So much for his dreamy private discussion! Young Master Blackwood was so angry for being misled that he slapped the adjutant’s face all the way back to his inn.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A single torch on a stick stubbornly lit the corner of the village in spite of the strong wind. A howling wolf in the distance reinforced the lone, cold sense of the midnight Badril Village. The only shop that still open at this hours could be counted with one hand, and this liquor shop was one of them. No customer visited it except a foreign eastern Kaya man.</p>\n<p>A series of step could be heard. The sleepy shopkeeper snapped back when he heard a new customer approaching.</p>\n<p>“Give me a glass of <em>tuak</em>, shopkeeper,” the new customer ordered with a booming voice. One could see his beardy feature when his face exposed to the shop’s lantern light. “Mind if I join you, Sir Kurusiya?”</p>\n<p>The eastern man didn’t reply. He drank his alcohol instead.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront Staterwind laughed by his cold treatment. The beardy guy was an easygoing person, so he casually grabbed a bowl of steamed peanuts and started to nibble on those snacks.</p>\n<p>“You’re not visiting Bhela’s father? You said you know him, you know, saying hi to a sick old buddy?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t say hi to a dying man,” Sir Kurusiya said.</p>\n<p>The answer made the air awkward. So Sir Baront quickly came with another topic.</p>\n<p>“It seems those two lovers adamant to protect the girl,” he said, referring to the other two experts who once were couple before Mister Harrington lost Madame Sylvia to another guy. “Or I think they just want some privacy to have some little reunion… who knows?”</p>\n<p>Sir Kurusiya never bothered with petty gossip, he callously replied, “They don’t know Malikh Family. They can’t protect her forever.”</p>\n<p>“Exactly,” Sir Baront Staterwind agreed. After that both men continued drinking without saying anything.</p>\n<p>“Hey shopkeeper,” Sir Baront called, “don’t you have anything with less alcohol? I have a business I’d like to deal with tomorrow, so I want to avoid shitty hangover.”</p>\n<p>“I have some sweet <em>tuak</em>,” the shopkeeper poured a new bottle into Sir Baront’s empty glass, “this one usually for them boys who haven’t gone coming of age ceremony. No alcohol, costs as little as four copper kobe coins.”</p>\n<p>“Four coppers, ah! Why’s that the souther I go the cheaper the drink?” he sipped it, “mm! Pretty good, my good man!”</p>\n<p>He tipped the shopkeeper with a silver coin. The shopkeeper was dumbfounded but quickly recovered and hid the coin safely.</p>\n<p>Sir Kurusiya said to Sir Baront, “You want to go to Yashura Family tomorrow?”</p>\n<p>“How did you know?”</p>\n<p>“Even though I can’t see him, I know the one who repelled Bhela’s arrow was a Nalaq,” Sir Kurusiya said.</p>\n<p>“Hoho, since I managed to rope in the young lady of Yurin Family, I’ve got promoted to an instructor,” Sir Baront smiled widely. “Doing the legwork isn’t my job anymore… but checking him and the boy won’t hurt, so I’m going. Hmm, I wonder if the Nalaq has already form his contract?”</p>\n<p>“Huuh…” the shopkeeper, who had been hearing their chatting, couldn’t help but asked, “you good sir, what’s this talking about a Nalaq having to do with Yashura Family?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, you’re a Yashura?” Sir Baront asked.</p>\n<p>“I’m Elzhier, from the outer family,” the shopkeeper said. “I’ve been in this village for forty years, but never I’ve heard any Nalaq passing by.”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, that’s why I’m going. Usually a rogue Nalaq isn’t someone tied with a faction, so they aren’t that big of deal--which also make them easier to rope in!”</p>\n<p>“Ooohh! Are you a Nalaq expert, mister? From overseas? Our family’s eldest young lady actually was scouted by a passing expert from overseas too, an expert from purple something sect!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, you mean Purple Garden Sect?” Sir Baront Staterwind and asked as he played along.</p>\n<p>But Sir Kurusiya was sceptic. “Purple Garden Sect is too far. And someone from that kind of superpower faction won’t be too idle to accidentally passing by on this kind of rural village.”</p>\n<p>Sir Baront nodded at Sir Kurusiya’s logic. Even if it was that particular sect that accepted the said young lady, both experts wouldn’t be too sure about whether she could be the sect’s legitimate disciple. Their doubts made the shopkeeper embarrassed. Since ten years ago, the tales of the eldest young lady of Elzhier Family being accepted by a foreign expert was a legend amongst Badril Village locals. Except her and the recent Malikh Family’s young lady, no one in the village was lucky got scouted to study oversea, so it became a fact that Elzhier Family was very proud of--and was one of the reasons why the Elzhier could win the village head’s seat from Yashura Family after their decades of leading Badril Village. But the problem was, in the letters their young lady sent home, she always talked about shops, fashions, and some other trivial stuffs that usually young women her age excited about. That made even her father, the current Elzhier Family’s patriarch and the Village Head, felt it was became difficult to still boasting the young lady’s status after ten years of her spending overseas.</p>\n<p>“But still, experts, you might not know this, but our eldest young lady was Young Lady of Malikh Family’s closest childhood friend! When Young Lady Bhela Malikh only a little girl our young lady gave her a lot of pointers and knowledge, so much that I assure that if it wasn’t for her being there for Young Lady Bhela, the Malikh Family wouldn’t get their talented Unique Class for at least the next one hundred years!”</p>\n<p>“Right…” Sir Baront became awkward instantly. To think some ignorant folks believed blessing of Unique Classes was that simple, even Sir Kurusiya scoffed at the idea.</p>\n<p>The shopkeeper’s face became red as he realized it was wise not to delay any longer. So he quickly said, “If you have some spare time, sir experts, I’m sure our Elzhier Family willing to entertain you!”</p>\n<p>After paying for their drinks, even the agreeable Sir Baront Staterwind felt it was very awkward for him to return to this little shop. Both decided not to get themselves involved with Elzhier Family after the shopkeeper’s little salesman talks, whilst not knowing the inn they stayed inn owned by Elzhier Family.</p>\n<p>On the way back, Sir Baront asked Sir Kurusiya for advice.</p>\n<p>“Yo, Kurusiya, I’m going to accept the Yashura boy as my third disciple if the Nalaq’s pretty good. But, you know, the Nalaq who contracted with youngest disciple is a master thirteen thousands years ago. She was a heavy weight figure, so I reckon I’ll let her calls the shot. What’s your opinion on this?”</p>\n<p>“How powerful is this Nalaq you’re talking about?”</p>\n<p>Sir Baront grinned. “You know the legend about Seven Pillars of Tiramikal Continent? She’s the Frost Mage mentioned in that history. Pretty neat, huh? She was able to revive as Nalaq and regained her consciousness five years ago. All the big shots in my Blue Robe Society can’t wait for the girl she’s contracted with to formally accepted into our faction.”</p>\n<p>“If that’s the case then your disciple isn’t necesserily worse than Malikh’s four elemental Archer girl.”</p>\n<p>“So you know why I can’t accept the boy if he’s too crude--I can’t afford to offend this madam Nalaq even the slightest bit.” he took out a bag of roasted peanuts he bought from the shopkeeper, and started to nibble on them. “I’m going to write a letter to my disciples, they’ve been playing around in the neighboring village. This madam Nalaq will come and check the boy herself.”</p>\n<p>Sir Kurusiya abruptly stopped his steps.</p>\n<p>“You want my advice?” he looked straight at Sir Baront’s eyes. “My advice is simple. You’re going to make this madam Nalaq of yours polite and you’re going to beg her to be mindful of her attitude in front of Yashura Family.”</p>\n<p>“You’re joking? You serious?”</p>\n<p>“I’m always serious,” Sir Kurusiya said.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Patriarch of Yashura Family, Shuro Yashura, was exhilarated to see Grandpa Piss and Snotty came to visit the village. One part because he treasured the friendships between their family and Grandpa Piss’s relatives, but mainly, he got to show-off his latest coconut cake recipe.</p>\n<p>“Ah, this is life, drinking <em>tuak</em> when we’re watching the moon, getting drunk while we’re eating coconuts. What a life!” Patriarch Shuro mumbled.</p>\n<p>“What a life indeed,” Grandpa Piss nodded with a low chuckle. On the sky, the full moon was shining bright really beautiful.</p>\n<p>After he’d done his part in ngajen ceremony, Patriarch Shuro Yashura accompanied the old Alchemist and his grandson in a spacious veranda, where they ate coconut cakes and drinking _tuak _while spending time moongazing. They had the Yashura Family’s sole butler, Yulong, to hold the _tuak _bottle and refilled their cups when empty.</p>\n<p>“Grandpa Piss, why didn’t you tell us beforehand before you visit Badril Village? We ran out of <em>rendang</em> before even the ceremony ended, so I’m sorry if you couldn’t eat <em>rendang</em>!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, we already ate chicken curry in Malikh Family, you don’t have to prepare food for us,” Grandpa Piss said.</p>\n<p>“How about breakfast? Are we still have leftover chickens, Yulong?”</p>\n<p>“We still have some leftover grilled village chicken, I’ll talk with the kitchen to reheat two portion first thing in the morning,” Yulong said.</p>\n<p>The Yashura Family’s patriarch was a role model of the stereotype Mossack people. He loved to cook and loved even more to feed people. It was no wonder why southern Mossacks’ visitors always felt welcomed whenever they visited the southern lands.</p>\n<p>“I sent them to bring <em>rendang</em> to Malikh Family, I never expected something like that to happen, hah!” Patriarch Shuro shook his head with a weak smile plastered on his face. During their talk, Grandpa Piss mentioned they met with Shira and Mila, as well mentioned the duel that happened between the two families’ young ladies and the upcoming duel between Shira and the young noble from Blackwood Family. “Whatever, if jerks wanted to fight with us, we won’t back down. Yashura Family never a coward!”</p>\n<p>“I believe Young Master Shira knows what he has to do,” Grandpa Piss assured.</p>\n<p>“I hope so, pity his father never around to hold the sky falling for him,” Patriarch Shuro gulped his <em>tuak</em>. “Anyway, let’s talk about something else. That Ghalim, you checked on him, Grandpa? What’s happened to him?”</p>\n<p>Snotty a little scared when Shuro Yashura suddenly brought up that topic. Snotty glanced at Butler Yulong’s wrinkled face, Yulong smiled back at him. The big muscle man couldn’t help but shuddered inside.</p>\n<p>“Patriarch Ghalim isn’t feeling well after eating some unhygienic food. I already prescribed some medicine for him, but I don’t know when he’d be able to get back at being patriarch since his digestive system was never good.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, is that so? Never knew he had something like that,” Patriarch Shuro mumbled. “There’s this really bad rumor about him being poisoned, Grandpa Piss, we never had something wicked like that in Badril Village.”</p>\n<p>“No, no no no, I can assure you, it’s not poison. I’ve been in the business more than seventy years--it’s <em>not</em> a poison.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss helped Yashura Family a lot when the patriarch’s in-law, Jhuro’s wife, had Shira in her belly. So Patriarch Shuro had long esteemed Grandpa Piss’s medicinal skill, even though he didn’t really had any idea how skillful the friendly old man was. He believed Grandpa Piss in the end.</p>\n<p>“We shouldn’t talk about sad things, Patriarch. Here, I bought a <em>tuak</em> my family handmade ourself. Let’s give it a try,” Grandpa Piss said.</p>\n<p>“Please, let me,” Butler Yulong asked the <em>tuak</em> bottle Grandpa Piss took out and poured it evenly to Patriarch Shuro’s, Grandpa Piss’s, along with Snotty’s glasses.</p>\n<p>The second thing Patriarch Shuro loved, after coconuts, was a strong <em>tuak</em>. He was the first one to gulp his glass clean, and he sighed about how good Grandpa Piss’s family <em>tuak</em> craft was. However, soon after that, his eyes somehow became heavy.</p>\n<p>“Huhh… usually, I still can drink till dawn…” Patriarch Shuro said with a yawn. “Let’s drink together… come on, Snotty, come drink with Uncle Shuro more.”</p>\n<p>“Patriarch, I think you are tired,” Yulong said softly, rejecting to pour patriarch’s glass.</p>\n<p>“Snotty, you go accompany Uncle Shuro inside,” Grandpa Piss said.</p>\n<p>Snotty nodded while still holding his glass full of <em>tuak</em>. The liquor was definitely mixed with something. Considering it was his grandfather who presented it, it was amazing to see Patriarch Shuro Yashura to be able to resist the urge to sleepiness. Snotty stood up and brought the yawning Shuro Yashura away.</p>\n<p>After both of them gone, Yulong picked up a clean glass. He poured the liquor that made Patriarch Shuro sleepy and drank it for himself. Grandpa Piss took out his second bottle and accompanied Yulong drinking <em>tuak</em>.</p>\n<p>“Is there’s something you need to discuss with me?” Yulong asked.</p>\n<p>“Indeed, it’s about Ghalim Malikh’s real condition…” Grandpa Piss didn’t leave any details when he told the Butler Yulong what had really happened in Malikh Family, particularly his discovery about the true nature of poison that made Patriarch Ghalim bedridden.</p>\n<p>When he heard that shocking fact, there was no surprise in the butler’s old face. Only sorrow and regret.</p>\n<p>“I knew this would happened,” Yulong sighed.</p>\n<p>“Then there’s Blackwood Family too…” Grandpa Piss’s sigh followed. “They seems interested in taking away Young Lady Bhela as a bride… I really don’t know what to say…”</p>\n<p>Yulong drank the <em>tuak</em> and told Grandpa Piss his reasoning, “That boy from Blackwood Family still hasn’t accepted Sir Jhuro’s decission to retire sixteen years ago. He’s been keeping quiet because he knew even the royalty and the organization behind him couldn’t protect him from Old Sir Lharu’s and Old Madam Sari’s retrubution. Time’s change. I reckon there’s some change somewhere that make him cocky.”</p>\n<p>“Old Sir and Old Madam too far away to give help in case something like this happens suddenly. Should I help you and Sir Jhuro keeping tabs on Blackwood Family?” Grandpa Piss asked.</p>\n<p>While Jhuro Yashura left behind resources and men outside before he retired, he almost never interacted with the high society of nobility. For ears and eyes to reach those fancy places, it would take time and efforts for current Yulong and Shuro Yashura to do so. It was way better to ask Grandpa Piss who already familiar due to his family’s generations of Alchemist profession. However, Yulong rejected the offer without giving it a real thought.</p>\n<p>“You don’t need to worry. Blackwood Family only taking a ride of that boy’s ambition. If he really supports his foster family right from the start, Blackwood won’t be stuck with their viscount nobility rank.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss wanted to offer any more help, but he long sensed the old butler’s distrust of him on affairs that didn’t include medicines and elixirs. So he kept his mouth shut for the time being.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, a golden owl landed on the veranda where the two old men enjoyed their <em>tuak</em>. The own brought a small piece of paper and inked quill with it.</p>\n<p>“Go, send this message to Sir Jhuro, as fast as possible!” Butler Yulong said to the owl after he wrote his tiny letter. Then he glanced at Grandpa Piss and said, “this is an owl I keep around in case there’s an emergency. Sir Jhuro also brought one with him.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss nodded with a painful smile. This golden owl was long thought to be extinct, but the reality there were small amounts of them were being kept in case of emergencies. They were rare, almost becoming birds of legend. Small to medium sized kingdoms wouldn’t dare to think getting their hands on it, not to mention Grandpa Piss’s own family. But this old butler had one with him. And the prodigial man of Yashura Family casually brought this treasure bird with him to travel around the southern land.</p>\n<p>“This is really for emergency,” Yulong said coldly, knowing full well the old Alchemist’s envy.</p>\n<p>“I know, I know--for emergency.”</p>\n<p>The owl then flew away bringing Yulong’s letter.</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss and Snotty returned back to their own village the next morning. After sending them away, Yulong found out the young master, Shira Yashura, wanted to go to the market to pick some goods for his contracted pedlers to sell. He was worried the young master’s inexperience getting him exploited. Therefore, he waited in the gate and followed the boy from behind.</p>\n<p>In front of an inn owned by Elzhier Family, Yulong saw a familiar eastern Kaya man came out with a respectable, but humble Mossack man behind him. The Kaya man, Sir Kurusiya, noticed Yulong, immediately cupped his fist and bowed his body. That was a salute of great respect eastern Kaya men usually give to people they regard highly. Sir Baront Staterwind didn’t know what was going on, so he imitated his companion to salute Yulong even though he didn’t really know he was only a butler.</p>\n<p>“You know them, Yulong?” Shira asked.</p>\n<p>“The Kaya man once works in the same place as your father, young master.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, that’s why you know him.” Yulong was his mother helper, and his father brought him along to Yashura Family when Shira still in his mother’s belly. Shira never liked to listen about his father’s past, even though it was often glorified since he was completely stopped marauding bandits from approaching Badril Village. Walking toward the market, Shira kept quiet and didn’t ask the matter any further.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Far away from Badril Village, the golden owl Yulong tasked with the emergency letter flew through walls of mist and mountains. It instinctively knew the location of its recipient, Jhuro Yashura, even though Yulong wasn’t necesserarily knew where he was. Not even a half day passed by since the bird took off from Yashura Family, it flew already more than halfway toward its destination.</p>\n<p>Its speed was unprecendeted amongst the magical beast. No wonder commonfolks thought it was the bird of the legend. It was a shame that it failed to detect a single flash on the horizon, resulting it to succumb to a terrible fate.</p>\n<p><em>Flap flap flap!</em></p>\n<p>The owl futilely tried to avoid danger.</p>\n<p>A single flash all it took to capture the dumbfounded owl. A pair of cold talons gripped its short neck and the next thing it knew, the owl panically flapping its wings in search of oxygen, only to be deprived of fresh air even more. The owl couldn’t see the beast, it only saw a dashingly crimson flash before it was captured by the neck. The hostile beast scretched, only after that the owl realized a damned predator eagle already got it. Annoyed by the owl’s desperate struggle, the eagle broke its neck. The handsome crimson-colored eagle then delivered the dead owl to a mysterious masked man, who then passed it to another man--a pale, thin man who only dressed himself as black as the phantom itself.</p>\n<p>“This owl coming out from Yashura Family, Mister Blackwood. The bird brings a letter with it,” the masked man said as he presented the letter to the pale man.</p>\n<p>“Ah, so they figured it out about the poison,” the pale man with Blackwood surname said. Beside him and the masked man, there was a third man who drained the blood of the golden owl, prepared a little feast of its dead body. The man was very peculiar; bald, with veined oversized muscles that looked like it was almost exploded, and the strange tatooes that covered its body. He was a northern barbarian, the kind that never took orders from civilized men no matter they came from the west, south, or the east. Yet, when the Blackwood guy told him top plucking the dead owl, he obidiently put aside the carcass, not daring to show any hints of disatisfaction.</p>\n<p>“Mister, the young lady of Malikh Family turns out to be a four-elemental Unique Class, she’s a real talent with tremendous potential--your sister tries to take her to Blackwood Family and having a setback because there’s some experts happened to visit Malikh Family. Shall we send anymore resources to help her?”</p>\n<p>“What’s her Blackwood Family have to do with me? It’s already good enough I let her to use my name to coerce people and strengthen her influence in commerce world. She’s getting annoying every time she’s using my toys. That Jhuju’s poison I sent to her only a reminder to Ghalim of our old friendship, my sister should be thankful enough if she gets some benefits from it.”</p>\n<p>The masked man knew the pale man was irritated by his sister’s cockiness. So he excused himself and brought the crimson eagle with him, disappearing into the shadow.</p>\n<p>“We’ve rested enough,” the pale man said as he crumbled the small letter he read. The bald barbarian’s head cocked and he await the order. “Prepare the horses,” the man continued, “I’ve got an old friend I should say hi to.”</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-3/chapter-5":"<authors-note id=\"Radhy\" type=\"danger\">\n<p>I don’t recommend reading from here onwards because the chapter below is still from the previous draft, which is different from the previous 4 chapters. Further edits will be made that most likely makes this chapter quite different than the current one.</p>\n</authors-note>\n<p>In a certain hall in Malikh Family’s left wing complex, four people sat idly on the bamboo mats covered floor. They were being served local-specialty ginger drinks mixed with brown sugar with herbs to drink. There were also some roasted peanuts to chew. Despite they dressed humbly when attending the Ngajen Ceremony, three of them were elders with statuses, while one of them, the sword bearing Kaya man, wasn’t anyone to ignore either.</p>\n<p>Having knowing this, they still waiting for their host, Bhela Malikh, to wrap up the Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>“Still,” Madame Sylvia said after a sip of ginger drink, “I wouldn’t have expected the girl’s talent to be that rare when she approached my sect with the invitation. The top brass only interested of her being the top grade during the seminar thus sent me to check her out. How about you, Mister Harrington?”</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t expecting it either. I only interested when the report said she showed a potential of being two elemental-affinities Archer. Three already great, but with four elementals, chances she’ll get her name down in history books.”</p>\n<p>“That is what happen if she able to live long enough to develop her full potential,” the quiet man with sharp aura remarked. His face was thin, rough, and since he never liked to smile, he always looked like he meant business. The man was role model of eastern Kaya race ancient warriors--stand and sit in straight posture, humorless, and most importantly, always bringing the sharp, thin sword of katana on his hips.</p>\n<p>Madame Sylvia was interested on his remark. So she asked, “Oh, why you think of that, Sir Kurusiya?”</p>\n<p>The eastern man replied, “Because she tangled herself with Blackwood Family,” he paused. “If this Blackwood the same one from this Blackwood guy I know, then it’s definitely a bad news for her.”</p>\n<p>Mister Harrington from Elemental Stone School disagreed.</p>\n<p>“Since when our factions become soft?” he questioned. “We’re not that pitiful to handle some second-rate noble family. Honestly, I think that young man from that Blackwood Family such a pest. If Young Lady Bhela asks for my favor, I’ll handle him cleanly and thoroughly--right here, right now.”</p>\n<p>“I’m not talking about Blackwood Family, I’m talking about the creepy guy with Blackwood as his last name,” Sir Kurusiya said as he put down his ginger drink. He wasn’t happy, so Madame Sylvia signaled Mister Harrington that it best not to continue arguing with the scary eastern Kaya man.</p>\n<p>The hall suddenly turned quiet. Then, the fourth man was happily enjoyed his drink, out of the blue he blurted for his opinion that no one asked for. “That boy from Yashura Family is sure interesting…”</p>\n<p>Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia smiled wryly. Nobody said anything about Yashura Family up until now. The fourth man, Baront Staterwind, came from a very peculiar faction. Which actually had nothing to do with Bhela’s type of talent. Even when he had already came to Badril Village, none would think he accepted Bhela Malikh’s invitation just to scout her talent.</p>\n<p>The hall’s door was knocked. Bhela entered. She politely greeted the four respected guests before she sat down.</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry for the wait, dear elders. Malikh Family hasn’t prepared the best dishes for you during the ceremony, so I asked the best chef we have to cook special meals for you,” Bhela said, then she glanced at the door. “Please enter, aunty!”</p>\n<p>The moment she called, a middle-aged woman who helped Bhela in the kitchen before came with a line of maidservants, bringing freshly cooked dinner meals with them. It was better than what the Malikhs served for the guests before, even compared to the meals served for the family’s important guests cooked by Bhela as the chief chef.</p>\n<p>“I rather you serve me some alcohol,” the eastern Sir Kurusiya said to her.</p>\n<p>Bhela nodded at his request and asked the aunty to fetch the best alcohol she could find. Of course, the best person to get help was the elder who provided Bhela with the hall to host her guests. Bhela hoped the said elder already knew the importance of this meeting thus not being stingy with his alcohol collection.</p>\n<p>“Can we start now, young lady? I don’t have a good alcohol tolerance so I rather get this completed before us adults get to drink,” Madame Sylvia said.</p>\n<p>“We have delicious food here served, Madame Sylvia. To be honest, all the wait before is for the aunties preparing dinner for dear elders,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>But not of the adults believed her words easily.</p>\n<p>“Hoho, you seem so nervous, young lady. You might not look like it, but you seem about to cry,” Sir Baront Staterwind said.</p>\n<p>“Just state what you want from us, don’t waste anymore time,” Sir Kurusiya urged.</p>\n<p>Bhela lowered her head. With her lips tremblingly parted, she said, “As you might know, my father fell ill when I was overseas attending the seminar. My mother has contacted many doctors and alchemists to make medicines for him, yet my father’s condition never improved. I request for elders’ wisdom and strength, please help my poor father, he was in misery for months…”</p>\n<p>Bhela prostated.</p>\n<p>“Please, help me father… he’s dying… please…” she begged.</p>\n<p>Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia exchanged glances. The peculiar beardy man, Sir Baront, merely nodded without letting his thoughts known. Meanwhile, Sir Kurusiya, who didn’t bulge seeing the pretty girl begging in front of him, coldly said, “Well, this is really a waste of time.”</p>\n<p>Hearing the eastern man snorted, Bhela’s heart went cold. She prepared herself bowing down for help, without stating a single offer to prove how desperate herself.</p>\n<p>“And, young lady…” Madame Sylvia asked slowly, “what would you do if someone managed to heal your father?”</p>\n<p>Bhela rose up. She looked straight to Madam Sylvia’s gaze, then said, “Anything,”</p>\n<p>“Anything?”</p>\n<p>“Anything.”</p>\n<p>The room went quiet. Only Mister Harrington’s regretful sigh could be heard.</p>\n<p>It was Sir Baront Staterwind who explained with a good intention, “It really seems you haven’t grasped the situation you were in, young lady. The guest who gave you the gift from before, he’s a young master of a family known as the peerless medicine makers and doctors. If they couldn’t cure your father illness, then I believe no one in this room knows who really can.”</p>\n<p>“If I had a petty mind, young lady, I’d kill for the cosmetic you got from them. That’s how valuable their skills are,” Madam Sylvia said as she shook her head in pity.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh bit her lips. She was eloquent when she invited these experts months ago. Yet tonight, she had completely became tongue-tied and defeated. The cold air suddenly felt more unbearable. Although the warm meals’ delicious aroma wafted through the hall, not a single person had any incentive to touch their food. Everyone in the hall sunken into silence.</p>\n<p>“You want my advice, young lady?” the sharp voice of Sir Kurusiya sliced through the awkward atmosphere. He continued, “Having turned your back against Yashura Family is the dumbest decision you did. I didn’t come here because of you. I know your father, and I certainly know that swordsman from Yashura Family more. It’s a pity I couldn’t meet them today. Really, a complete waste miles and miles of journey.”</p>\n<p>With that, Sir Kurusiya, stood up and prepared to leave.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh quickly swallowed her bitterness, also stood up and said, “Please, Elder Kurusiya, let me see you the way out.”</p>\n<p>“No, don’t,” Sir Kurusiya flatly rejected her offer. “Sit down. These three fogies still haven’t decided what they want to do with you. Better think carefully about what you’re going to say to them next.”</p>\n<p>The eastern man saw himself out. Following his suggestion, Bhela Malikh sat down again and faced the three experts, with her mind suddenly became as blank as a barren field in the corner of abandoned land. She didn’t know what she ought to say to them, seeing the looks of pity they directed at her. Then, just when she managed to regain her bravery to say something, the door slammed open--</p>\n<p>“I come as the representative of Blackwood Family!” Young Master Frane Blackwood boldly yelled.</p>\n<p>He swagered himself in along with Elder Jhamil’s son and the adjutant of Blackwood Family under his wings. The arrogant behaviour of this young noble completely disregard the experts in the room. Madame Sylvia had enough. She dissed him, “What are you doing here uninvited?”</p>\n<p>Instead of the adjutant who usually spoke for his young master, it was the young elder of Malikh Family, Elder Jhamil’s son who replying. “This madam has eyes but doesn’t know what good for her. Of course Young Master Blackwood is invited! He’s the special guest of Malikh Family after all!”</p>\n<p>“What’s your name, boy?” the middle-aged woman hissed.</p>\n<p>“I’m Elder Jhamil’s eldest son! What’s up with you, you don’t have the right to know my name!”</p>\n<p>“Is that it? Very well. It seems just because I respect the southerner custom by dressing commonly you ignorant people already forgot what's best for you. Very well!”</p>\n<p><em>Zziiing!</em></p>\n<p>With a flashing draw of metallic sword, Madame Sylvia stood up to give this ignorant young elder a lesson. But her companion Mister Harrington quickly pulled her back before things really blown up.</p>\n<p>“You brought a weapon with you!” the Elder Jhamil’s son screamed with his finger pointing at Madame Sylvia who already trembling holding back her fury. “Do you not know what’s gonna happen to guests who bring weapons inside their host’s home?”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood rolled his eyes and told his adjutant, “Send this toad out of here, he’s too noisy!”</p>\n<p>“Right away,” the adjutant said. Then with his bony hands, he pulled the screaming Elder Jhamil’s son forcefully.</p>\n<p>“Is the discussion still ongoing?” Frane Blackwood asked the sitting guests as he tightened the blue necktie he wore. He said to Bhela, “Blackwood Family offers a lifetime terms of benefit for you, young lady. Not only medicines, if it boost potion you ask, or equipments, magic items, weapons--you name it, we have all things you’d dare to imagine!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho,” his uninvited offer gave Sir Baront Staterwind a chuckle. The three guests Bhela invited hailed from their own factions, so even if they wanted to rope Bhela in, they would consult with their higher ups about the specific terms they’d give to her as benefits. However, Blackwood Family was, in fact, only a noble family, not an organizational faction, with the only way in was through marriage--so of course the young noble would be able to offer a “lifetime benefits” to her so brazenly.</p>\n<p>“Thank you for holding back your anger, Madame Sylvia,” Bhela completely bowed her head to the angry guest while she completely disregarded Young Master Blackwood’s offers.</p>\n<p>Madame Sylvia nodded. She then looked at Young Master Blackwood and snorted. “Young lady, think carefully about what we said before. Some incapable people only able to spout honey trap to get what they want. Don’t be foolish because your father’s situation.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you for the advice…”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood wanted to argue with this lady. But he also held himself back as he didn’t know the other party’s identity. Therefore, all he could do was haughtily smiling elegantly as a proper noble as he was.</p>\n<p>“Has the discussion already started?” Frane Blackwood asked again. Pity him, not even one interested in answering. Because of that his face became red as he fumed with anger.</p>\n<p>“Ah,” Sir Baront Staterwind looked outside the window and slapped his thigh, “look how late it is! I planned to sleep early because I have something I need to do tomorrow early in the morning!”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh quickly offered to see him till the gate.</p>\n<p>“Hoho, how about you two?” Sir Baront asked the last two foreign experts, the pair of middle-aged man and woman, “overstaying your visit is considering a burden to these good Mossack folks, don’t you think so?”</p>\n<p>“I’m but an ignorant western lady, I know little about the way of the southern people, so please don’t mind us being shameless,” Madame Sylvia said. She then looked at Bhela, “Young Lady Bhela, Mister Harrington and I apparently haven’t booked our place in the village’s inns. We don’t know our talks would turned out dragged this late. For this I have to beg you to let us stay in Malikh Family for a few good days.”</p>\n<p>“Hoho…” Sir Baront Staterwind chuckled as he looked at the poker face pair of experts. Wasn’t the four of them--including Sir Kurusiya, checked in the same inn this afternoon? It was clear Madame Sylvia and Mister Harrington had their own intentions, thus Sir Baront Staterwind shrugged the idea of exposing their little white lies.</p>\n<p>And with that, Bhela Malikh led the three expert guests she invited out of the room. Young Master Blackwood, who was ignored so hard she almost exploded, yelling, “Young Lady Bhela!”</p>\n<p>Bhela turned around. “Yes, Young Master Blackwood?”</p>\n<p>“How about me?”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh blinked. Then she picked a bowl of roasted peanuts and approached him, saying softly, “Please sit down and enjoy this snack. I need to attend to my guests.”</p>\n<p>Hearing her soft, yet slightly cold voice, Young Lady Blackwood the understood something that made him excited, so excited he obediently sat down and nimbled on the roasted peanuts the beautiful Young Lady Bhela gave him.</p>\n<p>Then after Bhela brought the guests out, the Blackwood Family adjutant who was waiting outside came in inside the hall.</p>\n<p>“What are you doing?!” Young Master Blackwood hissed.</p>\n<p>The adjutant gawked. “Young master, I’m here to serve you…”</p>\n<p>“Serve me?” the young master cringed. What a joke! Soon he’d have a time being alone with Young Lady Bhela, and this old man wanted to be here right when he had the chance of his lifetime? What if there--during the discussion--was an accident where he had to be responsible as a man? Would he be happy if the adjutant was here when that happened?</p>\n<p>Absolutely not!</p>\n<p>“Get out! Don’t dawdle around here tonight! I need to discuss an important manner with Young Lady Bhela secretly!”</p>\n<p>“Y-young master--”</p>\n<p>“What are you waiting for! Go back to the inn and don’t bother me till the next morning!”</p>\n<p>The adjutant naturally understood what was inside the young master’s mind. He didn’t dare to linger around. With careful steps, he closed the door and went back to the inn Blackwood Family checked in.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Young Master Blackwood was so excited he couldn’t sit calmly alone in the hall. The thought of having private discussion with a girl as pretty as Bhela Malikh made him thinking a lot of things. Slowly, he getting horny.</p>\n<p>“What is taking her so long?” he mumbled to himself after waiting a fruitless thirty minutes. “Is it maybe she needs to… prepare, herself?”</p>\n<p>If it was going to be her first time, of course she needed time to prepare herself, Young Master Blackwood thought. This young noble had “befriend” and participating in “private discussions” with many experienced women. But virgin girls, he never tasted any.</p>\n<p>Because of that, he willing to wait however much longer for the young lady to prepare herself. And thus, after waiting for another thirty minutes, nothing happened. Nothing happened for the next hour as well. Then, after waiting for nearly three hours alone, the door finally opened…</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela, you finally ready!” Young Master Blackwood snapped out of his sleepy face and excitedly came to greet the visitor. Much to his disappointment, the visitor turned out to be the faithful adjutant.</p>\n<p>“Why is that you?!” Young Master Blackwood roared.</p>\n<p>“Y-young master… let’s get back to the inn,” the adjutant nervously asked.</p>\n<p>“Where’s Young Lady Bhela?”</p>\n<p>“She is in her room…”</p>\n<p>“Then you send someone there to ask her when she’s going to meet me,” the young noble ordered.</p>\n<p>“I’m afraid I can’t… young master…”</p>\n<p>“I’ve been waiting for hours, why?”</p>\n<p>The adjutant gulped before he replied.</p>\n<p>“Because the young lady has already gone sleeping since three hours ago!”</p>\n<p>So much for his dreamy private discussion! Young Master Blackwood was so angry for being misled that he slapped the adjutant’s face all the way back to his inn.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A single torch on a stick stubbornly lit the corner of the village in spite of the strong wind. A howling wolf in the distance reinforced the lone, cold sense of the midnight Badril Village. The only shop that still open at this hours could be counted with one hand, and this liquor shop was one of them. No customer visited it except a foreign eastern Kaya man.</p>\n<p>A series of step could be heard. The sleepy shopkeeper snapped back when he heard a new customer approaching.</p>\n<p>“Give me a glass of <em>tuak</em>, shopkeeper,” the new customer ordered with a booming voice. One could see his beardy feature when his face exposed to the shop’s lantern light. “Mind if I join you, Sir Kurusiya?”</p>\n<p>The eastern man didn’t reply. He drank his alcohol instead.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront Staterwind laughed by his cold treatment. The beardy guy was an easygoing person, so he casually grabbed a bowl of steamed peanuts and started to nibble on those snacks.</p>\n<p>“You’re not visiting Bhela’s father? You said you know him, you know, saying hi to a sick old buddy?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t say hi to a dying man,” Sir Kurusiya said.</p>\n<p>The answer made the air awkward. So Sir Baront quickly came with another topic.</p>\n<p>“It seems those two lovers adamant to protect the girl,” he said, referring to the other two experts who once were couple before Mister Harrington lost Madame Sylvia to another guy. “Or I think they just want some privacy to have some little reunion… who knows?”</p>\n<p>Sir Kurusiya never bothered with petty gossip, he callously replied, “They don’t know Malikh Family. They can’t protect her forever.”</p>\n<p>“Exactly,” Sir Baront Staterwind agreed. After that both men continued drinking without saying anything.</p>\n<p>“Hey shopkeeper,” Sir Baront called, “don’t you have anything with less alcohol? I have a business I’d like to deal with tomorrow, so I want to avoid shitty hangover.”</p>\n<p>“I have some sweet <em>tuak</em>,” the shopkeeper poured a new bottle into Sir Baront’s empty glass, “this one usually for them boys who haven’t gone coming of age ceremony. No alcohol, costs as little as four copper kobe coins.”</p>\n<p>“Four coppers, ah! Why’s that the souther I go the cheaper the drink?” he sipped it, “mm! Pretty good, my good man!”</p>\n<p>He tipped the shopkeeper with a silver coin. The shopkeeper was dumbfounded but quickly recovered and hid the coin safely.</p>\n<p>Sir Kurusiya said to Sir Baront, “You want to go to Yashura Family tomorrow?”</p>\n<p>“How did you know?”</p>\n<p>“Even though I can’t see him, I know the one who repelled Bhela’s arrow was a Nalaq,” Sir Kurusiya said.</p>\n<p>“Hoho, since I managed to rope in the young lady of Yurin Family, I’ve got promoted to an instructor,” Sir Baront smiled widely. “Doing the legwork isn’t my job anymore… but checking him and the boy won’t hurt, so I’m going. Hmm, I wonder if the Nalaq has already form his contract?”</p>\n<p>“Huuh…” the shopkeeper, who had been hearing their chatting, couldn’t help but asked, “you good sir, what’s this talking about a Nalaq having to do with Yashura Family?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, you’re a Yashura?” Sir Baront asked.</p>\n<p>“I’m Elzhier, from the outer family,” the shopkeeper said. “I’ve been in this village for forty years, but never I’ve heard any Nalaq passing by.”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, that’s why I’m going. Usually a rogue Nalaq isn’t someone tied with a faction, so they aren’t that big of deal--which also make them easier to rope in!”</p>\n<p>“Ooohh! Are you a Nalaq expert, mister? From overseas? Our family’s eldest young lady actually was scouted by a passing expert from overseas too, an expert from purple something sect!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, you mean Purple Garden Sect?” Sir Baront Staterwind and asked as he played along.</p>\n<p>But Sir Kurusiya was sceptic. “Purple Garden Sect is too far. And someone from that kind of superpower faction won’t be too idle to accidentally passing by on this kind of rural village.”</p>\n<p>Sir Baront nodded at Sir Kurusiya’s logic. Even if it was that particular sect that accepted the said young lady, both experts wouldn’t be too sure about whether she could be the sect’s legitimate disciple. Their doubts made the shopkeeper embarrassed. Since ten years ago, the tales of the eldest young lady of Elzhier Family being accepted by a foreign expert was a legend amongst Badril Village locals. Except her and the recent Malikh Family’s young lady, no one in the village was lucky got scouted to study oversea, so it became a fact that Elzhier Family was very proud of--and was one of the reasons why the Elzhier could win the village head’s seat from Yashura Family after their decades of leading Badril Village. But the problem was, in the letters their young lady sent home, she always talked about shops, fashions, and some other trivial stuffs that usually young women her age excited about. That made even her father, the current Elzhier Family’s patriarch and the Village Head, felt it was became difficult to still boasting the young lady’s status after ten years of her spending overseas.</p>\n<p>“But still, experts, you might not know this, but our eldest young lady was Young Lady of Malikh Family’s closest childhood friend! When Young Lady Bhela Malikh only a little girl our young lady gave her a lot of pointers and knowledge, so much that I assure that if it wasn’t for her being there for Young Lady Bhela, the Malikh Family wouldn’t get their talented Unique Class for at least the next one hundred years!”</p>\n<p>“Right…” Sir Baront became awkward instantly. To think some ignorant folks believed blessing of Unique Classes was that simple, even Sir Kurusiya scoffed at the idea.</p>\n<p>The shopkeeper’s face became red as he realized it was wise not to delay any longer. So he quickly said, “If you have some spare time, sir experts, I’m sure our Elzhier Family willing to entertain you!”</p>\n<p>After paying for their drinks, even the agreeable Sir Baront Staterwind felt it was very awkward for him to return to this little shop. Both decided not to get themselves involved with Elzhier Family after the shopkeeper’s little salesman talks, whilst not knowing the inn they stayed inn owned by Elzhier Family.</p>\n<p>On the way back, Sir Baront asked Sir Kurusiya for advice.</p>\n<p>“Yo, Kurusiya, I’m going to accept the Yashura boy as my third disciple if the Nalaq’s pretty good. But, you know, the Nalaq who contracted with youngest disciple is a master thirteen thousands years ago. She was a heavy weight figure, so I reckon I’ll let her calls the shot. What’s your opinion on this?”</p>\n<p>“How powerful is this Nalaq you’re talking about?”</p>\n<p>Sir Baront grinned. “You know the legend about Seven Pillars of Tiramikal Continent? She’s the Frost Mage mentioned in that history. Pretty neat, huh? She was able to revive as Nalaq and regained her consciousness five years ago. All the big shots in my Blue Robe Society can’t wait for the girl she’s contracted with to formally accepted into our faction.”</p>\n<p>“If that’s the case then your disciple isn’t necesserily worse than Malikh’s four elemental Archer girl.”</p>\n<p>“So you know why I can’t accept the boy if he’s too crude--I can’t afford to offend this madam Nalaq even the slightest bit.” he took out a bag of roasted peanuts he bought from the shopkeeper, and started to nibble on them. “I’m going to write a letter to my disciples, they’ve been playing around in the neighboring village. This madam Nalaq will come and check the boy herself.”</p>\n<p>Sir Kurusiya abruptly stopped his steps.</p>\n<p>“You want my advice?” he looked straight at Sir Baront’s eyes. “My advice is simple. You’re going to make this madam Nalaq of yours polite and you’re going to beg her to be mindful of her attitude in front of Yashura Family.”</p>\n<p>“You’re joking? You serious?”</p>\n<p>“I’m always serious,” Sir Kurusiya said.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Patriarch of Yashura Family, Shuro Yashura, was exhilarated to see Grandpa Piss and Snotty came to visit the village. One part because he treasured the friendships between their family and Grandpa Piss’s relatives, but mainly, he got to show-off his latest coconut cake recipe.</p>\n<p>“Ah, this is life, drinking <em>tuak</em> when we’re watching the moon, getting drunk while we’re eating coconuts. What a life!” Patriarch Shuro mumbled.</p>\n<p>“What a life indeed,” Grandpa Piss nodded with a low chuckle. On the sky, the full moon was shining bright really beautiful.</p>\n<p>After he’d done his part in ngajen ceremony, Patriarch Shuro Yashura accompanied the old Alchemist and his grandson in a spacious veranda, where they ate coconut cakes and drinking _tuak _while spending time moongazing. They had the Yashura Family’s sole butler, Yulong, to hold the _tuak _bottle and refilled their cups when empty.</p>\n<p>“Grandpa Piss, why didn’t you tell us beforehand before you visit Badril Village? We ran out of <em>rendang</em> before even the ceremony ended, so I’m sorry if you couldn’t eat <em>rendang</em>!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, we already ate chicken curry in Malikh Family, you don’t have to prepare food for us,” Grandpa Piss said.</p>\n<p>“How about breakfast? Are we still have leftover chickens, Yulong?”</p>\n<p>“We still have some leftover grilled village chicken, I’ll talk with the kitchen to reheat two portion first thing in the morning,” Yulong said.</p>\n<p>The Yashura Family’s patriarch was a role model of the stereotype Mossack people. He loved to cook and loved even more to feed people. It was no wonder why southern Mossacks’ visitors always felt welcomed whenever they visited the southern lands.</p>\n<p>“I sent them to bring <em>rendang</em> to Malikh Family, I never expected something like that to happen, hah!” Patriarch Shuro shook his head with a weak smile plastered on his face. During their talk, Grandpa Piss mentioned they met with Shira and Mila, as well mentioned the duel that happened between the two families’ young ladies and the upcoming duel between Shira and the young noble from Blackwood Family. “Whatever, if jerks wanted to fight with us, we won’t back down. Yashura Family never a coward!”</p>\n<p>“I believe Young Master Shira knows what he has to do,” Grandpa Piss assured.</p>\n<p>“I hope so, pity his father never around to hold the sky falling for him,” Patriarch Shuro gulped his <em>tuak</em>. “Anyway, let’s talk about something else. That Ghalim, you checked on him, Grandpa? What’s happened to him?”</p>\n<p>Snotty a little scared when Shuro Yashura suddenly brought up that topic. Snotty glanced at Butler Yulong’s wrinkled face, Yulong smiled back at him. The big muscle man couldn’t help but shuddered inside.</p>\n<p>“Patriarch Ghalim isn’t feeling well after eating some unhygienic food. I already prescribed some medicine for him, but I don’t know when he’d be able to get back at being patriarch since his digestive system was never good.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, is that so? Never knew he had something like that,” Patriarch Shuro mumbled. “There’s this really bad rumor about him being poisoned, Grandpa Piss, we never had something wicked like that in Badril Village.”</p>\n<p>“No, no no no, I can assure you, it’s not poison. I’ve been in the business more than seventy years--it’s <em>not</em> a poison.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss helped Yashura Family a lot when the patriarch’s in-law, Jhuro’s wife, had Shira in her belly. So Patriarch Shuro had long esteemed Grandpa Piss’s medicinal skill, even though he didn’t really had any idea how skillful the friendly old man was. He believed Grandpa Piss in the end.</p>\n<p>“We shouldn’t talk about sad things, Patriarch. Here, I bought a <em>tuak</em> my family handmade ourself. Let’s give it a try,” Grandpa Piss said.</p>\n<p>“Please, let me,” Butler Yulong asked the <em>tuak</em> bottle Grandpa Piss took out and poured it evenly to Patriarch Shuro’s, Grandpa Piss’s, along with Snotty’s glasses.</p>\n<p>The second thing Patriarch Shuro loved, after coconuts, was a strong <em>tuak</em>. He was the first one to gulp his glass clean, and he sighed about how good Grandpa Piss’s family <em>tuak</em> craft was. However, soon after that, his eyes somehow became heavy.</p>\n<p>“Huhh… usually, I still can drink till dawn…” Patriarch Shuro said with a yawn. “Let’s drink together… come on, Snotty, come drink with Uncle Shuro more.”</p>\n<p>“Patriarch, I think you are tired,” Yulong said softly, rejecting to pour patriarch’s glass.</p>\n<p>“Snotty, you go accompany Uncle Shuro inside,” Grandpa Piss said.</p>\n<p>Snotty nodded while still holding his glass full of <em>tuak</em>. The liquor was definitely mixed with something. Considering it was his grandfather who presented it, it was amazing to see Patriarch Shuro Yashura to be able to resist the urge to sleepiness. Snotty stood up and brought the yawning Shuro Yashura away.</p>\n<p>After both of them gone, Yulong picked up a clean glass. He poured the liquor that made Patriarch Shuro sleepy and drank it for himself. Grandpa Piss took out his second bottle and accompanied Yulong drinking <em>tuak</em>.</p>\n<p>“Is there’s something you need to discuss with me?” Yulong asked.</p>\n<p>“Indeed, it’s about Ghalim Malikh’s real condition…” Grandpa Piss didn’t leave any details when he told the Butler Yulong what had really happened in Malikh Family, particularly his discovery about the true nature of poison that made Patriarch Ghalim bedridden.</p>\n<p>When he heard that shocking fact, there was no surprise in the butler’s old face. Only sorrow and regret.</p>\n<p>“I knew this would happened,” Yulong sighed.</p>\n<p>“Then there’s Blackwood Family too…” Grandpa Piss’s sigh followed. “They seems interested in taking away Young Lady Bhela as a bride… I really don’t know what to say…”</p>\n<p>Yulong drank the <em>tuak</em> and told Grandpa Piss his reasoning, “That boy from Blackwood Family still hasn’t accepted Sir Jhuro’s decission to retire sixteen years ago. He’s been keeping quiet because he knew even the royalty and the organization behind him couldn’t protect him from Old Sir Lharu’s and Old Madam Sari’s retrubution. Time’s change. I reckon there’s some change somewhere that make him cocky.”</p>\n<p>“Old Sir and Old Madam too far away to give help in case something like this happens suddenly. Should I help you and Sir Jhuro keeping tabs on Blackwood Family?” Grandpa Piss asked.</p>\n<p>While Jhuro Yashura left behind resources and men outside before he retired, he almost never interacted with the high society of nobility. For ears and eyes to reach those fancy places, it would take time and efforts for current Yulong and Shuro Yashura to do so. It was way better to ask Grandpa Piss who already familiar due to his family’s generations of Alchemist profession. However, Yulong rejected the offer without giving it a real thought.</p>\n<p>“You don’t need to worry. Blackwood Family only taking a ride of that boy’s ambition. If he really supports his foster family right from the start, Blackwood won’t be stuck with their viscount nobility rank.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss wanted to offer any more help, but he long sensed the old butler’s distrust of him on affairs that didn’t include medicines and elixirs. So he kept his mouth shut for the time being.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, a golden owl landed on the veranda where the two old men enjoyed their <em>tuak</em>. The own brought a small piece of paper and inked quill with it.</p>\n<p>“Go, send this message to Sir Jhuro, as fast as possible!” Butler Yulong said to the owl after he wrote his tiny letter. Then he glanced at Grandpa Piss and said, “this is an owl I keep around in case there’s an emergency. Sir Jhuro also brought one with him.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss nodded with a painful smile. This golden owl was long thought to be extinct, but the reality there were small amounts of them were being kept in case of emergencies. They were rare, almost becoming birds of legend. Small to medium sized kingdoms wouldn’t dare to think getting their hands on it, not to mention Grandpa Piss’s own family. But this old butler had one with him. And the prodigial man of Yashura Family casually brought this treasure bird with him to travel around the southern land.</p>\n<p>“This is really for emergency,” Yulong said coldly, knowing full well the old Alchemist’s envy.</p>\n<p>“I know, I know--for emergency.”</p>\n<p>The owl then flew away bringing Yulong’s letter.</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss and Snotty returned back to their own village the next morning. After sending them away, Yulong found out the young master, Shira Yashura, wanted to go to the market to pick some goods for his contracted pedlers to sell. He was worried the young master’s inexperience getting him exploited. Therefore, he waited in the gate and followed the boy from behind.</p>\n<p>In front of an inn owned by Elzhier Family, Yulong saw a familiar eastern Kaya man came out with a respectable, but humble Mossack man behind him. The Kaya man, Sir Kurusiya, noticed Yulong, immediately cupped his fist and bowed his body. That was a salute of great respect eastern Kaya men usually give to people they regard highly. Sir Baront Staterwind didn’t know what was going on, so he imitated his companion to salute Yulong even though he didn’t really know he was only a butler.</p>\n<p>“You know them, Yulong?” Shira asked.</p>\n<p>“The Kaya man once works in the same place as your father, young master.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, that’s why you know him.” Yulong was his mother helper, and his father brought him along to Yashura Family when Shira still in his mother’s belly. Shira never liked to listen about his father’s past, even though it was often glorified since he was completely stopped marauding bandits from approaching Badril Village. Walking toward the market, Shira kept quiet and didn’t ask the matter any further.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Far away from Badril Village, the golden owl Yulong tasked with the emergency letter flew through walls of mist and mountains. It instinctively knew the location of its recipient, Jhuro Yashura, even though Yulong wasn’t necesserarily knew where he was. Not even a half day passed by since the bird took off from Yashura Family, it flew already more than halfway toward its destination.</p>\n<p>Its speed was unprecendeted amongst the magical beast. No wonder commonfolks thought it was the bird of the legend. It was a shame that it failed to detect a single flash on the horizon, resulting it to succumb to a terrible fate.</p>\n<p><em>Flap flap flap!</em></p>\n<p>The owl futilely tried to avoid danger.</p>\n<p>A single flash all it took to capture the dumbfounded owl. A pair of cold talons gripped its short neck and the next thing it knew, the owl panically flapping its wings in search of oxygen, only to be deprived of fresh air even more. The owl couldn’t see the beast, it only saw a dashingly crimson flash before it was captured by the neck. The hostile beast scretched, only after that the owl realized a damned predator eagle already got it. Annoyed by the owl’s desperate struggle, the eagle broke its neck. The handsome crimson-colored eagle then delivered the dead owl to a mysterious masked man, who then passed it to another man--a pale, thin man who only dressed himself as black as the phantom itself.</p>\n<p>“This owl coming out from Yashura Family, Mister Blackwood. The bird brings a letter with it,” the masked man said as he presented the letter to the pale man.</p>\n<p>“Ah, so they figured it out about the poison,” the pale man with Blackwood surname said. Beside him and the masked man, there was a third man who drained the blood of the golden owl, prepared a little feast of its dead body. The man was very peculiar; bald, with veined oversized muscles that looked like it was almost exploded, and the strange tatooes that covered its body. He was a northern barbarian, the kind that never took orders from civilized men no matter they came from the west, south, or the east. Yet, when the Blackwood guy told him top plucking the dead owl, he obidiently put aside the carcass, not daring to show any hints of disatisfaction.</p>\n<p>“Mister, the young lady of Malikh Family turns out to be a four-elemental Unique Class, she’s a real talent with tremendous potential--your sister tries to take her to Blackwood Family and having a setback because there’s some experts happened to visit Malikh Family. Shall we send anymore resources to help her?”</p>\n<p>“What’s her Blackwood Family have to do with me? It’s already good enough I let her to use my name to coerce people and strengthen her influence in commerce world. She’s getting annoying every time she’s using my toys. That Jhuju’s poison I sent to her only a reminder to Ghalim of our old friendship, my sister should be thankful enough if she gets some benefits from it.”</p>\n<p>The masked man knew the pale man was irritated by his sister’s cockiness. So he excused himself and brought the crimson eagle with him, disappearing into the shadow.</p>\n<p>“We’ve rested enough,” the pale man said as he crumbled the small letter he read. The bald barbarian’s head cocked and he await the order. “Prepare the horses,” the man continued, “I’ve got an old friend I should say hi to.”</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-3/chapter-6":"<p>When the news about what happened in Malikh Family’s ngajen ceremony arrived at Blackwood Family, Madam Blackwood was so enraged she broke the tea cup she held onto the floor. Establishing the family’s foot in Badril Village was supposed to be easy, but not only he failed to gain the support of Malikh Family and the villagers, the Young Master of Blackwood Family somehow managed to incite the bedridden patriarch’s supporters to regain their lost foothold against the corrupt Malikh Family’s elders.</p>\n<p>“There’s no point keeping him in that rural village,” Madam Blackwood said. She was a flamboyant, late thirty years old woman whose beauty was so superior that the previous viscount adopt her as a daughter. “Call Frane back to the city, he’s going to spend two months training in capital!”</p>\n<p>The butler who was waiting for her bowed and went away to carry out the task.</p>\n<p>“How’s Lyla’s birthday party going?”</p>\n<p>“Reply to madam, the party has started, the guests who came only from baron nobilities and mid-rank merchants,” a maid replied.</p>\n<p>The madam glanced the timid middle-aged man who sat on the same table as her. She scoffed, saying, “Look how your daughter made a name for herself. Not only the bribe money was wasted away, she coming on trips in the seminars only resulting her made a fool out of herself! Hah, like father, like daughter! Imbecile!”</p>\n<p>Madam Blackwood hurled the new cup that recently poured with hot, scalding tea. She purposely aimed at the table so the hot water splashed on the viscount’s hands. The timid viscount didn’t make a sound when his hands getting burnt, he didn’t dare to fight against his wife. It was already ten years too late for him to retaliate in any way. From the way he dragged his limping leg to fetch damp towel for his scaling skin, it was clear the waiting servants already used to ignore him.</p>\n<p>Recently, his wife’s mood had became the worst ever since their youngest daughter came back from the two years seminars. Unlike Frane--who only registered as his son by blood in papers, Lyla hadn’t show any particular talents in becoming a Class worthy of a noble family. She had a decent progress speed, a Level 7 Novice after seminars, but that progress mainly because she never had the interest to train herself. Madam Blackwood had bribed the officials so Lyla could enter the seminars supposed to boost her standing in high society, so she could catch higher ranking nobles eyes somehow. However, that plan failed in the worst way that could happen to a noble family like the Blackwood. She made blunders and broke rules so many times that she became a laughing stock. The only families that interested in her only lower rank nobles and not-so well off merchant families.</p>\n<p>“There also no point keeping that useless girl forever in the mansion,” Madam Blackwood said. “Send her to Badril Village by tomorrow. Make some smart men tending to her needs--they have to smart enough to know how to reel those Malikh villagers to say yes when I send my words in the future!”</p>\n<p>After the son’s failure, the madam would send her daughter, to do nothing but play around in Malikh Family. Even if there was something the girl could do, the madam surely wouldn’t choose this daughter of hers who she deemed too brainless to do even the simplest tasks. Her daughter was just that useless to her. The one with received the orders were people who accompanied her, who had experience in bribing and coercing. They were tasked to devour Malikh Family from the inside. The Blackwood would surely corner Bhela Malikh this time.</p>\n<p>Somewhere else, in a colorless courtyard, a birthday party already went on for about two hours. Most guests already leaving, not unlike the year before the two-years seminars happened when the sons of noble families dallying around waiting for a chance to talk with the young lady. Today, the Young Lady of Blackwood Family turned fourteen, two years before she would considered mature, but this young miss still pouting her mouth like a little girl.</p>\n<p>The old handmaid saw her young lady was bored and offered a treat.</p>\n<p>“Young lady, try this cake. A certain famous bakery made this just for your birthday.”</p>\n<p>The cake served on a small plate along with a silver fork. The girl took only mere seconds to finish it.</p>\n<p>“Is it good?” the handmaid asked.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t matter if it’s good or not, Aunt Jiji, I still hungry with this tiny minny bit of cake! Let me eat that one!” the girl pointed at the layered cake served on the center of the party.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Lyla, you can’t!”</p>\n<p>“Why can’t I?!”</p>\n<p>“You must present yourself as a proper young lady, so you can’t!”</p>\n<p>The cake was to be portioned to serve for the same amount of guests since the last party, but because the Blackwood Family’s young lady had a bad reputation in the seminars, most invited families didn’t actually come.</p>\n<p>“But I can’t be a lady if I’m hungry, am I?”</p>\n<p>“You must learn the way. Be patient, Young Lady Lyla!”</p>\n<p>“But I am huuungriiiiieeeehhh!!!”</p>\n<p>Aunt Jiji was terrified when she realized the young lady wasn’t referred only to portion of the cake, but she wanted to eat the whole cake. This shorty girl, although her feature was thin with only her cheeks got plump, actually had a talent to be a terrifying glutton that would be seen in Tiramikal Continent every one hundred years. It was a useless talent that brought only shame to Blackwood Family.</p>\n<p>It was fortunate that before the young lady could make a big ruckus, a maidservant came to bring the news about the madam’s decision. Aunt Jiji passed it to the young lady immediately.</p>\n<p>“You heard that, young lady! Madam is going to send you for a vacation!”</p>\n<p>Lyla’s head straightened, she forgot to pout. “Vacation? Where? Where where?”</p>\n<p>“To Badril Village!”</p>\n<p>“Badril Village?” the girl tilted her head. “Where’s that?”</p>\n<p>“If you promise Aunt Jiji not to eat too much cake today, Aunt Jiji will tell you where it is…”</p>\n<p>“I will if it turned out somewhere fun!”</p>\n<p>“Badril Village is where Young Lady Bhela’s home place!”</p>\n<p>“Sis Bhela’s home?!” Lyla gasped, “yahoooo!!!”</p>\n<p>Ignoring that she was the center of attention, Lyla suddenly jumped and danced like no tomorrow. Aunt Jiji tried to stop her, but it was futile since Lyla only promised not to be glutton. The remaining guests began whispering with each other. They were people who doubted the rumors about this Young Lady Blackwood, but after seeing how childish and ridiculous the girl danced, people were finally convinced. How was this a viscount’s daughter supposed to act? The girl danced her hips and hopped around like a bunny that had an itchy bum. Soon, the Young Lady Lyla Blackwood fell to the bottom list of desired young ladies to marry. Her reputation fell from not-so-smart, to stupid, and then fell again to brainless and imbecile. People didn’t see her in a good light. But that just how a girl named Lyla Blackwood really was.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Yashura Family got a peculiar visitor these past two days. He introduced himself as an expert from overseas, and somehow this foreign expert became interested in Shira Yashura. When the story leaked by insiders from Yashura Family, people were scratching their heads, wondering what could an educated man saw from this trash who could only get himself to level 3 Novice. Some people even sneered, saying that whole news was just Yashura Family’s little trick to clear up rumors from their heir’s name.</p>\n<p>“You understand, kiddo? There are three mandatory rules if someone wants to meet privately with me. First rule, it’s a <em>she</em>, not <em>he</em>. Second rule, big boobs. Third rule, in her lower part, there must be big bubbly butts, as big as her boobs. <em>Anything</em> lesser than that you can just send them back to wherever they came from.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit said that as he moved his chess piece, eating one of Shira’s pawns.</p>\n<p>“And remember, my standard is pretty high. Consult with how loadful those girls from Big-Boobed Sect are for more information,” the Nalaq continued.</p>\n<p>“Please don’t talk nonsense. I’m being serious here,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“Ey, I’m not talking nonsense. The girls from Big-Boobed Sect are real deal, okay? They’re huge! If you don’t believe me then you should go to Elzhier Family one of these days, go check out how glorious their boobs are. They always dance or become the maidservants when they’re not on duties.”</p>\n<p>“Ol’ Good-Natured Spirit… I don’t want to hear this imaginary all-woman sect of yours. Elzhier Family is only a normal rural family, they don’t host any sect members within their walls. If they did, the Village Head would boast about it at my uncle’s face every single day.”</p>\n<p>“You just don’t believe it because you never see how great they are--their boobs, I mean. How great those melons inside tight suits are! Just think about it; leather suits and melons--two entirely different things but if they come together they’d jiggling in harmony. This Good-Natured Spirit approved their sense of style.”</p>\n<p>“Forget about it, it’s not important--”</p>\n<p>“Boobs are important, ey!”</p>\n<p>Shira waved his hand as he didn’t want to continue this nonsense. He then moved a piece and finished his turn. He returned the topic back again, “The expert said he came from a first-tier faction called Blue Robe Society. If we can get his faction’s recognition then at least my family can silence all those rumors about me--especially the recent ones, they really are becoming a pain in the ass.”</p>\n<p>“I told you. I don’t talk with guys. No boobs, no good. Period.”</p>\n<p>“You are really becoming a pain in the ass,” Shira complained.</p>\n<p>After Shira said that, Good-Natured Spirit’s knight jumped over a wall of pawns to get on his bishop. Within a single breath Shira immediately moved his rook, creating a chain reaction that exposes the Nalaq’s defence, resulting his king trapped in three different direction.</p>\n<p>“Check mate.”</p>\n<p>“Ey, what the fu--” Good-Natured Spirit rage quit, flipping the chess board. “Hah! I knew it! You brat, you intentionally make me talk about boobs in order to lower my guard, right?! Fuck! That is how it is, isn’t it?!”</p>\n<p>“No, it is not.”</p>\n<p>“You sneaky bastard. You really got me,” Good-Natured Spirit threw his hands up in the air. <br>\n“Man, I surrender, that is some sick psychological tactic you got there.”</p>\n<p>“Now I don’t really know what you’re talking about.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit waved his hands in surrender, then he lit a cigarette. “Anyway, what do you want from me this time? Money again? I prepared some kobe coins enough for you to buy some candy, here, take this.”</p>\n<p>Shira shoved back the coin bag. “Not today. I just want you to meet Sir Baront Staterwind.”</p>\n<p>“No boobs, no good. Ask something else. How about I tell you the secret place where are those Big-Boobed Sect girls take their bath, ‘ey? Seems fair deal to me.”</p>\n<p>“How many times do I have to tell you--”</p>\n<p>“Sssshhh!!” Good-Natured Spirit hushed the boy. He then whispered, “you hear that?”</p>\n<p>Because the Nalaq suddenly became vigilant, Shira instinctively lowered his voice too. “Hear what?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“I heard some rats watching us…” the Nalaq covered his mouth, as if he didn’t want people to read lips what he said next, “some big-boobed rats…”</p>\n<p>“Huh… what?”</p>\n<p>“The girls from Big-Boobed Sect… they’re here…”</p>\n<p>“The heck are you talking about? This hill is Yashura Family’s property--”</p>\n<p>“Sssshhhh! They’ve noticed me noticing them. Wait here, I’mma get you some melons for your reward!”</p>\n<p>After he saying that, Good-Natured Spirit’s figure melting into the thin air.</p>\n<p>Shira Yashura sighed. At times, asking favor to this vulgar Nalaq not only difficult, it also unpredictable he’d only incite troubles if he not careful.</p>\n<p>After his winning streak for more than half a year maybe he became cocky. He forgot the Nalaq wasn’t there to solve his problem whenever he wanted, although the Nalaq sort of ended up like that after a few months he came here. Shira got some thinking, maybe he should stop seeing this Nalaq as his convenient piggy bank for his own good.</p>\n<p>“Really, he always making a mess for me to clean. I wonder if such thoughtless Nalaqs like him are common around here… now, where’s the last piece again?” he sighed for the second time.</p>\n<p>When he was picking up chess pieces that board Good-Natured Spirit flipped earlier, Shira realized there was a missing piece. Turned out it was stuck in the hole between tree roots.</p>\n<p>He plunged his hand to look for the missing chess piece.</p>\n<p>“Ugh… my fingers can’t reach.”</p>\n<p>He tried to squirm his body to fit his hand in.</p>\n<p>“Where is it again?”</p>\n<p>He frowned. He squirmed his body again really hard.</p>\n<p>“Oh, there it--”</p>\n<p><em>BOOOOOMMMMM!!!!</em></p>\n<p>An explosion happened not far away from the place he used to hang out, creating a wave of rolling dust that swept over the hill. Shira got his hand stuck between the tree rots, he could only hugged his head with his free hand and waited for the shockwave to finish. The chess pieces he gathered already nowhere to be found. He cooked up his head, looking left and right, and saw the greeny grasses were covered with dirts and trees were uprooted. The whole hill became a shithole kind of mess.</p>\n<p>Before the boy could swallow what was going on, a chuckle could be heard near him. Before him, Good-Natured Spirit emerged, coiling around the Nalaq’s body were purple-colored living flames that hungrily tried to eat him whole.</p>\n<p>As carefree as he usually was, Good-Natured Spirit said with a grin, “Those Big-Boobed Sect girls sure are feisty. They’re escaping too fast, I can’t get you melons. I managed to get a feeling of their butts, though. Here, there’s some fragrant left behind.”</p>\n<p>Shira stepped back when the Nalaq offered his palm. It was still on fire, the boy didn’t want to get burn along with him. Besides, he didn’t want to get involved with the Nalaq’s deprived hobby.</p>\n<p>“Sure you don’t want it?” Good-Natured Spirit took a last sniff from his palm, followed by a low chuckle of his.</p>\n<p>“Good-Natured Spirit… what’s that fire?”</p>\n<p>“Yeah? Dunno, man. Exorcism flame or something.”</p>\n<p>“Ohh… oh, it’s very nice to know you up until know. Good bye.”</p>\n<p>“Hmm? You want to go somewhere?” Realizing the purple flame was getting annoying, Good-Natured Spirit then patted away the coiling flame from his shoulders like it was nothing.</p>\n<p>Shira shrugged his shoulders. It seemed this bastard Nalaq was too tough for that exorcism flame. Maybe the flame was too ordinary? Whatever, he didn’t care about that anymore. His eyes then swept the ruin around him. He said, “You can’t forget about the meeting for today. But please clean the mess you made yourself.”</p>\n<p>“That’s what you want for the chess reward?”</p>\n<p>Shira nodded.</p>\n<p>“Aye, aye, will do.” Good-Natured Spirit flicked his fingers, and human-sized paper cranes came out of thin air. They were obedient, not clear whether were monsters or just magical devices. The paper cranes used magnet-like magic to carry the messy uprooted trees and boulders, along with sweeping the dirt from the grass. The cleaning up might take a while, since the hill really was a mess. Shira, feeling a little light on the head, facepalming as he returned back to Yashura Family.</p>\n<p>The whole explosion could be heard from all over Badril Village. It wasn’t clear what its cause, but Yashura Family sent guards to prevent people from knowing what really happened. In Yashura Family’s guest hall, Patriarch Shuro Yashura, a few good Yashura Family elders, and the respected visitor, Sir Baront Staterwind, forming a circle as they sat cross-legged, discussing the explosion that had just occurred.</p>\n<p>“Good elders, Sir Patriarch Yashura, I know you must get excited when I said Young Master Shira has some talent in communicating with Nalaqs. However, a Nalaq still a Nalaq. You must not offend a Nalaq whatsoever, or the consequence is dire! Young Master Shira’s life is way more important than getting a qualification to enter my school!” Sir Baront Staterwind warned. His forehead was still wet with sweat, since he hurriedly ran to Yashura Family when he realized the direction of recent explosion.</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, you’re right, Sir Staterwind. Absolutely right! I already sent someone to check on my nephew’s condition, please calm down,” Patriarch Shuro said.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront shook his head. “You don’t really know what I’m trying to say, do you? You should prepare a very good healer or a doctor, Patriarch Shuro, because if it isn’t death, one can easily lose a limb over angering a Nalaq! That happens more often than you think!”</p>\n<p>The elders drew cold breaths in unison when they heard that. Patriarch Shuro, whose face already pale, becoming even whiter than a sheet of paper. If they boy lost a limb, Shira’s chance to succeed him as the next patriarch could be swept away like specks of dust.</p>\n<p>Yulong the Butler arrived. Everyone in the room had been anxiously waiting for him they instinctively stood up when Yulong approached.</p>\n<p>“Yulong, how’s Shira doing?” Patriarch Shuro asked.</p>\n<p>Yulong replied, “Young Master Shira is back, patriarch. But Madam Yashura sent him to the kitchen for a second breakfast.”</p>\n<p>“Breakfast? What’s a breakfast has something to do with that explosion? Can he still walk?”</p>\n<p>“He’s walking fine, Patriarch Yashura.”</p>\n<p>“Then, Yulong, please go fetch my nephew for me, we have something urgent to tell him!”</p>\n<p>After his trained elegant bow, Yulong stepped back and proceeded to do the task given to him.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront Staterwind peered at the butler’s back. He traveled southern lands many times, visiting many villages, yet, he seldom heard a Mossack descent major family employed western-style butler. What made him confused even more that Sir Kurusiya apparently knew the butler and gave his respect to him, which Sir Baront Staterwind didn’t expect that coming from the cold eastern Kaya swordsman.</p>\n<p>“Dear good elder,” Sir Baront Staterwind asked a random elder who sat beside him, “may I know why there’s a butler working here?”</p>\n<p>“Is Sir referring to Yulong? Yulong isn’t actually working for Yashura Family, but Young Master Shira’s mother’s attendant. I can’t tell you the details, so forgive me sir, all I can say is Young Master Shira’s father is exceedingly brave and awesome he managed to woo a respectable lady many years ago.”</p>\n<p>“Ahhh…” Sir Baront nodded. The boy apparently a result of his parent eloping. The Blue Robe Society expert of course knew etiquette to hold himself from digging the story further.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, Yulong came back with Shira followed behind. The boy wore new clothes since his previous one was dirty. When he saw the group of elders and the expert guest looking at him, Shira sighed inside his heart. He knew he had to clean Good-Natured Spirit’s mess once again.</p>\n<p>“Greetings, elders… greetings, uncle patriarch… greetings, Sir Staterwind…”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro impatiently treading forward. “Shira my boy, is it true that you lost your limbs?”</p>\n<p>“I’m unhurt, uncle, see?” Shira waved both of his hands to prove that his limbs still functioned as they should be.</p>\n<p>“Oh! God, thank God! Really! These are really your hands, aren’t they? Not a fake one made with wood?” Patriarch Shuro Yashura grabbed his nephew hands and waved it around like a child playing with flags.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira,” Sir Baront opened his mouth, “I reckon you failed to ask the Nalaq to meet me? If you can’t do it, young master, it best for you not to push him any further. Today, you offend him and he blast the hill behind your Yashura Family as a warning, but what happens if you make the same mistake tomorrow?”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro nodded at his words vigorously. “Sir Baront is right, Shira my boy. A Nalaq is a revered being ancient Mossacks worshiped as their guardian angel. The consequence of making them mad is very dire! You should know better, my boy, you should’ve told your uncle if a Nalaq came to you the first time!”</p>\n<p>Sir Baront and his uncle Patriarch Shuro had good intentions in telling him about how to be respectful to a Nalaq. But the more Shira heard their warning, the more he doubted about Good-Natured Spirit being a “revered” Nalaq like they said. Of course, saying the truth about the explosion’s true cause resulting only Yashura Family losing face in front of Sir Baront Staterwind. Shira had no choice, he had to tread the matter very carefully.</p>\n<p>“<em>Cough, cough</em>… Uncle, Sir Baront, thank you for your concern. Truth is, it wasn’t that the Nalaq being mad that causes the explosion, but there was some… accident… that happened right before.”</p>\n<p>“With what title do you usually call him, Young Master Shira?” Sir Baront asked.</p>\n<p>“As far as I know, he doesn’t have a title. At least he didn’t tell me if he ever had one. He told me to call him ‘Good-Natured Spirit’.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, with that kind of nickname, he must be a very benevolent person when he was alive,” Sir Baront concluded as he rubbed his beard. “So, Young Master Shira, it seems he didn’t really intent to blast into smithereens.”</p>\n<p>Shira nodded. That part was true. Instead, someone else happened to be intending to blast this Nalaq into smithereens.</p>\n<p>“Thank God! Thank God! If he is a good Nalaq, maybe we don’t need to throw the second ngajen ceremony for this month, after all!” Patriarch Shuro Yashura exclaimed. The elders in the guest hall followed his exclaiming by handclapping and joyful cries. Ngajen ceremony only held once a month so the village safe from angry Selaqs, no one ever tried it to protect themselves from intelligent Nalaqs. Since the village was founded, the locals never had a Nalaq dwelling there. So it was natural for the elders to worry about throwing a ceremony they didn’t know working or not. Ngajen ceremony was expensive, after all.</p>\n<p>The more Shira saw how the previous tense hall turned jubilant and full of relieved faces, the more awkward he became. That Nalaq might call himself ‘Good-Natured Spirit’, yet he was anything but good. A low-life spirit who no doubt had been using the invisibility traits of spirits to commit many deprived crimes. He was closer to evil spirit incarnation than a good-natured one. The misunderstanding was too great his face twisted as if he’d just taste a sour lemon.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront Staterwind said, “Still, since he seems reluctant to use his old name, I reckon the Nalaq that approaching you is a low-tier one, Young Master Shira. Low-tier Nalaqs usually spirits that gain consciousness merely by luck. They don’t have factions backing them, and fortunately--in my experience--it easier to initiate negotiation with unaffiliated Nalaqs.” A hint of pride then flashed through his eyes, he continued, “my disciples will arrive tomorrow morning. One of them contracted with a high-tier Nalaq. Since the Nalaq’s mood turned sour is partly my fault, with help from the Nalaq contracted with one of my disciples, I will ask him to leave Yashura Family peacefully!”</p>\n<p>“Sir Staterwind is wise! Thank you for your concern, Sir!” Patriarch Shuro sang praises toward this expert. The elders of Yashura Family followed suit.</p>\n<p>“As expected of such expert!”</p>\n<p>“Sir Staterwind is the best of bunch of all experts that I know all my life!”</p>\n<p>“Hurray for Sir Staterwind!”</p>\n<p>They circling Sir Baront Staterwind and, not long after that, someone started to prostate. They behaved as if the guest was their one and only savior. Even Shira was getting embarrassed from seeing the scene, not to mention the already flushing Baront Staterwind.</p>\n<p>When everyone getting carried away, Shira slipped out after excusing himself. He knew he was no match for the Yashura Family’s older generations’ shamelessness. Upon walking outside, he saw Yulong was standing by the hall’s door looking galant as usual with his butler professionalism.</p>\n<p>“Can you please try to stop my uncle, Yulong? Sir Staterwind is started to get uncomfortable there.”</p>\n<p>Yulong glanced at the whole mess inside, and then he said to his young master, “I think it’s not everyday an expert coming to Yashura Family, young master, so let’s count this as Patriarch Yashura to gaining favors from a foreign expert.”</p>\n<p>“Are they really okay, though?”</p>\n<p>Yulong smiled.</p>\n<p>“Of course they aren’t, young master. But Patriarch Shuro and the family elders are honest people. Although sometimes they can be overwhelming, I’m sure Sir Staterwind can see no falsehood in their words.”</p>\n<p>Shira looked at those elders inside once again. The more he saw, the more he realized that those hysterical village men calling a man they barely knew these past two days a savior by no means a lie from their part. The elders really were freaking out when they heard the explosion. And Patriarch Shuro Yashura was the most worried of the bunch, considering him a patriarch and an uncle. Thinking about it all again, Shira couldn’t really say he still embarrassed seeing the elders spewing exaggerated flattering with straight faces.</p>\n<p>“Sir Staterwind comes from a respectable sect. Someone like that won’t get to travel the southern lands if he didn’t know the nature of the local people. So it best not to worry about it too much, young master,” Yulong said.</p>\n<p>“Really… ah, speaking of sects,” Shira deliberately changed the topic, “I heard from someone that one of the major families in Badril Village hosts members of a certain sect in secret. You’re from outside, Yulong--do you think something so outrageous like that could happen?”</p>\n<p>“Some older sects have long reaching influence, but I don’t think anyone would be interested to plant their own in Badril Village. There’s nothing valuable here for them to take notice.”</p>\n<p>“As I thought. It’s just unthinkable to think some secret powers lurking beneath our everyday lives. What if some experts actually pretending to be servants here in Yashura Family?”</p>\n<p>Although it wasn’t noticeable, Yulong’s smile became stiff.</p>\n<p>“You jest, young master. If that was true, do you think your uncle and the elders can take that kind of truth?”</p>\n<p>Following Yulong’s gaze, Shira peeped the hall and saw Sir Baront’s awkward figure, where he was in the center of Yashura Family elites--all of them-- who passionately prostrating in the floor. They practically worshipping him now.</p>\n<p>“You’re right…” Shira could only hide his face with his palm. Just when he thought he could understand them, the boy then wished he didn’t know these shameless men.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>As far as the current generation of Badril Village locals knew, they never got visited by nobles until this month Malikh Family’s ngajen ceremony happened. Everyone still talking about it.</p>\n<p>Young Master of Blackwood Family only stayed in Badril Village in one day. And the noble carriage of Blackwood Family set off out of Badril Village by noon. The next morning after the day he was gone, the two foreign guests who had been staying in Malikh Family, Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia, felt overstaying might be unnecessary, thus decided to leave too.</p>\n<p>Because the carriages going out from Badril Village mostly for public transports, Bhela personally asked an elder from his father’s faction who had a horse carriage to give her guests a ride to the nearest town, where they’d later book a private carriage for them to return home. Mister Harrington, as an unsocial bachelor as he always was, was waiting in the carriage for Madame Sylvia to say her parting words to Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>“You have a very bright future, Young Lady Bhela. A girl with limitless potential. So your favor will become very valuable as you mature,” Madame Sylvia said. “If you need something, you can always send letters to my sect. Don’t hold back. Just think about this of us making an investment.”</p>\n<p>Since Bhela a smart girl anyway, Madame Sylvia decided not to make her words fancy and told her in a straightforward manner. Bhela appreciated her honesty, and said her thanks.</p>\n<p>The carriage then set off. In the main gate of Badril Village, the guards on duty witnessed the recently blazing popular Young Lady Bhela Malikh bowing her body as she sent off two foreigners in traveling clothes made from expensive linen.</p>\n<p>“Look at how she is,” inside the carriage, Madame Sylvia said to Mister Harrington. “She’s a pretty sensible girl, don’t you think?”</p>\n<p>“She is,” Mister Harrington said softly, almost a murmur.</p>\n<p>It was hard to start a conversation whenever Mister Harrington sat with his arms crossed tightly. Madame Sylvia could see that he wasn’t exactly happy with the outcome regarding Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>There was no bandits lurking around, and no monsters occasionally came out, proved that the lands around Badril Village actually well-protected--too well, perhaps, for a rural village without a major power backing them. Their journey was smooth without disturbance. Thirty minutes after they left Badril Village, they encountered another carriage painted with black-jet color. The black carriage was well-decorated with golden-colored plates, obviously elites or nobles were traveling inside.</p>\n<p>However, unlike common nobles who liked to hide in the carriage to show-off their elegance and aloofness, this carriage simply out of commonsense. To talk about how weird this carriage was there was a need to point out the refreshing greenness of the view around. Despite there being a road far away from settlement, hint of liveliness from bird chirping--along with croaking frogs from nearby streams and singing insects--completed the idyllic road with a strange harmony that invited light-hearted person to sing along with lively nature. That was exactly what the noble in the black carriage doing. A young lady with a very girly and childish feature was carefreely sitting in the window in spite of pale servants begging her to sit still. She completely dumb about the servants’ pleas. And with her personality, nobody knew whether she was pretending or not. The only thing that the jubilant Lyla Blackwood cared about was singing an off-tune song about her befriending village frogs and bunnies.</p>\n<p>“Prepare your life you frogs and bunnies~</p>\n<p>Cause I’m not letting you go before we become the best of buddies~~</p>\n<p>Wait for me you birdies and kitties~~</p>\n<p>Cause we’re about to become the best of all buddies~~ yuhuu~ yuhuu~~</p>\n<p>The best buddies in this lifetime~~ yuhuuuu~~~”</p>\n<p>There was nothing the servants and the guards could do to stop their young lady from singing this amazingly ugly song about her future exploits in Badril Village. Seeing that another carriage approaching, the horse-riding guards did their best to block the view to the crest planted on the carriage’s compartment. Their effort to save faces from the young lady’s mishap was futile, however, since the other party happened to know Lyla.</p>\n<p>“How many times have I told you to stay away from windows, Lyla!”</p>\n<p>“Whu--what? Who?” Lyla was surprised. But then she was elated to see a familiar face. “Is that you, Instructor Sylvia? You here to train Sis Bhela’s archery again?”</p>\n<p>“Get down from the window!” Madame Sylvia raised her voice.</p>\n<p>“I’m also here to meet Sis Bhela!” Lyla also raised her voice cheerfully.</p>\n<p>“Lyla, you won’t be able to get married in the future if you’re always act like this!” Madame Sylvia warned her. She long dropped title of Young Lady Blackwood when talking to this naughty girl.</p>\n<p>“Um!” Lyla nodded. “But which one do you like more, Instructor Sylvia, bunnies or kitties?” It was no use trying to talk sense to Lyla. Any warning only come to her right ear and gone out straight from the left one.</p>\n<p>“Stay away from the windows!!!” Madame Sylvia screamed until her voice shrilled.</p>\n<p>Lyla also screamed, “Good morning to you too!!!”</p>\n<p>Both carriages drifted apart after the brief encounter. It ended with Lyla happily waved her hands happily. Madame Sylvia sighed and shook her head. That girl was so naughty that the troubles she created made the seminars’ managements even considered to drop her once during the seminars. Only after Bhela Malikh convinced them she’d take care of Lyla they finally did let go the matter.</p>\n<p>Before, the black carriage of Blackwood Family came to Badril Village in the shroud of night’s darkness, so nobody noticed their elegance and the aura of expensive carriage blazing through the village road--of which was surprisingly wide for a settlement road, unlike road of cities in the western kingdoms, because long ago Mossack people needed to endure monster stampedes passing through their villages once every few months.</p>\n<p>“Mom, look, is that a noble?” a snotty kid pointing out the carriage.</p>\n<p>The mother hurriedly pulled her child. “Ssuuussh! Keep your finger to yourself! Don’t you know what happened to peasants that make noble angry from the stories they always talking about?”</p>\n<p>The steel-armored guards who escort the carriage scoffed them in disdain. Contrast with the escorts’ attitudes, Lyla waved her hand at them, while shouting, “Hey boy, don’t you think bunnies are cute as the kitties? Or do you like cats more?”</p>\n<p>The kid didn’t answer. He instead forced to bow by her mother and let the carriage went through silently. The villagers didn’t have the experience in receiving nobles, most of them--except for those who attended the ngajen ceremony in Malikh Family--had never saw nobles in their lives. Because of that they were awkward and didn’t know what to do.</p>\n<p>Lyla didn’t seem to mind their stiffness. Instead, she vigorously greeted everyone she saw from the window she sat on.</p>\n<p>“Good day! Good morning! I’m here to sleepover at Sis Bhela’s place! Do you know where Sis Bhela lives?”</p>\n<p>Back in Elzhier Family, in the main family’s house, their patriarch, hurriedly changed his clothes to a formal one he always used every ngajen ceremony.</p>\n<p>“Hurry, hurry! As the head of this village, how can I let a noble arriving without me receiving them?!”</p>\n<p>Not even he yet buttoned his shirt properly, the Village Head sprinted toward the main street, only to see the crowd of onlookers already dispersed and still talking about the scary nobles they always heard in stories were actually <em>weirdly</em> friendly.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Bhela Malikh was already notified about Lyla Blackwood’s arrival. She waited on a chair at the Malikh Family’s gate, drinking a fresh young coconut water occasionally. The black carriage finally was in her view. And the young girl she was waiting for happily waved her hand at her. From the window.</p>\n<p>“Carefull, Lyla!” Bhela yelled as she sprang from her chair.</p>\n<p>“Huuupp!” Lyla Blackwood simply didn’t want to waste anytime leaving the carriage through the door. So she simply jumped from the window she sat upon, before the carriage even stopped. It was fortunate that amongst Bhela’s skill as a Unique Class, she had <b>Haste</b>, which boosted her speed in short duration. She used that to catch Lyla before she hurt herself. The young noble girl landed splendidly in Bhela’s arm.</p>\n<p>“What’s this, Sistah?” Lyla’s eyes sparkled when she saw Bhela get a young coconut in her other hand. She was completely oblivious she just did something dangerous.</p>\n<p>“Young coconut. There’s still some of its water left. Here, try this,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“For me? Really?”</p>\n<p>“Drink slowly…”</p>\n<p><em>Glug glug glug</em>. Lyla drank the coconut in anything but in slowly manner. She even burped shamelessly.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Lyla, ah!” the butler who coming with her was in horror seeing how Young Lady Lyla Blackwood made a horrible mess by spilling the coconut water on her expensive, silk woven black dress. Only an equally expensive silk handkerchief worthy enough to wipe his young lady’s noble dress!</p>\n<p>“I told you to drink slowly…” Bhela said. She used her sleeve to wipe Lyla’s wet face, and then proceeded to also wipe Lyla’s dress.</p>\n<p>“Y-young miss!” the butler shouted in panic. His body jolted as soon as he saw the outrageous act of spoiling the young noble’s dress by making it contacted with commoner clothes. That was heresy! He needed her to stop before she contained Blackwood’s expensive dress with her commoner’s bacteria!</p>\n<p>“You need something?” Bhela looked at this unfamiliar butler of Blackwood Family. Her expressionless face judged the butler coldly.</p>\n<p>“My name is Tim, young miss--please use this!” the butler offered a silky smooth handkerchief with Blackwood Family’s crest embroidered on the surface. The handkerchief was actually the butler’s, was awarded to his great-great-great grandfather by the then Baron Blackwood for some sort of achievement that practically nobody was still alive to remember. Everytime Butler Tim met a new person, he’d make an excuse to show off this particular handkerchief. Today was no exception. It was his most precious handkerchief. Just from the look of it one could tell how crazy expensive it was.</p>\n<p>“Ah, ah… my nose… aahhh--” Lyla felt her nose was wet and itchy, “--ahhtchii!!!”</p>\n<p>“You’ve got a flu?” Bhela asked worriedly.</p>\n<p>“Yeah. Aunt Jiji told me to drink my medicine everyday but it’s so bitter. So much bitter that it’s evil!”</p>\n<p>“Where’s your medicine now?”</p>\n<p>“Oh. I throw it away last night.”</p>\n<p>Bhela shook her head.</p>\n<p>“That’s no good. You can’t throw away your medicine like that. Now, wipe your nose. This mister butler said to use this…” she put the handkerchief on Lyla’s nose, and Lyla blew her nose on it.</p>\n<p>Lyla gave back the handkerchief to Butler Tim. “Thank you, Sir Butler. It’s very helpful of you.”</p>\n<p>The butler received back his most precious handkerchief. Bonus Lyla’s snot.</p>\n<p>“Come on inside,” Bhela said to Lyla. “Even if the water runs dry, coconuts still have meat we can scoop. After that we’ll pick some star fruits that I planted since I was a child.”</p>\n<p>“Star fruits! Woohooo!”</p>\n<p>The girls then walked inside. Lyla was so excited she didn’t leave her friend, hanging on her neck like a koala being comfortable on a tree branch. The stories about a noble young lady coming to Malikh Family for Bhela Malikh spread amongst the maidservants like oil being poured on an open wildfire. The Malikhs couldn’t describe the pride seeing their eldest young lady with a blue blood friend. Especially the aunties. They watched how close Bhela and Lyla with teary eyes and happy smiles.</p>\n<p>“Young lady is… finally… finally…”</p>\n<p>“She finally has a friend…”</p>\n<p>“Huuu… huuu… merciful Goddesses finally saw the young lady’s plight and blessed her with a real friend… huuu huuuu….”</p>\n<p>Nobody more happier than the aunties who were familiar with how their Young Lady Bhela lived her live. They silently cried watching their young lady, who usually alone and unapproachable, finally grown up and had her first friend in these past ten years.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Butler Tim grimaced inside. Despite the fact that he was tasked to win over Bhela Malikh with any means necessary, he didn’t like this girl. It wasn’t because his handkerchief got dirty--well, maybe he resented her for it a little--it because the girl named Bhela Malikh wasn’t acting as a young country girl supposed to act. Country bumpkins supposed to falter when they saw the radiance seeped out of the nobles’ aura, they supposed to tremble when they saw the noble wealth glittering beneath the sun. But this girl was indifferent and aloof. She was cold but the coldness paired with concise and elegant mannerism. Butler Tim knew she trying to act noble herself. That was why he didn’t like her.</p>\n<p>However, Butler Tim was a smart person. Any smart person would wear a perfect smile despite his heart bleeding over the snot on his precious handkerchief. Before leaving the city, the butler didn’t forget to look for a gift he’d use to lower the Malikh Family’s guard. He heard the previous gift was rejected, and when he asked for the content of the gift, the smart Butler Tim shook his head as if he knew it would happen.</p>\n<p>Toward country bumpkins, too expensive gifts would never work. He knew this because he was smart. And because he was smart, he knew better gifts. Not-so-expensive gifts worked for country bumpkins.</p>\n<p>Therefore, he presented Bhela Malikh with popular city biscuits.</p>\n<p>“I heard this biscuit is currently very popular among noble young ladies. This butler happened to pass by a store that sold this, so I reckon Young Lady Bhela might love to taste some.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, because the elders roughly knew the Blackwood Family’s youngest lady would come to visit, two leaders of opposing factions came to watch how their Young Lady Bhela would receive the noble guest. Elder Jhamil was all smiling because he liked what he saw. But the expression of Elder Khasim turned sour when he saw how the butler of Blackwood Family tried to butter up to Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>“Don’t accept it, young lady, please….” Elder Khasim whispered under his breath. Of course, there was no single soul heard what he just said. He was worried the hard work to rebuild his faction’s morale all would turn into dust if people thought their spiritual mascot, the one and only Young Lady Bhela Malikh, could be bought with mere biscuits.</p>\n<p>Contrary to what Elder Khasim hoped, Bhela Malikh received the gift without even putting a second thought. A feeling of defeat surged inside him. Elder Jhamil looked at his rival with a mocking glance.</p>\n<p>After receiving the snacks, Bhela excused herself and brought Lyla with her to stroll around Malikh Family’s gardens. Butler Tim pretended to wave his hand and smiled, but inside, he was gloating at how hypocrite Bhela was. His guess that Young Lady Bhela wouldn’t refuse the gift he brought was entirely correct. Before, he deliberately said the biscuit was noble young ladies’ favorite. Thus, according to his smart logic, as long as it wasn’t too expensive that it’d scare this fake young lady, no way a noble wannabe would reject this kind of gifts.</p>\n<p>“Heh,” Butler Tim scoffed when Bhela and Lyla already left. “Bet you’ve never eaten any city biscuits your entire life, haven’t you.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, Bhela Malikh hadn’t had any city biscuits her entire life. Not before and also not today. What Butler Tim didn’t know was that the snacks he bought with his own money ultimately ended up returned to Blackwood Family--to be exact, it ended up inside Lyla Blackwood’s belly. Bhela couldn’t help but received the biscuits when, beside her, she saw Lyla was drooling looking at the biscuits.</p>\n<p>The elders led by Elder Jhamil then respectfully welcomed the butler along with servants and guards from Blackwood Family. From the impression alone, Butler Tim could see reasons for him to like this slick-tongued Elder Jhamil. He knew how to flatter and also he knew how to act humble in front of people with higher status than him. Not like that noble-wannabe Young Lady of Malikh Family. This Elder Jhamil knew that he was only a country bumpkin thus acted accordingly. Naturally, the smart Butler Tim was pleased.</p>\n<p>And so began Butler Tim’s quests to swallow Malikh Family with his smartly planned schemes and cunning political games.</p>\n<p>In mere hours, the neutral elders who hadn’t joined either both rivalling factions began flocking to Elder Jhamil’s side. One part because they wanted to side with the faction that had the noble support and another part simply because Elder Jhamil, with the help of Butler Tim, had been throwing around sweet deals over all directions.</p>\n<p>“Only one tenth of the elder council members don’t want to pick a side by now, but their number is too significant to be an obstacle for Sir Butler’s great plan,” Elder Jhamil reported the current situation to Butler Tim.</p>\n<p>The butler was enjoying a glass of tea served by the maid that supposed to serve Young Lady Lyla Blackwood as if he was the visiting noble himself. He nodded. “I see. With this, the first stage of my plan has been completed.”</p>\n<p>“Oohhh!” Elder Jhamil exclaimed. “Sir Butler summoned rain and fire by flipping Malikh Family’s political scene upside down, and this is only the first stage?! As expected, the Butler of Blackwood Family is very smart!”</p>\n<p>Butler Tim originally wanted to act aloof and sophisticated before he visited this rural village. However, upon being called a smart person, he couldn’t help but grinned widely. “Oho, you’re an interesting fella, aren’t you? Very well, since you’ve done a good job yourself, I won’t be so petty to grab all the credit. Tell me how I should do next, if I like what I hear, we might as well corporate your thoughts into my plan.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was excited. How could he not? An opportunity to rise beyond a mere elder of rural village was laid before him.</p>\n<p>“Sir Butler, you may not know this, but we Mossack people regard having a good meal very highly. Everytime we’re having breakfast or dinner together as the entire family, even though we’re always looked peaceful outside, those trivial events actually are a political battlefield for us elders to extend our influence! This lowly man himself used a few move in the past during breakfast to gather like-minded men under my banner. I used all my resources and connections in a single mealtime to attack my rivals! However, these past two days, my biggest rival used a lowly method against me…”</p>\n<p>“Oh? What did he do?” Butler Tim asked.</p>\n<p>“He didn’t do much,” Elder Jhamil said, sneering when he was talking about this rival of his, “all he did was inviting Young Lady Bhela everytime we were having a meal in the family hall. He’s been a stubborn and ignorant supporter of main family, but this time he actually knew how to use his connection with the main family to deal a blow against me. A few of the elders had been faltering when they saw Young Lady Bhela leaning over the other side; I’m afraid if we’re leaving this ignorant rival of me doing as he wanted, there’s gonna be a hole in Sir Butler’s smart plan!”</p>\n<p>Butler Tim swirled the tea in his cup as though he was deep in thought. Of course, if this proven to endanger his smart plan, the butler couldn’t sit still watching all that happened. “I heard the Mossacks are peculiar people, but I don’t know you Mossack people have a strange custom!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, we’re living here far away from the city, so of course our traditions might seem unsophisticated to wise westerners like Sir Butler,” Elder Jhamil fawned.</p>\n<p>“Then what do you suggest Blackwood Family should do in this situation, Elder Jhamil?”</p>\n<p>“It’s easy!” Elder Jhamil was so excited he almost jumped from his seat. “My rival faction used Young Lady Bhela to gain foothold, and we can also use that to deal a greater blow back to them!”</p>\n<p>“And that is?”</p>\n<p>“Of course, we can use--I mean, we can invite young noble miss to a dinner together with us. With this we can unofficially announce our alliance with Blackwood Family! It’s the final nail to main family’s faction!”</p>\n<p>Even though Bhela Malikh’s status as a Unique Class shone throughout all of Badril Village, her name still fall short with a pure noble like Lyla Blackwood. Madam back in Blackwood Family used her daughter so Blackwood could infiltrate Malikh Family easily, but that didn’t mean Lyla still wasn’t as useful.</p>\n<p>“Very well. Let us go with that,” then he asked the maid responsible for Lyla’s schedule. “What was Young Lady Lyla doing this afternoon?”</p>\n<p>The maid replied, “Young Lady Bhela Malikh carried her around to play. At first, they went to Malikh Family’s orchard to pick some fruits. Then they visited the sick Patriarch Malikh in his room for a few minutes. After that, they went outside to stroll and came back with a new rabbit pet they bought from other family. Finally, when the sun is setting, they went to the kitchen to watch the servants cooking.”</p>\n<p>“How uncouth for a noble young lady being led around in dirty places like that,” Butler Tim was displeased, but nothing he could do since making Bhela’s attention elsewhere meant he could move freely to make a trap for her. Nodding to himself, the butler then gave an instruction to the maid, “you go to Young Lady Lyla and tell that Malikh Family invite her for a dinner.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was excitedly rubbing his hands when Butler Tim said that. Finally, payback to those imbecile Elder Khasim!</p>\n<p>“But, Butler Tim…” the maid hesitated.</p>\n<p>“What is it?”</p>\n<p>“Malikh Family already invited Young Lady Lyla to have dinner. She’s eating in Malikh Family’s hall right now….”</p>\n<p>“Hmm, what do you mean?”</p>\n<p>What the maid meant was that someone in Malikh Family already brought Lyla to have dinner with them.</p>\n<p>When Butler Tim playing political games and scheming around in Malikh Family, Bhela Malikh, along with the elders friendly with Elder Khasim, had been giving bunch of candies and food for Lyla Blackwood, much more than the biscuits Butler Tim brought with him. Being a great foodie herself, Lyla never had enough, the first day in Malikh Family she ate more sweets and foods worth of one week back in Blackwood Family’s manor. Aunt Jiji and other Blackwood Family’s maid servants would freak out if they saw how glutton Lyla currently was.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the news that the main family’s faction hosting a dinner for a noble miss swept Malikh Family like a thunderstorm. The neutral elders Elder Jhamil had just bought flocking back toward Elder Khasim’s side. It was so sudden. Everyone wasn’t even got a breath to process what had happened. And this for sure was an unprecedented move ever since Patriarch Ghalim suddenly fell ill and retreated from the political scene.</p>\n<p>Just as one side was busy completing the first stage to win over the Young Lady of Malikh Family, the other side already won over Young Lady of the noble Blackwood Family. All happened in a span of a single day.</p>\n<p>“Y-young Lady Lyla…”</p>\n<p>Even Butler Tim couldn’t pull his own young miss seeing how happy she was. His plan had been jabbed in a completely unexpected way. Maybe he wasn’t so smart after all.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>It was unfortunate that Madam Malikh didn’t see the Young Noble Miss of Blackwood Family kindly. Even though the girl did nothing wrong, Madam Malikh wasn’t so muddled that she wasn’t aware what Blackwood Family and those corrupt elders conspiring against her husband and Malikh’s main family. Even Bhela herself couldn’t do anything to change her mother’s mind.</p>\n<p>However, Lyla Blackwood, an airhead as she always was, was oblivious of the hostility directed toward her.</p>\n<p>It was morning the second day Lyla in Badril Village. Following her friend Bhela, she carried a little box inside Patriarch Ghalim’s bedroom. This little box filled with custom-made medicines--most were amateurly mixed from two different trivial medicines, consisted of remedies for flu and headache. Nothing harmful but nothing useful at the same time. And just like yesterday, to pay for Bhela parents’ kindness for letting her staying in Malikh Family, Lyla Blackwood decided to play doctor a little bit.</p>\n<p>“Uncle, I’m coming again to help you feel better,” Lyla said as she dragged a chair and sat beside Patriarch Ghalim’s sick bed. Seeing the pale middle-aged man in bed, she blinked her googly eyes, then continued, “how’s yesterday medicine I gave you. Are you feeling a tiny minny bit better, perhaps?”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim certainly was feeling better these past few days, not because Lyla’s medicines, but Grandpa Piss’s diagnosis and remedies. Toward this girl, he weakly nodded. “Thank you for your help, little lady.”</p>\n<p>“Then I’m going to fed you my newest recipe, uncle. Here, here, open your mouth.”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghamil did what he was told. Because Lyla didn’t like bitter medicine, she added lots of brown sugar. Lots and lots of brown sugar.</p>\n<p>“It’s… sweet.”</p>\n<p>“Are you feeling better, now?” Lyla asked.</p>\n<p>“Yes, little lady, I’m feeling better.”</p>\n<p>As a matter of fact, he wasn’t. The medicine was more like a candy than remedy.</p>\n<p>“Good! If you eat this three times a day, maybe your illness would go away, uncle,” Lyla then sternly pointed out, “maybe!”</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh was nervous when her husband consumed the strange medicine Lyla gave him, but she didn’t open her mouth to protest. Bhela was changing the pillows’ sheet nearby, and doing some other chores that usually were done by the servants. In the meantime, Lyla was giving advice for Patriarch Ghalim liked how he should eat moderately three times a day, how he should brush his teeth after he ate sweets, and all the things Aunt Jiji told Lyla all the time.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to visit again, uncle, get well soon!” Lyla waved her hands. Carrying a broom in her hands, Lyla’s next schedule was following Bhela doing chores in the courtyard.</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim weakly waved his hand back. Of course, after the girls were already gone, he noticed his bitter wife biting her lips indignantly.</p>\n<p>“Don’t stare the girl so much. She’s not responsible for her family’s wrongdoings. It’s not like a girl her age knows what her parents do behind the scene.”</p>\n<p>“Why did you eat that? What if they used her to give you more poison?”</p>\n<p>“Bhela wouldn’t let me have the medicine if she didn’t what it was, no? Stop putting that kind of face, you only make our daughter feels awkward about all this.”</p>\n<p>The woman held her husband’s hand, kissing it with her forehead as she hid her face. She whispered, “Oh, don’t you know how hurt this heart holding back my grievance? Why did our daughter had to bring someone from that family inside our roof?” she sniffed, “how long this farce gonna last? What should I do in the mean time? Oh! I don’t know! I don’t know!”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim sighed as he witnessed his wife cried helplessly.</p>\n<p>In the courtyard, near the coops where Malikh Family raised chickens and ducks, Lyla was squatting in front of the new bunny she and Bhela bought just yesterday. She was waiting the whole morning just to feed this bunny. The bunny hopped around, itching to play in spite it couldn’t resist the temptation of delicious green leaves, again and again. Wathing how glutton the bunny was, Lyla found herself immerse in immense joy. She very much envying the life of a bunny. Perhaps that because she could relate to how it spent its day without worry; eating, playing, sleeping, then playing again--a life that she longed to have. If only she was born a rabbit instead of a young lady of noble family….</p>\n<p>The sound of the broom swept the ground took away her attention. Lyla couldn’t understand how a daughter of a patriarch like Bhela had to work so much.</p>\n<p>“Why do you work so much, Sistah?” Lyla asked when she found out there still much dry leaves Bhela had to sweep. “Won’t you get bored soon? Just let the servants clean this place.”</p>\n<p>Bhela, sweeping as if Lyla’s idleness didn’t bother her the slightest, replied, “Here in Badril Village, everyone who hasn’t done their coming of age ceremony has to do chores for their parents. It doesn’t matter if it’s the farmer’s daughter or the biggest family’s young lady, helping the matter of the household is one of the seven virtues we Mossack people get to do for our parents.”</p>\n<p>Originally, Lyla wanted her friend also playing with the bunny. But hearing Bhela just said something serious, there was no way she’d reveal her intention now. “My mom always nagging me to go to dance lesson or whatever. It’s very very boring,” she murmured, a bit dejected.</p>\n<p>“The west and the south have different values,” Bhela said. “Complete your virtue for your parents then you’ll grow to be a fine lady, Lyla.”</p>\n<p>“Uggghhh…” Lyla grunted as she didn’t want to continue the topic any further. She long developed a sense for her own survival to detect whether or not the conversation ended up she being forced to do some boring stuff. Knowing Bhela’s personality, Lyla knew soon Sis Bhela’d make her doing chores too. Grabbing the bunny, Lyla quickly escaped somewhere else so that she could spend her time playing. Bhela shook her head seeing the girl’s behavior.</p>\n<p>Bhela then noticed some servants whispering while they looking at Lyla from the distance. Many people were curious what a noble young lady like her would do in a rural place like this, and Bhela wasn’t that oblivious not to notice the eyes planted by the elders of Malikh Family.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, she then saw four girls dressed in expensive garments approaching Lyla with their mouth covered with feathered fans in their hands. Their clothing looked as if they attending some sort of ceremony, while in fact, they calculated that this kind of appearance was the most suitable for them to socialize with a girl of blue-blooded origin. Bhela recognized the leader of those girls was actually Elder Jhamil’s niece.</p>\n<p>“Have you read Le Armour dan Varoza written by Leornador De Gonzalez, Young Lady Blackwood?”</p>\n<p>“Ah, yes, that piece was adequately sophisticated but I think Vista van Gracious’s omnibus more than adequate, le banjour?”</p>\n<p>“I see, I see, their pieces adequately well-written as those senor themselves adequattely live as maestro. But perhaps equoliette more than fit the diagram as paradigm sensorita abligioate senor des adequately le banjour.”</p>\n<p>“But of course, Young Lady Blackwood is more addequately sophisitacted as it’s a noblesse obligiote to be more sohpisitacated than us village senioritas. Perhaps le banjour is fortuna with de gracious by Young Lady’s great wisdom?”</p>\n<p>Lyla blinked her eyes trying to decipher whatever these girls mean. The bunny in her arms even escaped amidst her confusion.</p>\n<p>“Uhh… uhhh…” Lyla timidly stepped back from the feathered fan girls. “I think Sis Bhela is calling me…”</p>\n<p>She swiftly ran away back to her friend Bhela.</p>\n<p>“Sistah, Sistah Bhela!” Lyla cried and grabbing Bhela’s sloven sleeve tightly, demanding for justice, “they came to bully me!”</p>\n<p>“What did they do?” Bhela asked.</p>\n<p>“They know I can’t speak western language! They came to test me! They’re even worse than those rich girls in seminar--they jumble some western mumbo jumbo into plain language in order to confuse me! They must be laughing and call me stupid by now!”</p>\n<p>Hearing Lyla’s grievance, Bhela patted her head in order to let the girl calmed down.</p>\n<p>“Lyla, those girls are different than the noble girls that always making fun of you.”</p>\n<p>“Different? How so?”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at the girls who also was watching them back while fanning themselves with their fabulous feathered fans.</p>\n<p>“They looked like noble descendants, but actually were not.”</p>\n<p>“I still don’t like them nonetheless!”</p>\n<p>“You don’t have to talk to them if you don’t want to,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>Yet Lyla still restlessly tugging Bhela’s sleeves, making it harder for her to do her chores. Before the peers that always making fun of her, Lyla was always helpless and had been depending on Bhela’s figure as a shield. What it looked like from the point of view of an outsider was a scene where a young mother being tested of her patience dealing with a girl who was throwing a tantrum.</p>\n<p>Seeing that the young noble miss wouldn’t come back soon, the feathered fan girls approaching Bhela and Lyla instead.</p>\n<p>“Oh, fancy to meet Young Lady Bhela here, le banjour!”</p>\n<p>“Le bonjour…” Bhela hesitated to reply back. Tilting her head slightly, she studied the pompously dressed girls before her. These girls were relatives of Malikh Family’s elders. None of them could match with Bhela if talking strictly about social status wise, not to mention talents. However, while she was holding her broom, it looked like Bhela was the one with common origin, while these girls were floating swans who happened to be generous enough to greet plebeians with their <em>unique</em> vocabulary.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Lyla Blackwood hid behind Lyla’s back. Despite a noble origin herself, meeting more cocky and fake young ladies than the girls before her were rare experience for Lyla.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela, fancy to meet you. Good morning. The weather is nice. I eat snails everyday,” Elder Jhamil’s niece took the lead and said that with a hint of inflated pride.</p>\n<p>Bhela narrowed her eyes. She could see why Lyla instantly hated these girls. She then said in a sleek foreign language, “Je ne sais pas de quoi tu parles. Si vous ne parlez pas une langue étrangère, fermez simplement la bouche, sinon vous faites peur aux enfants avec votre non-sens.”</p>\n<p>The feathered fan girls blinked their eyes trying to decipher whatever Bhela had said.</p>\n<p>“Oh, it turns out Young Lady Bhela is aquadettely know some le banjour!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, Young Lady Bhela is adequately sophisticated after all. Me gusta!”</p>\n<p>“I see, I see, le pasta fortuna is delicosaza.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s niece didn’t say anything as she only maintained a sweet smile while being nervous herself. Racking her brains over remembering the contents of thick dictionary, she tried to form a decent sentences in foreign language. But Bhela then cut off her train of thought before she could say a word.</p>\n<p>“Blackwood Family is migrating noble that has long been making their roots here in southern land. Hundred of years living far away from their western peers, noble families like this would naturally become more lax. It’s natural for Lyla to not mastering her homeland’s native tongue.”</p>\n<p>Bhela said that in a straight manner. That was a white lie, however. It was true that many noble families coming from the western side of Tiramikal Continent to forgot their western root and began to see themselves as southerners. But those were usually the case depending right circumstances, like exiled nobles, or some young masters who had lost in political battle branched out and fancied themselves a legit noble family with themselves at the helm. Blackwood Family weren’t exiled nobles, and though Lyla’s ancestors branching out some hundreds of years ago, that didn’t automatically made them cutting off ties with the original family. The main family of Blackwood was back in a western country called Tatalghia Kingdom, still sending letters and envoys from time to time to the branch Lyla was living in--although, undeniably, the southern branch of Blackwood Family had long developed and surpassed the main one.</p>\n<p>It seemed like Bhela already used to tell this lie. Anyone who heard this would be forced to accept it, unless they wanted to spend time and resources digging through the details--which to be honest, none of these pompous young girls were willing or simply unable to go through.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Elder Jhamil’s niece believed Lyla’s family exempt her to excel in foreign language. Yet she was still displeased inside. Her uncle told her that Bhela had been hogging the young noble’s influence for herself, everyone in Malikh Family already knew how Bhela Malikh carrying around the noble young lady yesterday. So what if she had some more bit of talent and had been running around overseas in that whatever seminars she was attending? A bumpkin origin wouldn’t be able to change their bumpkin bloodline. So if Bhela had the right to get close with the Young Lady of Blackwood Family, that meant someone coming from the same family should have the same change as her!</p>\n<p>The elder’s niece said, “Young Lady Bhela, I know the main family is prideful. But Young Lady Blackwood is here to experience the village slow life. Don’t you think she also needs to mingle with us commoners?”</p>\n<p>“Lyla will befriend any person she fancies herself, I don’t control with whom she wants to socialize with,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“If that’s the case, then why she still has no friends other than you?”</p>\n<p>“That’s not true!” Lyla cried indignantly, “I’ve made friends! With aunties! Aunties in the kitchen!”</p>\n<p>It was easy to be friendly with Lyla. She was always unconventional and never saw people by the social system. To her, people only divided by two types, those who gave her food and those who didn’t. She was like a cat. Just bring a good food and she’d be very friendly the next moment.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Lyla’s frank open-mindedness wasn’t easily accepted by some people. Elder Jhamil’s niece gasped as she looked at Lyla and Bhela, back and forth. “My goodness! Young Lady Bhela, were you letting a noble young lady such as Young Lady Blackwood mingle with dirty servants?!”</p>\n<p>“Why wouldn’t I?” Bhela asked back.</p>\n<p>“You--don’t young lady care about our family’s reputation? What if people said we’ve mistreated a noble young lady?”</p>\n<p>“Lyla is here to experience village slow life,” Bhela said slowly, “don’t you think she also needs to mingle with commoners?”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s niece was speechless as Bhela used her own words. The contorted expression on her chaky make-up face brought satisfaction for Lyla, who then snorted.</p>\n<p>“What now? Kitty got your tongue?” Lyla said with her mouth pouted. “So that you know, Sis Bhela already made speechless many many bullies like you! Who were many many many times smarter than you! This is what you get by making fun of me--shame on you, hmph! Who’s the stupid one, now?”</p>\n<p>Even after losing a round of squabble against Young Lady Bhela, unexpectedly the nobly young lady herself became hostile against her. All was so sudden that it made blood drained from her face.</p>\n<p>Bhela ruffled Lyla’s hair. Apparently Lyla still believed these girls came to bully her. When Lyla already made up her mind to not liking someone, it was hard to bend on her opinion.</p>\n<p>“Let’s go, Lyla. We’ll help aunties make sweets for afternoon lunch,” Bhela said. Back in the seminars, when Bhela asked Lyla to do some chores, the supposed noble young lady of Blackwood Family would move slowly, occasionally pouting and murmuring some complaints, unwilling to exert her calories on some boring stuff. However, it was different if the destination was kitchen. The spirit of lively bunny would come to possess her--she’d jolt, sprinting, unwilling to waste time as the promise of free sweets and delicious salty snacks was revealed before her.</p>\n<p>“What was that about?!” one of the le bonjour girls scowled after Bhela and Lyla was gone. “How could a young lady speaks like that?”</p>\n<p>“Bhela must lead her around to act like that! Did you hear what she said? The noble young lady thinks we bully her or something.”</p>\n<p>“Aahhh! What a manipulative bitch! I really want to know what that little cunt said to make Young Lady Blackwood think we had made fun of her. No way in hell someone would dare making fun of a noble like her!”</p>\n<p>Actually, Lyla was made fun of so many times. Especially during her study in the seminars abroad. She made fun of so much that she formed a survival instinct to hide behind Bhela’s back. But they didn’t know that. They just assumed as a young lady coming from a noble family, Lyla Blackwood would be adequately pure noble in stories and gossip. The main reason Bhela brought Lyla away was so that Lyla didn’t have to mingle with these delusional le bonjour girls.</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-3/chapter-62":"<p>When the news about what happened in Malikh Family’s ngajen ceremony arrived at Blackwood Family, Madam Blackwood was so enraged she broke the tea cup she held onto the floor. Establishing the family’s foot in Badril Village was supposed to be easy, but not only he failed to gain the support of Malikh Family and the villagers, the Young Master of Blackwood Family somehow managed to incite the bedridden patriarch’s supporters to regain their lost foothold against the corrupt Malikh Family’s elders.</p>\n<p>“There’s no point keeping him in that rural village,” Madam Blackwood said. She was a flamboyant, late thirty years old woman whose beauty was so superior that the previous viscount adopt her as a daughter. “Call Frane back to the city, he’s going to spend two months training in capital!”</p>\n<p>The butler who was waiting for her bowed and went away to carry out the task.</p>\n<p>“How’s Lyla’s birthday party going?”</p>\n<p>“Reply to madam, the party has started, the guests who came only from baron nobilities and mid-rank merchants,” a maid replied.</p>\n<p>The madam glanced the timid middle-aged man who sat on the same table as her. She scoffed, saying, “Look how your daughter made a name for herself. Not only the bribe money was wasted away, she coming on trips in the seminars only resulting her made a fool out of herself! Hah, like father, like daughter! Imbecile!”</p>\n<p>Madam Blackwood hurled the new cup that recently poured with hot, scalding tea. She purposely aimed at the table so the hot water splashed on the viscount’s hands. The timid viscount didn’t make a sound when his hands getting burnt, he didn’t dare to fight against his wife. It was already ten years too late for him to retaliate in any way. From the way he dragged his limping leg to fetch damp towel for his scaling skin, it was clear the waiting servants already used to ignore him.</p>\n<p>Recently, his wife’s mood had became the worst ever since their youngest daughter came back from the two years seminars. Unlike Frane--who only registered as his son by blood in papers, Lyla hadn’t show any particular talents in becoming a Class worthy of a noble family. She had a decent progress speed, a Level 7 Novice after seminars, but that progress mainly because she never had the interest to train herself. Madam Blackwood had bribed the officials so Lyla could enter the seminars supposed to boost her standing in high society, so she could catch higher ranking nobles eyes somehow. However, that plan failed in the worst way that could happen to a noble family like the Blackwood. She made blunders and broke rules so many times that she became a laughing stock. The only families that interested in her only lower rank nobles and not-so well off merchant families.</p>\n<p>“There also no point keeping that useless girl forever in the mansion,” Madam Blackwood said. “Send her to Badril Village by tomorrow. Make some smart men tending to her needs--they have to smart enough to know how to reel those Malikh villagers to say yes when I send my words in the future!”</p>\n<p>After the son’s failure, the madam would send her daughter, to do nothing but play around in Malikh Family. Even if there was something the girl could do, the madam surely wouldn’t choose this daughter of hers who she deemed too brainless to do even the simplest tasks. Her daughter was just that useless to her. The one with received the orders were people who accompanied her, who had experience in bribing and coercing. They were tasked to devour Malikh Family from the inside. The Blackwood would surely corner Bhela Malikh this time.</p>\n<p>Somewhere else, in a colorless courtyard, a birthday party already went on for about two hours. Most guests already leaving, not unlike the year before the two-years seminars happened when the sons of noble families dallying around waiting for a chance to talk with the young lady. Today, the Young Lady of Blackwood Family turned fourteen, two years before she would considered mature, but this young miss still pouting her mouth like a little girl.</p>\n<p>The old handmaid saw her young lady was bored and offered a treat.</p>\n<p>“Young lady, try this cake. A certain famous bakery made this just for your birthday.”</p>\n<p>The cake served on a small plate along with a silver fork. The girl took only mere seconds to finish it.</p>\n<p>“Is it good?” the handmaid asked.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t matter if it’s good or not, Aunt Jiji, I still hungry with this tiny minny bit of cake! Let me eat that one!” the girl pointed at the layered cake served on the center of the party.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Lyla, you can’t!”</p>\n<p>“Why can’t I?!”</p>\n<p>“You must present yourself as a proper young lady, so you can’t!”</p>\n<p>The cake was to be portioned to serve for the same amount of guests since the last party, but because the Blackwood Family’s young lady had a bad reputation in the seminars, most invited families didn’t actually come.</p>\n<p>“But I can’t be a lady if I’m hungry, am I?”</p>\n<p>“You must learn the way. Be patient, Young Lady Lyla!”</p>\n<p>“But I am huuungriiiiieeeehhh!!!”</p>\n<p>Aunt Jiji was terrified when she realized the young lady wasn’t referred only to portion of the cake, but she wanted to eat the whole cake. This shorty girl, although her feature was thin with only her cheeks got plump, actually had a talent to be a terrifying glutton that would be seen in Tiramikal Continent every one hundred years. It was a useless talent that brought only shame to Blackwood Family.</p>\n<p>It was fortunate that before the young lady could make a big ruckus, a maidservant came to bring the news about the madam’s decision. Aunt Jiji passed it to the young lady immediately.</p>\n<p>“You heard that, young lady! Madam is going to send you for a vacation!”</p>\n<p>Lyla’s head straightened, she forgot to pout. “Vacation? Where? Where where?”</p>\n<p>“To Badril Village!”</p>\n<p>“Badril Village?” the girl tilted her head. “Where’s that?”</p>\n<p>“If you promise Aunt Jiji not to eat too much cake today, Aunt Jiji will tell you where it is…”</p>\n<p>“I will if it turned out somewhere fun!”</p>\n<p>“Badril Village is where Young Lady Bhela’s home place!”</p>\n<p>“Sis Bhela’s home?!” Lyla gasped, “yahoooo!!!”</p>\n<p>Ignoring that she was the center of attention, Lyla suddenly jumped and danced like no tomorrow. Aunt Jiji tried to stop her, but it was futile since Lyla only promised not to be glutton. The remaining guests began whispering with each other. They were people who doubted the rumors about this Young Lady Blackwood, but after seeing how childish and ridiculous the girl danced, people were finally convinced. How was this a viscount’s daughter supposed to act? The girl danced her hips and hopped around like a bunny that had an itchy bum. Soon, the Young Lady Lyla Blackwood fell to the bottom list of desired young ladies to marry. Her reputation fell from not-so-smart, to stupid, and then fell again to brainless and imbecile. People didn’t see her in a good light. But that just how a girl named Lyla Blackwood really was.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Yashura Family got a peculiar visitor these past two days. He introduced himself as an expert from overseas, and somehow this foreign expert became interested in Shira Yashura. When the story leaked by insiders from Yashura Family, people were scratching their heads, wondering what could an educated man saw from this trash who could only get himself to level 3 Novice. Some people even sneered, saying that whole news was just Yashura Family’s little trick to clear up rumors from their heir’s name.</p>\n<p>“You understand, kiddo? There are three mandatory rules if someone wants to meet privately with me. First rule, it’s a <em>she</em>, not <em>he</em>. Second rule, big boobs. Third rule, in her lower part, there must be big bubbly butts, as big as her boobs. <em>Anything</em> lesser than that you can just send them back to wherever they came from.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit said that as he moved his chess piece, eating one of Shira’s pawns.</p>\n<p>“And remember, my standard is pretty high. Consult with how loadful those girls from Big-Boobed Sect are for more information,” the Nalaq continued.</p>\n<p>“Please don’t talk nonsense. I’m being serious here,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“Ey, I’m not talking nonsense. The girls from Big-Boobed Sect are real deal, okay? They’re huge! If you don’t believe me then you should go to Elzhier Family one of these days, go check out how glorious their boobs are. They always dance or become the maidservants when they’re not on duties.”</p>\n<p>“Ol’ Good-Natured Spirit… I don’t want to hear this imaginary all-woman sect of yours. Elzhier Family is only a normal rural family, they don’t host any sect members within their walls. If they did, the Village Head would boast about it at my uncle’s face every single day.”</p>\n<p>“You just don’t believe it because you never see how great they are--their boobs, I mean. How great those melons inside tight suits are! Just think about it; leather suits and melons--two entirely different things but if they come together they’d jiggling in harmony. This Good-Natured Spirit approved their sense of style.”</p>\n<p>“Forget about it, it’s not important--”</p>\n<p>“Boobs are important, ey!”</p>\n<p>Shira waved his hand as he didn’t want to continue this nonsense. He then moved a piece and finished his turn. He returned the topic back again, “The expert said he came from a first-tier faction called Blue Robe Society. If we can get his faction’s recognition then at least my family can silence all those rumors about me--especially the recent ones, they really are becoming a pain in the ass.”</p>\n<p>“I told you. I don’t talk with guys. No boobs, no good. Period.”</p>\n<p>“You are really becoming a pain in the ass,” Shira complained.</p>\n<p>After Shira said that, Good-Natured Spirit’s knight jumped over a wall of pawns to get on his bishop. Within a single breath Shira immediately moved his rook, creating a chain reaction that exposes the Nalaq’s defence, resulting his king trapped in three different direction.</p>\n<p>“Check mate.”</p>\n<p>“Ey, what the fu--” Good-Natured Spirit rage quit, flipping the chess board. “Hah! I knew it! You brat, you intentionally make me talk about boobs in order to lower my guard, right?! Fuck! That is how it is, isn’t it?!”</p>\n<p>“No, it is not.”</p>\n<p>“You sneaky bastard. You really got me,” Good-Natured Spirit threw his hands up in the air. <br>\n“Man, I surrender, that is some sick psychological tactic you got there.”</p>\n<p>“Now I don’t really know what you’re talking about.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit waved his hands in surrender, then he lit a cigarette. “Anyway, what do you want from me this time? Money again? I prepared some kobe coins enough for you to buy some candy, here, take this.”</p>\n<p>Shira shoved back the coin bag. “Not today. I just want you to meet Sir Baront Staterwind.”</p>\n<p>“No boobs, no good. Ask something else. How about I tell you the secret place where are those Big-Boobed Sect girls take their bath, ‘ey? Seems fair deal to me.”</p>\n<p>“How many times do I have to tell you--”</p>\n<p>“Sssshhh!!” Good-Natured Spirit hushed the boy. He then whispered, “you hear that?”</p>\n<p>Because the Nalaq suddenly became vigilant, Shira instinctively lowered his voice too. “Hear what?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“I heard some rats watching us…” the Nalaq covered his mouth, as if he didn’t want people to read lips what he said next, “some big-boobed rats…”</p>\n<p>“Huh… what?”</p>\n<p>“The girls from Big-Boobed Sect… they’re here…”</p>\n<p>“The heck are you talking about? This hill is Yashura Family’s property--”</p>\n<p>“Sssshhhh! They’ve noticed me noticing them. Wait here, I’mma get you some melons for your reward!”</p>\n<p>After he saying that, Good-Natured Spirit’s figure melting into the thin air.</p>\n<p>Shira Yashura sighed. At times, asking favor to this vulgar Nalaq not only difficult, it also unpredictable he’d only incite troubles if he not careful.</p>\n<p>After his winning streak for more than half a year maybe he became cocky. He forgot the Nalaq wasn’t there to solve his problem whenever he wanted, although the Nalaq sort of ended up like that after a few months he came here. Shira got some thinking, maybe he should stop seeing this Nalaq as his convenient piggy bank for his own good.</p>\n<p>“Really, he always making a mess for me to clean. I wonder if such thoughtless Nalaqs like him are common around here… now, where’s the last piece again?” he sighed for the second time.</p>\n<p>When he was picking up chess pieces that board Good-Natured Spirit flipped earlier, Shira realized there was a missing piece. Turned out it was stuck in the hole between tree roots.</p>\n<p>He plunged his hand to look for the missing chess piece.</p>\n<p>“Ugh… my fingers can’t reach.”</p>\n<p>He tried to squirm his body to fit his hand in.</p>\n<p>“Where is it again?”</p>\n<p>He frowned. He squirmed his body again really hard.</p>\n<p>“Oh, there it--”</p>\n<p><em>BOOOOOMMMMM!!!!</em></p>\n<p>An explosion happened not far away from the place he used to hang out, creating a wave of rolling dust that swept over the hill. Shira got his hand stuck between the tree rots, he could only hugged his head with his free hand and waited for the shockwave to finish. The chess pieces he gathered already nowhere to be found. He cooked up his head, looking left and right, and saw the greeny grasses were covered with dirts and trees were uprooted. The whole hill became a shithole kind of mess.</p>\n<p>Before the boy could swallow what was going on, a chuckle could be heard near him. Before him, Good-Natured Spirit emerged, coiling around the Nalaq’s body were purple-colored living flames that hungrily tried to eat him whole.</p>\n<p>As carefree as he usually was, Good-Natured Spirit said with a grin, “Those Big-Boobed Sect girls sure are feisty. They’re escaping too fast, I can’t get you melons. I managed to get a feeling of their butts, though. Here, there’s some fragrant left behind.”</p>\n<p>Shira stepped back when the Nalaq offered his palm. It was still on fire, the boy didn’t want to get burn along with him. Besides, he didn’t want to get involved with the Nalaq’s deprived hobby.</p>\n<p>“Sure you don’t want it?” Good-Natured Spirit took a last sniff from his palm, followed by a low chuckle of his.</p>\n<p>“Good-Natured Spirit… what’s that fire?”</p>\n<p>“Yeah? Dunno, man. Exorcism flame or something.”</p>\n<p>“Ohh… oh, it’s very nice to know you up until know. Good bye.”</p>\n<p>“Hmm? You want to go somewhere?” Realizing the purple flame was getting annoying, Good-Natured Spirit then patted away the coiling flame from his shoulders like it was nothing.</p>\n<p>Shira shrugged his shoulders. It seemed this bastard Nalaq was too tough for that exorcism flame. Maybe the flame was too ordinary? Whatever, he didn’t care about that anymore. His eyes then swept the ruin around him. He said, “You can’t forget about the meeting for today. But please clean the mess you made yourself.”</p>\n<p>“That’s what you want for the chess reward?”</p>\n<p>Shira nodded.</p>\n<p>“Aye, aye, will do.” Good-Natured Spirit flicked his fingers, and human-sized paper cranes came out of thin air. They were obedient, not clear whether were monsters or just magical devices. The paper cranes used magnet-like magic to carry the messy uprooted trees and boulders, along with sweeping the dirt from the grass. The cleaning up might take a while, since the hill really was a mess. Shira, feeling a little light on the head, facepalming as he returned back to Yashura Family.</p>\n<p>The whole explosion could be heard from all over Badril Village. It wasn’t clear what its cause, but Yashura Family sent guards to prevent people from knowing what really happened. In Yashura Family’s guest hall, Patriarch Shuro Yashura, a few good Yashura Family elders, and the respected visitor, Sir Baront Staterwind, forming a circle as they sat cross-legged, discussing the explosion that had just occurred.</p>\n<p>“Good elders, Sir Patriarch Yashura, I know you must get excited when I said Young Master Shira has some talent in communicating with Nalaqs. However, a Nalaq still a Nalaq. You must not offend a Nalaq whatsoever, or the consequence is dire! Young Master Shira’s life is way more important than getting a qualification to enter my school!” Sir Baront Staterwind warned. His forehead was still wet with sweat, since he hurriedly ran to Yashura Family when he realized the direction of recent explosion.</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, you’re right, Sir Staterwind. Absolutely right! I already sent someone to check on my nephew’s condition, please calm down,” Patriarch Shuro said.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront shook his head. “You don’t really know what I’m trying to say, do you? You should prepare a very good healer or a doctor, Patriarch Shuro, because if it isn’t death, one can easily lose a limb over angering a Nalaq! That happens more often than you think!”</p>\n<p>The elders drew cold breaths in unison when they heard that. Patriarch Shuro, whose face already pale, becoming even whiter than a sheet of paper. If they boy lost a limb, Shira’s chance to succeed him as the next patriarch could be swept away like specks of dust.</p>\n<p>Yulong the Butler arrived. Everyone in the room had been anxiously waiting for him they instinctively stood up when Yulong approached.</p>\n<p>“Yulong, how’s Shira doing?” Patriarch Shuro asked.</p>\n<p>Yulong replied, “Young Master Shira is back, patriarch. But Madam Yashura sent him to the kitchen for a second breakfast.”</p>\n<p>“Breakfast? What’s a breakfast has something to do with that explosion? Can he still walk?”</p>\n<p>“He’s walking fine, Patriarch Yashura.”</p>\n<p>“Then, Yulong, please go fetch my nephew for me, we have something urgent to tell him!”</p>\n<p>After his trained elegant bow, Yulong stepped back and proceeded to do the task given to him.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront Staterwind peered at the butler’s back. He traveled southern lands many times, visiting many villages, yet, he seldom heard a Mossack descent major family employed western-style butler. What made him confused even more that Sir Kurusiya apparently knew the butler and gave his respect to him, which Sir Baront Staterwind didn’t expect that coming from the cold eastern Kaya swordsman.</p>\n<p>“Dear good elder,” Sir Baront Staterwind asked a random elder who sat beside him, “may I know why there’s a butler working here?”</p>\n<p>“Is Sir referring to Yulong? Yulong isn’t actually working for Yashura Family, but Young Master Shira’s mother’s attendant. I can’t tell you the details, so forgive me sir, all I can say is Young Master Shira’s father is exceedingly brave and awesome he managed to woo a respectable lady many years ago.”</p>\n<p>“Ahhh…” Sir Baront nodded. The boy apparently a result of his parent eloping. The Blue Robe Society expert of course knew etiquette to hold himself from digging the story further.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, Yulong came back with Shira followed behind. The boy wore new clothes since his previous one was dirty. When he saw the group of elders and the expert guest looking at him, Shira sighed inside his heart. He knew he had to clean Good-Natured Spirit’s mess once again.</p>\n<p>“Greetings, elders… greetings, uncle patriarch… greetings, Sir Staterwind…”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro impatiently treading forward. “Shira my boy, is it true that you lost your limbs?”</p>\n<p>“I’m unhurt, uncle, see?” Shira waved both of his hands to prove that his limbs still functioned as they should be.</p>\n<p>“Oh! God, thank God! Really! These are really your hands, aren’t they? Not a fake one made with wood?” Patriarch Shuro Yashura grabbed his nephew hands and waved it around like a child playing with flags.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira,” Sir Baront opened his mouth, “I reckon you failed to ask the Nalaq to meet me? If you can’t do it, young master, it best for you not to push him any further. Today, you offend him and he blast the hill behind your Yashura Family as a warning, but what happens if you make the same mistake tomorrow?”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro nodded at his words vigorously. “Sir Baront is right, Shira my boy. A Nalaq is a revered being ancient Mossacks worshiped as their guardian angel. The consequence of making them mad is very dire! You should know better, my boy, you should’ve told your uncle if a Nalaq came to you the first time!”</p>\n<p>Sir Baront and his uncle Patriarch Shuro had good intentions in telling him about how to be respectful to a Nalaq. But the more Shira heard their warning, the more he doubted about Good-Natured Spirit being a “revered” Nalaq like they said. Of course, saying the truth about the explosion’s true cause resulting only Yashura Family losing face in front of Sir Baront Staterwind. Shira had no choice, he had to tread the matter very carefully.</p>\n<p>“<em>Cough, cough</em>… Uncle, Sir Baront, thank you for your concern. Truth is, it wasn’t that the Nalaq being mad that causes the explosion, but there was some… accident… that happened right before.”</p>\n<p>“With what title do you usually call him, Young Master Shira?” Sir Baront asked.</p>\n<p>“As far as I know, he doesn’t have a title. At least he didn’t tell me if he ever had one. He told me to call him ‘Good-Natured Spirit’.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, with that kind of nickname, he must be a very benevolent person when he was alive,” Sir Baront concluded as he rubbed his beard. “So, Young Master Shira, it seems he didn’t really intent to blast into smithereens.”</p>\n<p>Shira nodded. That part was true. Instead, someone else happened to be intending to blast this Nalaq into smithereens.</p>\n<p>“Thank God! Thank God! If he is a good Nalaq, maybe we don’t need to throw the second ngajen ceremony for this month, after all!” Patriarch Shuro Yashura exclaimed. The elders in the guest hall followed his exclaiming by handclapping and joyful cries. Ngajen ceremony only held once a month so the village safe from angry Selaqs, no one ever tried it to protect themselves from intelligent Nalaqs. Since the village was founded, the locals never had a Nalaq dwelling there. So it was natural for the elders to worry about throwing a ceremony they didn’t know working or not. Ngajen ceremony was expensive, after all.</p>\n<p>The more Shira saw how the previous tense hall turned jubilant and full of relieved faces, the more awkward he became. That Nalaq might call himself ‘Good-Natured Spirit’, yet he was anything but good. A low-life spirit who no doubt had been using the invisibility traits of spirits to commit many deprived crimes. He was closer to evil spirit incarnation than a good-natured one. The misunderstanding was too great his face twisted as if he’d just taste a sour lemon.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront Staterwind said, “Still, since he seems reluctant to use his old name, I reckon the Nalaq that approaching you is a low-tier one, Young Master Shira. Low-tier Nalaqs usually spirits that gain consciousness merely by luck. They don’t have factions backing them, and fortunately--in my experience--it easier to initiate negotiation with unaffiliated Nalaqs.” A hint of pride then flashed through his eyes, he continued, “my disciples will arrive tomorrow morning. One of them contracted with a high-tier Nalaq. Since the Nalaq’s mood turned sour is partly my fault, with help from the Nalaq contracted with one of my disciples, I will ask him to leave Yashura Family peacefully!”</p>\n<p>“Sir Staterwind is wise! Thank you for your concern, Sir!” Patriarch Shuro sang praises toward this expert. The elders of Yashura Family followed suit.</p>\n<p>“As expected of such expert!”</p>\n<p>“Sir Staterwind is the best of bunch of all experts that I know all my life!”</p>\n<p>“Hurray for Sir Staterwind!”</p>\n<p>They circling Sir Baront Staterwind and, not long after that, someone started to prostate. They behaved as if the guest was their one and only savior. Even Shira was getting embarrassed from seeing the scene, not to mention the already flushing Baront Staterwind.</p>\n<p>When everyone getting carried away, Shira slipped out after excusing himself. He knew he was no match for the Yashura Family’s older generations’ shamelessness. Upon walking outside, he saw Yulong was standing by the hall’s door looking galant as usual with his butler professionalism.</p>\n<p>“Can you please try to stop my uncle, Yulong? Sir Staterwind is started to get uncomfortable there.”</p>\n<p>Yulong glanced at the whole mess inside, and then he said to his young master, “I think it’s not everyday an expert coming to Yashura Family, young master, so let’s count this as Patriarch Yashura to gaining favors from a foreign expert.”</p>\n<p>“Are they really okay, though?”</p>\n<p>Yulong smiled.</p>\n<p>“Of course they aren’t, young master. But Patriarch Shuro and the family elders are honest people. Although sometimes they can be overwhelming, I’m sure Sir Staterwind can see no falsehood in their words.”</p>\n<p>Shira looked at those elders inside once again. The more he saw, the more he realized that those hysterical village men calling a man they barely knew these past two days a savior by no means a lie from their part. The elders really were freaking out when they heard the explosion. And Patriarch Shuro Yashura was the most worried of the bunch, considering him a patriarch and an uncle. Thinking about it all again, Shira couldn’t really say he still embarrassed seeing the elders spewing exaggerated flattering with straight faces.</p>\n<p>“Sir Staterwind comes from a respectable sect. Someone like that won’t get to travel the southern lands if he didn’t know the nature of the local people. So it best not to worry about it too much, young master,” Yulong said.</p>\n<p>“Really… ah, speaking of sects,” Shira deliberately changed the topic, “I heard from someone that one of the major families in Badril Village hosts members of a certain sect in secret. You’re from outside, Yulong--do you think something so outrageous like that could happen?”</p>\n<p>“Some older sects have long reaching influence, but I don’t think anyone would be interested to plant their own in Badril Village. There’s nothing valuable here for them to take notice.”</p>\n<p>“As I thought. It’s just unthinkable to think some secret powers lurking beneath our everyday lives. What if some experts actually pretending to be servants here in Yashura Family?”</p>\n<p>Although it wasn’t noticeable, Yulong’s smile became stiff.</p>\n<p>“You jest, young master. If that was true, do you think your uncle and the elders can take that kind of truth?”</p>\n<p>Following Yulong’s gaze, Shira peeped the hall and saw Sir Baront’s awkward figure, where he was in the center of Yashura Family elites--all of them-- who passionately prostrating in the floor. They practically worshipping him now.</p>\n<p>“You’re right…” Shira could only hide his face with his palm. Just when he thought he could understand them, the boy then wished he didn’t know these shameless men.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>As far as the current generation of Badril Village locals knew, they never got visited by nobles until this month Malikh Family’s ngajen ceremony happened. Everyone still talking about it.</p>\n<p>Young Master of Blackwood Family only stayed in Badril Village in one day. And the noble carriage of Blackwood Family set off out of Badril Village by noon. The next morning after the day he was gone, the two foreign guests who had been staying in Malikh Family, Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia, felt overstaying might be unnecessary, thus decided to leave too.</p>\n<p>Because the carriages going out from Badril Village mostly for public transports, Bhela personally asked an elder from his father’s faction who had a horse carriage to give her guests a ride to the nearest town, where they’d later book a private carriage for them to return home. Mister Harrington, as an unsocial bachelor as he always was, was waiting in the carriage for Madame Sylvia to say her parting words to Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>“You have a very bright future, Young Lady Bhela. A girl with limitless potential. So your favor will become very valuable as you mature,” Madame Sylvia said. “If you need something, you can always send letters to my sect. Don’t hold back. Just think about this of us making an investment.”</p>\n<p>Since Bhela a smart girl anyway, Madame Sylvia decided not to make her words fancy and told her in a straightforward manner. Bhela appreciated her honesty, and said her thanks.</p>\n<p>The carriage then set off. In the main gate of Badril Village, the guards on duty witnessed the recently blazing popular Young Lady Bhela Malikh bowing her body as she sent off two foreigners in traveling clothes made from expensive linen.</p>\n<p>“Look at how she is,” inside the carriage, Madame Sylvia said to Mister Harrington. “She’s a pretty sensible girl, don’t you think?”</p>\n<p>“She is,” Mister Harrington said softly, almost a murmur.</p>\n<p>It was hard to start a conversation whenever Mister Harrington sat with his arms crossed tightly. Madame Sylvia could see that he wasn’t exactly happy with the outcome regarding Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>There was no bandits lurking around, and no monsters occasionally came out, proved that the lands around Badril Village actually well-protected--too well, perhaps, for a rural village without a major power backing them. Their journey was smooth without disturbance. Thirty minutes after they left Badril Village, they encountered another carriage painted with black-jet color. The black carriage was well-decorated with golden-colored plates, obviously elites or nobles were traveling inside.</p>\n<p>However, unlike common nobles who liked to hide in the carriage to show-off their elegance and aloofness, this carriage simply out of commonsense. To talk about how weird this carriage was there was a need to point out the refreshing greenness of the view around. Despite there being a road far away from settlement, hint of liveliness from bird chirping--along with croaking frogs from nearby streams and singing insects--completed the idyllic road with a strange harmony that invited light-hearted person to sing along with lively nature. That was exactly what the noble in the black carriage doing. A young lady with a very girly and childish feature was carefreely sitting in the window in spite of pale servants begging her to sit still. She completely dumb about the servants’ pleas. And with her personality, nobody knew whether she was pretending or not. The only thing that the jubilant Lyla Blackwood cared about was singing an off-tune song about her befriending village frogs and bunnies.</p>\n<p>“Prepare your life you frogs and bunnies~</p>\n<p>Cause I’m not letting you go before we become the best of buddies~~</p>\n<p>Wait for me you birdies and kitties~~</p>\n<p>Cause we’re about to become the best of all buddies~~ yuhuu~ yuhuu~~</p>\n<p>The best buddies in this lifetime~~ yuhuuuu~~~”</p>\n<p>There was nothing the servants and the guards could do to stop their young lady from singing this amazingly ugly song about her future exploits in Badril Village. Seeing that another carriage approaching, the horse-riding guards did their best to block the view to the crest planted on the carriage’s compartment. Their effort to save faces from the young lady’s mishap was futile, however, since the other party happened to know Lyla.</p>\n<p>“How many times have I told you to stay away from windows, Lyla!”</p>\n<p>“Whu--what? Who?” Lyla was surprised. But then she was elated to see a familiar face. “Is that you, Instructor Sylvia? You here to train Sis Bhela’s archery again?”</p>\n<p>“Get down from the window!” Madame Sylvia raised her voice.</p>\n<p>“I’m also here to meet Sis Bhela!” Lyla also raised her voice cheerfully.</p>\n<p>“Lyla, you won’t be able to get married in the future if you’re always act like this!” Madame Sylvia warned her. She long dropped title of Young Lady Blackwood when talking to this naughty girl.</p>\n<p>“Um!” Lyla nodded. “But which one do you like more, Instructor Sylvia, bunnies or kitties?” It was no use trying to talk sense to Lyla. Any warning only come to her right ear and gone out straight from the left one.</p>\n<p>“Stay away from the windows!!!” Madame Sylvia screamed until her voice shrilled.</p>\n<p>Lyla also screamed, “Good morning to you too!!!”</p>\n<p>Both carriages drifted apart after the brief encounter. It ended with Lyla happily waved her hands happily. Madame Sylvia sighed and shook her head. That girl was so naughty that the troubles she created made the seminars’ managements even considered to drop her once during the seminars. Only after Bhela Malikh convinced them she’d take care of Lyla they finally did let go the matter.</p>\n<p>Before, the black carriage of Blackwood Family came to Badril Village in the shroud of night’s darkness, so nobody noticed their elegance and the aura of expensive carriage blazing through the village road--of which was surprisingly wide for a settlement road, unlike road of cities in the western kingdoms, because long ago Mossack people needed to endure monster stampedes passing through their villages once every few months.</p>\n<p>“Mom, look, is that a noble?” a snotty kid pointing out the carriage.</p>\n<p>The mother hurriedly pulled her child. “Ssuuussh! Keep your finger to yourself! Don’t you know what happened to peasants that make noble angry from the stories they always talking about?”</p>\n<p>The steel-armored guards who escort the carriage scoffed them in disdain. Contrast with the escorts’ attitudes, Lyla waved her hand at them, while shouting, “Hey boy, don’t you think bunnies are cute as the kitties? Or do you like cats more?”</p>\n<p>The kid didn’t answer. He instead forced to bow by her mother and let the carriage went through silently. The villagers didn’t have the experience in receiving nobles, most of them--except for those who attended the ngajen ceremony in Malikh Family--had never saw nobles in their lives. Because of that they were awkward and didn’t know what to do.</p>\n<p>Lyla didn’t seem to mind their stiffness. Instead, she vigorously greeted everyone she saw from the window she sat on.</p>\n<p>“Good day! Good morning! I’m here to sleepover at Sis Bhela’s place! Do you know where Sis Bhela lives?”</p>\n<p>Back in Elzhier Family, in the main family’s house, their patriarch, hurriedly changed his clothes to a formal one he always used every ngajen ceremony.</p>\n<p>“Hurry, hurry! As the head of this village, how can I let a noble arriving without me receiving them?!”</p>\n<p>Not even he yet buttoned his shirt properly, the Village Head sprinted toward the main street, only to see the crowd of onlookers already dispersed and still talking about the scary nobles they always heard in stories were actually <em>weirdly</em> friendly.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Bhela Malikh was already notified about Lyla Blackwood’s arrival. She waited on a chair at the Malikh Family’s gate, drinking a fresh young coconut water occasionally. The black carriage finally was in her view. And the young girl she was waiting for happily waved her hand at her. From the window.</p>\n<p>“Carefull, Lyla!” Bhela yelled as she sprang from her chair.</p>\n<p>“Huuupp!” Lyla Blackwood simply didn’t want to waste anytime leaving the carriage through the door. So she simply jumped from the window she sat upon, before the carriage even stopped. It was fortunate that amongst Bhela’s skill as a Unique Class, she had <b>Haste</b>, which boosted her speed in short duration. She used that to catch Lyla before she hurt herself. The young noble girl landed splendidly in Bhela’s arm.</p>\n<p>“What’s this, Sistah?” Lyla’s eyes sparkled when she saw Bhela get a young coconut in her other hand. She was completely oblivious she just did something dangerous.</p>\n<p>“Young coconut. There’s still some of its water left. Here, try this,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“For me? Really?”</p>\n<p>“Drink slowly…”</p>\n<p><em>Glug glug glug</em>. Lyla drank the coconut in anything but in slowly manner. She even burped shamelessly.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Lyla, ah!” the butler who coming with her was in horror seeing how Young Lady Lyla Blackwood made a horrible mess by spilling the coconut water on her expensive, silk woven black dress. Only an equally expensive silk handkerchief worthy enough to wipe his young lady’s noble dress!</p>\n<p>“I told you to drink slowly…” Bhela said. She used her sleeve to wipe Lyla’s wet face, and then proceeded to also wipe Lyla’s dress.</p>\n<p>“Y-young miss!” the butler shouted in panic. His body jolted as soon as he saw the outrageous act of spoiling the young noble’s dress by making it contacted with commoner clothes. That was heresy! He needed her to stop before she contained Blackwood’s expensive dress with her commoner’s bacteria!</p>\n<p>“You need something?” Bhela looked at this unfamiliar butler of Blackwood Family. Her expressionless face judged the butler coldly.</p>\n<p>“My name is Tim, young miss--please use this!” the butler offered a silky smooth handkerchief with Blackwood Family’s crest embroidered on the surface. The handkerchief was actually the butler’s, was awarded to his great-great-great grandfather by the then Baron Blackwood for some sort of achievement that practically nobody was still alive to remember. Everytime Butler Tim met a new person, he’d make an excuse to show off this particular handkerchief. Today was no exception. It was his most precious handkerchief. Just from the look of it one could tell how crazy expensive it was.</p>\n<p>“Ah, ah… my nose… aahhh--” Lyla felt her nose was wet and itchy, “--ahhtchii!!!”</p>\n<p>“You’ve got a flu?” Bhela asked worriedly.</p>\n<p>“Yeah. Aunt Jiji told me to drink my medicine everyday but it’s so bitter. So much bitter that it’s evil!”</p>\n<p>“Where’s your medicine now?”</p>\n<p>“Oh. I throw it away last night.”</p>\n<p>Bhela shook her head.</p>\n<p>“That’s no good. You can’t throw away your medicine like that. Now, wipe your nose. This mister butler said to use this…” she put the handkerchief on Lyla’s nose, and Lyla blew her nose on it.</p>\n<p>Lyla gave back the handkerchief to Butler Tim. “Thank you, Sir Butler. It’s very helpful of you.”</p>\n<p>The butler received back his most precious handkerchief. Bonus Lyla’s snot.</p>\n<p>“Come on inside,” Bhela said to Lyla. “Even if the water runs dry, coconuts still have meat we can scoop. After that we’ll pick some star fruits that I planted since I was a child.”</p>\n<p>“Star fruits! Woohooo!”</p>\n<p>The girls then walked inside. Lyla was so excited she didn’t leave her friend, hanging on her neck like a koala being comfortable on a tree branch. The stories about a noble young lady coming to Malikh Family for Bhela Malikh spread amongst the maidservants like oil being poured on an open wildfire. The Malikhs couldn’t describe the pride seeing their eldest young lady with a blue blood friend. Especially the aunties. They watched how close Bhela and Lyla with teary eyes and happy smiles.</p>\n<p>“Young lady is… finally… finally…”</p>\n<p>“She finally has a friend…”</p>\n<p>“Huuu… huuu… merciful Goddesses finally saw the young lady’s plight and blessed her with a real friend… huuu huuuu….”</p>\n<p>Nobody more happier than the aunties who were familiar with how their Young Lady Bhela lived her live. They silently cried watching their young lady, who usually alone and unapproachable, finally grown up and had her first friend in these past ten years.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Butler Tim grimaced inside. Despite the fact that he was tasked to win over Bhela Malikh with any means necessary, he didn’t like this girl. It wasn’t because his handkerchief got dirty--well, maybe he resented her for it a little--it because the girl named Bhela Malikh wasn’t acting as a young country girl supposed to act. Country bumpkins supposed to falter when they saw the radiance seeped out of the nobles’ aura, they supposed to tremble when they saw the noble wealth glittering beneath the sun. But this girl was indifferent and aloof. She was cold but the coldness paired with concise and elegant mannerism. Butler Tim knew she trying to act noble herself. That was why he didn’t like her.</p>\n<p>However, Butler Tim was a smart person. Any smart person would wear a perfect smile despite his heart bleeding over the snot on his precious handkerchief. Before leaving the city, the butler didn’t forget to look for a gift he’d use to lower the Malikh Family’s guard. He heard the previous gift was rejected, and when he asked for the content of the gift, the smart Butler Tim shook his head as if he knew it would happen.</p>\n<p>Toward country bumpkins, too expensive gifts would never work. He knew this because he was smart. And because he was smart, he knew better gifts. Not-so-expensive gifts worked for country bumpkins.</p>\n<p>Therefore, he presented Bhela Malikh with popular city biscuits.</p>\n<p>“I heard this biscuit is currently very popular among noble young ladies. This butler happened to pass by a store that sold this, so I reckon Young Lady Bhela might love to taste some.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, because the elders roughly knew the Blackwood Family’s youngest lady would come to visit, two leaders of opposing factions came to watch how their Young Lady Bhela would receive the noble guest. Elder Jhamil was all smiling because he liked what he saw. But the expression of Elder Khasim turned sour when he saw how the butler of Blackwood Family tried to butter up to Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>“Don’t accept it, young lady, please….” Elder Khasim whispered under his breath. Of course, there was no single soul heard what he just said. He was worried the hard work to rebuild his faction’s morale all would turn into dust if people thought their spiritual mascot, the one and only Young Lady Bhela Malikh, could be bought with mere biscuits.</p>\n<p>Contrary to what Elder Khasim hoped, Bhela Malikh received the gift without even putting a second thought. A feeling of defeat surged inside him. Elder Jhamil looked at his rival with a mocking glance.</p>\n<p>After receiving the snacks, Bhela excused herself and brought Lyla with her to stroll around Malikh Family’s gardens. Butler Tim pretended to wave his hand and smiled, but inside, he was gloating at how hypocrite Bhela was. His guess that Young Lady Bhela wouldn’t refuse the gift he brought was entirely correct. Before, he deliberately said the biscuit was noble young ladies’ favorite. Thus, according to his smart logic, as long as it wasn’t too expensive that it’d scare this fake young lady, no way a noble wannabe would reject this kind of gifts.</p>\n<p>“Heh,” Butler Tim scoffed when Bhela and Lyla already left. “Bet you’ve never eaten any city biscuits your entire life, haven’t you.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, Bhela Malikh hadn’t had any city biscuits her entire life. Not before and also not today. What Butler Tim didn’t know was that the snacks he bought with his own money ultimately ended up returned to Blackwood Family--to be exact, it ended up inside Lyla Blackwood’s belly. Bhela couldn’t help but received the biscuits when, beside her, she saw Lyla was drooling looking at the biscuits.</p>\n<p>The elders led by Elder Jhamil then respectfully welcomed the butler along with servants and guards from Blackwood Family. From the impression alone, Butler Tim could see reasons for him to like this slick-tongued Elder Jhamil. He knew how to flatter and also he knew how to act humble in front of people with higher status than him. Not like that noble-wannabe Young Lady of Malikh Family. This Elder Jhamil knew that he was only a country bumpkin thus acted accordingly. Naturally, the smart Butler Tim was pleased.</p>\n<p>And so began Butler Tim’s quests to swallow Malikh Family with his smartly planned schemes and cunning political games.</p>\n<p>In mere hours, the neutral elders who hadn’t joined either both rivalling factions began flocking to Elder Jhamil’s side. One part because they wanted to side with the faction that had the noble support and another part simply because Elder Jhamil, with the help of Butler Tim, had been throwing around sweet deals over all directions.</p>\n<p>“Only one tenth of the elder council members don’t want to pick a side by now, but their number is too significant to be an obstacle for Sir Butler’s great plan,” Elder Jhamil reported the current situation to Butler Tim.</p>\n<p>The butler was enjoying a glass of tea served by the maid that supposed to serve Young Lady Lyla Blackwood as if he was the visiting noble himself. He nodded. “I see. With this, the first stage of my plan has been completed.”</p>\n<p>“Oohhh!” Elder Jhamil exclaimed. “Sir Butler summoned rain and fire by flipping Malikh Family’s political scene upside down, and this is only the first stage?! As expected, the Butler of Blackwood Family is very smart!”</p>\n<p>Butler Tim originally wanted to act aloof and sophisticated before he visited this rural village. However, upon being called a smart person, he couldn’t help but grinned widely. “Oho, you’re an interesting fella, aren’t you? Very well, since you’ve done a good job yourself, I won’t be so petty to grab all the credit. Tell me how I should do next, if I like what I hear, we might as well corporate your thoughts into my plan.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was excited. How could he not? An opportunity to rise beyond a mere elder of rural village was laid before him.</p>\n<p>“Sir Butler, you may not know this, but we Mossack people regard having a good meal very highly. Everytime we’re having breakfast or dinner together as the entire family, even though we’re always looked peaceful outside, those trivial events actually are a political battlefield for us elders to extend our influence! This lowly man himself used a few move in the past during breakfast to gather like-minded men under my banner. I used all my resources and connections in a single mealtime to attack my rivals! However, these past two days, my biggest rival used a lowly method against me…”</p>\n<p>“Oh? What did he do?” Butler Tim asked.</p>\n<p>“He didn’t do much,” Elder Jhamil said, sneering when he was talking about this rival of his, “all he did was inviting Young Lady Bhela everytime we were having a meal in the family hall. He’s been a stubborn and ignorant supporter of main family, but this time he actually knew how to use his connection with the main family to deal a blow against me. A few of the elders had been faltering when they saw Young Lady Bhela leaning over the other side; I’m afraid if we’re leaving this ignorant rival of me doing as he wanted, there’s gonna be a hole in Sir Butler’s smart plan!”</p>\n<p>Butler Tim swirled the tea in his cup as though he was deep in thought. Of course, if this proven to endanger his smart plan, the butler couldn’t sit still watching all that happened. “I heard the Mossacks are peculiar people, but I don’t know you Mossack people have a strange custom!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, we’re living here far away from the city, so of course our traditions might seem unsophisticated to wise westerners like Sir Butler,” Elder Jhamil fawned.</p>\n<p>“Then what do you suggest Blackwood Family should do in this situation, Elder Jhamil?”</p>\n<p>“It’s easy!” Elder Jhamil was so excited he almost jumped from his seat. “My rival faction used Young Lady Bhela to gain foothold, and we can also use that to deal a greater blow back to them!”</p>\n<p>“And that is?”</p>\n<p>“Of course, we can use--I mean, we can invite young noble miss to a dinner together with us. With this we can unofficially announce our alliance with Blackwood Family! It’s the final nail to main family’s faction!”</p>\n<p>Even though Bhela Malikh’s status as a Unique Class shone throughout all of Badril Village, her name still fall short with a pure noble like Lyla Blackwood. Madam back in Blackwood Family used her daughter so Blackwood could infiltrate Malikh Family easily, but that didn’t mean Lyla still wasn’t as useful.</p>\n<p>“Very well. Let us go with that,” then he asked the maid responsible for Lyla’s schedule. “What was Young Lady Lyla doing this afternoon?”</p>\n<p>The maid replied, “Young Lady Bhela Malikh carried her around to play. At first, they went to Malikh Family’s orchard to pick some fruits. Then they visited the sick Patriarch Malikh in his room for a few minutes. After that, they went outside to stroll and came back with a new rabbit pet they bought from other family. Finally, when the sun is setting, they went to the kitchen to watch the servants cooking.”</p>\n<p>“How uncouth for a noble young lady being led around in dirty places like that,” Butler Tim was displeased, but nothing he could do since making Bhela’s attention elsewhere meant he could move freely to make a trap for her. Nodding to himself, the butler then gave an instruction to the maid, “you go to Young Lady Lyla and tell that Malikh Family invite her for a dinner.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was excitedly rubbing his hands when Butler Tim said that. Finally, payback to those imbecile Elder Khasim!</p>\n<p>“But, Butler Tim…” the maid hesitated.</p>\n<p>“What is it?”</p>\n<p>“Malikh Family already invited Young Lady Lyla to have dinner. She’s eating in Malikh Family’s hall right now….”</p>\n<p>“Hmm, what do you mean?”</p>\n<p>What the maid meant was that someone in Malikh Family already brought Lyla to have dinner with them.</p>\n<p>When Butler Tim playing political games and scheming around in Malikh Family, Bhela Malikh, along with the elders friendly with Elder Khasim, had been giving bunch of candies and food for Lyla Blackwood, much more than the biscuits Butler Tim brought with him. Being a great foodie herself, Lyla never had enough, the first day in Malikh Family she ate more sweets and foods worth of one week back in Blackwood Family’s manor. Aunt Jiji and other Blackwood Family’s maid servants would freak out if they saw how glutton Lyla currently was.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the news that the main family’s faction hosting a dinner for a noble miss swept Malikh Family like a thunderstorm. The neutral elders Elder Jhamil had just bought flocking back toward Elder Khasim’s side. It was so sudden. Everyone wasn’t even got a breath to process what had happened. And this for sure was an unprecedented move ever since Patriarch Ghalim suddenly fell ill and retreated from the political scene.</p>\n<p>Just as one side was busy completing the first stage to win over the Young Lady of Malikh Family, the other side already won over Young Lady of the noble Blackwood Family. All happened in a span of a single day.</p>\n<p>“Y-young Lady Lyla…”</p>\n<p>Even Butler Tim couldn’t pull his own young miss seeing how happy she was. His plan had been jabbed in a completely unexpected way. Maybe he wasn’t so smart after all.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>It was unfortunate that Madam Malikh didn’t see the Young Noble Miss of Blackwood Family kindly. Even though the girl did nothing wrong, Madam Malikh wasn’t so muddled that she wasn’t aware what Blackwood Family and those corrupt elders conspiring against her husband and Malikh’s main family. Even Bhela herself couldn’t do anything to change her mother’s mind.</p>\n<p>However, Lyla Blackwood, an airhead as she always was, was oblivious of the hostility directed toward her.</p>\n<p>It was morning the second day Lyla in Badril Village. Following her friend Bhela, she carried a little box inside Patriarch Ghalim’s bedroom. This little box filled with custom-made medicines--most were amateurly mixed from two different trivial medicines, consisted of remedies for flu and headache. Nothing harmful but nothing useful at the same time. And just like yesterday, to pay for Bhela parents’ kindness for letting her staying in Malikh Family, Lyla Blackwood decided to play doctor a little bit.</p>\n<p>“Uncle, I’m coming again to help you feel better,” Lyla said as she dragged a chair and sat beside Patriarch Ghalim’s sick bed. Seeing the pale middle-aged man in bed, she blinked her googly eyes, then continued, “how’s yesterday medicine I gave you. Are you feeling a tiny minny bit better, perhaps?”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim certainly was feeling better these past few days, not because Lyla’s medicines, but Grandpa Piss’s diagnosis and remedies. Toward this girl, he weakly nodded. “Thank you for your help, little lady.”</p>\n<p>“Then I’m going to fed you my newest recipe, uncle. Here, here, open your mouth.”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghamil did what he was told. Because Lyla didn’t like bitter medicine, she added lots of brown sugar. Lots and lots of brown sugar.</p>\n<p>“It’s… sweet.”</p>\n<p>“Are you feeling better, now?” Lyla asked.</p>\n<p>“Yes, little lady, I’m feeling better.”</p>\n<p>As a matter of fact, he wasn’t. The medicine was more like a candy than remedy.</p>\n<p>“Good! If you eat this three times a day, maybe your illness would go away, uncle,” Lyla then sternly pointed out, “maybe!”</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh was nervous when her husband consumed the strange medicine Lyla gave him, but she didn’t open her mouth to protest. Bhela was changing the pillows’ sheet nearby, and doing some other chores that usually were done by the servants. In the meantime, Lyla was giving advice for Patriarch Ghalim liked how he should eat moderately three times a day, how he should brush his teeth after he ate sweets, and all the things Aunt Jiji told Lyla all the time.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to visit again, uncle, get well soon!” Lyla waved her hands. Carrying a broom in her hands, Lyla’s next schedule was following Bhela doing chores in the courtyard.</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim weakly waved his hand back. Of course, after the girls were already gone, he noticed his bitter wife biting her lips indignantly.</p>\n<p>“Don’t stare the girl so much. She’s not responsible for her family’s wrongdoings. It’s not like a girl her age knows what her parents do behind the scene.”</p>\n<p>“Why did you eat that? What if they used her to give you more poison?”</p>\n<p>“Bhela wouldn’t let me have the medicine if she didn’t what it was, no? Stop putting that kind of face, you only make our daughter feels awkward about all this.”</p>\n<p>The woman held her husband’s hand, kissing it with her forehead as she hid her face. She whispered, “Oh, don’t you know how hurt this heart holding back my grievance? Why did our daughter had to bring someone from that family inside our roof?” she sniffed, “how long this farce gonna last? What should I do in the mean time? Oh! I don’t know! I don’t know!”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim sighed as he witnessed his wife cried helplessly.</p>\n<p>In the courtyard, near the coops where Malikh Family raised chickens and ducks, Lyla was squatting in front of the new bunny she and Bhela bought just yesterday. She was waiting the whole morning just to feed this bunny. The bunny hopped around, itching to play in spite it couldn’t resist the temptation of delicious green leaves, again and again. Wathing how glutton the bunny was, Lyla found herself immerse in immense joy. She very much envying the life of a bunny. Perhaps that because she could relate to how it spent its day without worry; eating, playing, sleeping, then playing again--a life that she longed to have. If only she was born a rabbit instead of a young lady of noble family….</p>\n<p>The sound of the broom swept the ground took away her attention. Lyla couldn’t understand how a daughter of a patriarch like Bhela had to work so much.</p>\n<p>“Why do you work so much, Sistah?” Lyla asked when she found out there still much dry leaves Bhela had to sweep. “Won’t you get bored soon? Just let the servants clean this place.”</p>\n<p>Bhela, sweeping as if Lyla’s idleness didn’t bother her the slightest, replied, “Here in Badril Village, everyone who hasn’t done their coming of age ceremony has to do chores for their parents. It doesn’t matter if it’s the farmer’s daughter or the biggest family’s young lady, helping the matter of the household is one of the seven virtues we Mossack people get to do for our parents.”</p>\n<p>Originally, Lyla wanted her friend also playing with the bunny. But hearing Bhela just said something serious, there was no way she’d reveal her intention now. “My mom always nagging me to go to dance lesson or whatever. It’s very very boring,” she murmured, a bit dejected.</p>\n<p>“The west and the south have different values,” Bhela said. “Complete your virtue for your parents then you’ll grow to be a fine lady, Lyla.”</p>\n<p>“Uggghhh…” Lyla grunted as she didn’t want to continue the topic any further. She long developed a sense for her own survival to detect whether or not the conversation ended up she being forced to do some boring stuff. Knowing Bhela’s personality, Lyla knew soon Sis Bhela’d make her doing chores too. Grabbing the bunny, Lyla quickly escaped somewhere else so that she could spend her time playing. Bhela shook her head seeing the girl’s behavior.</p>\n<p>Bhela then noticed some servants whispering while they looking at Lyla from the distance. Many people were curious what a noble young lady like her would do in a rural place like this, and Bhela wasn’t that oblivious not to notice the eyes planted by the elders of Malikh Family.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, she then saw four girls dressed in expensive garments approaching Lyla with their mouth covered with feathered fans in their hands. Their clothing looked as if they attending some sort of ceremony, while in fact, they calculated that this kind of appearance was the most suitable for them to socialize with a girl of blue-blooded origin. Bhela recognized the leader of those girls was actually Elder Jhamil’s niece.</p>\n<p>“Have you read Le Armour dan Varoza written by Leornador De Gonzalez, Young Lady Blackwood?”</p>\n<p>“Ah, yes, that piece was adequately sophisticated but I think Vista van Gracious’s omnibus more than adequate, le banjour?”</p>\n<p>“I see, I see, their pieces adequately well-written as those senor themselves adequattely live as maestro. But perhaps equoliette more than fit the diagram as paradigm sensorita abligioate senor des adequately le banjour.”</p>\n<p>“But of course, Young Lady Blackwood is more addequately sophisitacted as it’s a noblesse obligiote to be more sohpisitacated than us village senioritas. Perhaps le banjour is fortuna with de gracious by Young Lady’s great wisdom?”</p>\n<p>Lyla blinked her eyes trying to decipher whatever these girls mean. The bunny in her arms even escaped amidst her confusion.</p>\n<p>“Uhh… uhhh…” Lyla timidly stepped back from the feathered fan girls. “I think Sis Bhela is calling me…”</p>\n<p>She swiftly ran away back to her friend Bhela.</p>\n<p>“Sistah, Sistah Bhela!” Lyla cried and grabbing Bhela’s sloven sleeve tightly, demanding for justice, “they came to bully me!”</p>\n<p>“What did they do?” Bhela asked.</p>\n<p>“They know I can’t speak western language! They came to test me! They’re even worse than those rich girls in seminar--they jumble some western mumbo jumbo into plain language in order to confuse me! They must be laughing and call me stupid by now!”</p>\n<p>Hearing Lyla’s grievance, Bhela patted her head in order to let the girl calmed down.</p>\n<p>“Lyla, those girls are different than the noble girls that always making fun of you.”</p>\n<p>“Different? How so?”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at the girls who also was watching them back while fanning themselves with their fabulous feathered fans.</p>\n<p>“They looked like noble descendants, but actually were not.”</p>\n<p>“I still don’t like them nonetheless!”</p>\n<p>“You don’t have to talk to them if you don’t want to,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>Yet Lyla still restlessly tugging Bhela’s sleeves, making it harder for her to do her chores. Before the peers that always making fun of her, Lyla was always helpless and had been depending on Bhela’s figure as a shield. What it looked like from the point of view of an outsider was a scene where a young mother being tested of her patience dealing with a girl who was throwing a tantrum.</p>\n<p>Seeing that the young noble miss wouldn’t come back soon, the feathered fan girls approaching Bhela and Lyla instead.</p>\n<p>“Oh, fancy to meet Young Lady Bhela here, le banjour!”</p>\n<p>“Le bonjour…” Bhela hesitated to reply back. Tilting her head slightly, she studied the pompously dressed girls before her. These girls were relatives of Malikh Family’s elders. None of them could match with Bhela if talking strictly about social status wise, not to mention talents. However, while she was holding her broom, it looked like Bhela was the one with common origin, while these girls were floating swans who happened to be generous enough to greet plebeians with their <em>unique</em> vocabulary.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Lyla Blackwood hid behind Lyla’s back. Despite a noble origin herself, meeting more cocky and fake young ladies than the girls before her were rare experience for Lyla.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela, fancy to meet you. Good morning. The weather is nice. I eat snails everyday,” Elder Jhamil’s niece took the lead and said that with a hint of inflated pride.</p>\n<p>Bhela narrowed her eyes. She could see why Lyla instantly hated these girls. She then said in a sleek foreign language, “Je ne sais pas de quoi tu parles. Si vous ne parlez pas une langue étrangère, fermez simplement la bouche, sinon vous faites peur aux enfants avec votre non-sens.”</p>\n<p>The feathered fan girls blinked their eyes trying to decipher whatever Bhela had said.</p>\n<p>“Oh, it turns out Young Lady Bhela is aquadettely know some le banjour!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, Young Lady Bhela is adequately sophisticated after all. Me gusta!”</p>\n<p>“I see, I see, le pasta fortuna is delicosaza.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s niece didn’t say anything as she only maintained a sweet smile while being nervous herself. Racking her brains over remembering the contents of thick dictionary, she tried to form a decent sentences in foreign language. But Bhela then cut off her train of thought before she could say a word.</p>\n<p>“Blackwood Family is migrating noble that has long been making their roots here in southern land. Hundred of years living far away from their western peers, noble families like this would naturally become more lax. It’s natural for Lyla to not mastering her homeland’s native tongue.”</p>\n<p>Bhela said that in a straight manner. That was a white lie, however. It was true that many noble families coming from the western side of Tiramikal Continent to forgot their western root and began to see themselves as southerners. But those were usually the case depending right circumstances, like exiled nobles, or some young masters who had lost in political battle branched out and fancied themselves a legit noble family with themselves at the helm. Blackwood Family weren’t exiled nobles, and though Lyla’s ancestors branching out some hundreds of years ago, that didn’t automatically made them cutting off ties with the original family. The main family of Blackwood was back in a western country called Tatalghia Kingdom, still sending letters and envoys from time to time to the branch Lyla was living in--although, undeniably, the southern branch of Blackwood Family had long developed and surpassed the main one.</p>\n<p>It seemed like Bhela already used to tell this lie. Anyone who heard this would be forced to accept it, unless they wanted to spend time and resources digging through the details--which to be honest, none of these pompous young girls were willing or simply unable to go through.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Elder Jhamil’s niece believed Lyla’s family exempt her to excel in foreign language. Yet she was still displeased inside. Her uncle told her that Bhela had been hogging the young noble’s influence for herself, everyone in Malikh Family already knew how Bhela Malikh carrying around the noble young lady yesterday. So what if she had some more bit of talent and had been running around overseas in that whatever seminars she was attending? A bumpkin origin wouldn’t be able to change their bumpkin bloodline. So if Bhela had the right to get close with the Young Lady of Blackwood Family, that meant someone coming from the same family should have the same change as her!</p>\n<p>The elder’s niece said, “Young Lady Bhela, I know the main family is prideful. But Young Lady Blackwood is here to experience the village slow life. Don’t you think she also needs to mingle with us commoners?”</p>\n<p>“Lyla will befriend any person she fancies herself, I don’t control with whom she wants to socialize with,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“If that’s the case, then why she still has no friends other than you?”</p>\n<p>“That’s not true!” Lyla cried indignantly, “I’ve made friends! With aunties! Aunties in the kitchen!”</p>\n<p>It was easy to be friendly with Lyla. She was always unconventional and never saw people by the social system. To her, people only divided by two types, those who gave her food and those who didn’t. She was like a cat. Just bring a good food and she’d be very friendly the next moment.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Lyla’s frank open-mindedness wasn’t easily accepted by some people. Elder Jhamil’s niece gasped as she looked at Lyla and Bhela, back and forth. “My goodness! Young Lady Bhela, were you letting a noble young lady such as Young Lady Blackwood mingle with dirty servants?!”</p>\n<p>“Why wouldn’t I?” Bhela asked back.</p>\n<p>“You--don’t young lady care about our family’s reputation? What if people said we’ve mistreated a noble young lady?”</p>\n<p>“Lyla is here to experience village slow life,” Bhela said slowly, “don’t you think she also needs to mingle with commoners?”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s niece was speechless as Bhela used her own words. The contorted expression on her chaky make-up face brought satisfaction for Lyla, who then snorted.</p>\n<p>“What now? Kitty got your tongue?” Lyla said with her mouth pouted. “So that you know, Sis Bhela already made speechless many many bullies like you! Who were many many many times smarter than you! This is what you get by making fun of me--shame on you, hmph! Who’s the stupid one, now?”</p>\n<p>Even after losing a round of squabble against Young Lady Bhela, unexpectedly the nobly young lady herself became hostile against her. All was so sudden that it made blood drained from her face.</p>\n<p>Bhela ruffled Lyla’s hair. Apparently Lyla still believed these girls came to bully her. When Lyla already made up her mind to not liking someone, it was hard to bend on her opinion.</p>\n<p>“Let’s go, Lyla. We’ll help aunties make sweets for afternoon lunch,” Bhela said. Back in the seminars, when Bhela asked Lyla to do some chores, the supposed noble young lady of Blackwood Family would move slowly, occasionally pouting and murmuring some complaints, unwilling to exert her calories on some boring stuff. However, it was different if the destination was kitchen. The spirit of lively bunny would come to possess her--she’d jolt, sprinting, unwilling to waste time as the promise of free sweets and delicious salty snacks was revealed before her.</p>\n<p>“What was that about?!” one of the le bonjour girls scowled after Bhela and Lyla was gone. “How could a young lady speaks like that?”</p>\n<p>“Bhela must lead her around to act like that! Did you hear what she said? The noble young lady thinks we bully her or something.”</p>\n<p>“Aahhh! What a manipulative bitch! I really want to know what that little cunt said to make Young Lady Blackwood think we had made fun of her. No way in hell someone would dare making fun of a noble like her!”</p>\n<p>Actually, Lyla was made fun of so many times. Especially during her study in the seminars abroad. She made fun of so much that she formed a survival instinct to hide behind Bhela’s back. But they didn’t know that. They just assumed as a young lady coming from a noble family, Lyla Blackwood would be adequately pure noble in stories and gossip. The main reason Bhela brought Lyla away was so that Lyla didn’t have to mingle with these delusional le bonjour girls.</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-4/chapter-1-5":"<p>A fifteen years old boy played a game of chess against a spirit. Yesterday, he won a ghastly old encyclopedia nobody ever heard of. Today, the bet he eyed was silver coins. He didn’t know what he wanted from his opponent for tomorrow’s game. But the spirit in this dashing leather armor, adventurer-style, always wanted one thing for the game’s prize: taking control of the boy’s mortal body.</p>\n<p>More than a hundred games of chess later, the boy still got his healthy body intact, he never lost even once. And that made the spirit grow more dissatisfied as the days passing by.</p>\n<p>“Holy ff--! I clearly remember this damn bishop wasn’t there,” the spirit said. From the look of it, he was two moves away from getting his king owned.</p>\n<p>The boy clicked his tongue. He was hearing that kind of excuse every time the chess game came to its end.</p>\n<p>The spirit stubbornly closed the gap in his defense by sacrificing a rook. But soon, without taking a time to think, the boy casually moved his one horse, eating away the queen, sealing all the chance for the spirit to counter-attack.</p>\n<p>“Fuck this shit!!!”</p>\n<p>Enraged, the spirit flipped the chess board. About a dozen chess pieces hurled all side as they became the victims of the spirit’s frustration. The boy sighed. This was no good. Apparently he needed to be more considerate for the next game. He needed to pretend struggling before he crushed this impatient spirit so he didn’t feel cornered and ended up abandoning all these easy-money making games.</p>\n<p>“Hey,” the boy said. He tapped the flat-surfaced stone they used to lay the chess board before and reminded the spirit, almost as if he was saying “put the money here.”</p>\n<p>As annoyed as he was, the spirit could do nothing but give him a pouch of coins.</p>\n<p>“They are not kobes,” the boy said. “Shops and stalls in the village only accept kobe coins.”</p>\n<p>The spirit scoffed.</p>\n<p>“What do you know about it, brat. If you convert with the last week rate then you’ve got twice the shitty kobe you extort from me. Be glad about it.”</p>\n<p>“This won’t do, Ol’ Nalaq. The peddlers that come around here rarely accept strange currency. Neighbor country’s money is usually fine but I don’t think these coins would do. I don’t even know which country these coins are from.”</p>\n<p>“Then use it to add your savings,” the spirit said. “And don’t call me Nalaq. Don’t push your primitive tribal nonsense to me. Call me ‘Good-Natured Spirit’ as usual. I’m not like your usual Nalaqs, brat.”</p>\n<p>“It’s not tribal.” The boy didn’t show any sign of agreement. He didn’t know why this roguish-grinning spirit didn’t like to be called a Nalaq. The way southern Mossack people, like the boy himself, addressed spirits were usually by two terms: Nalaq and Selaq. As far as he knew Nalaq was a title worth to be proud of.</p>\n<novel-trivia label=”Lore”>\n<p>Nalaq were those of the spirit of fallen heroes and mages, had attained high-level of enlightenment to see ways to preserve souls across death. Whilst no longer to be alive, Nalaqs own their consciousness and retain their memories as well intelligence, though part of their original power diminished, especially those who relied on physical might during their prime.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Selaqs arose from death through unnatural causes, sometimes fueled by resentment and great energy of negativity. Though more powerful, their spirit didn’t dissipate because of strong, usually vile, emotions their harbour when they died, the restless spirits stuck in the limbo and returned back to the mortal world as hostile, mindless haunting spectres.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>Theoretically the spirit that currently playing chess was a Nalaq. He still got his consciousness, true. But, in a way, his intelligence seemed way apart from the Nalaqs southern Mossack tribes often revered in the past--that was what the boy had in mind when looking at this vulgar grinning spirit.</p>\n<p>“You’re not thinking something stupid about me, are you?” the spirit said with a snort as he realized the unexcited eyes the boy had as if he was looking at cow dung.</p>\n<p>“No, I was thinking just the usual--I was wondering about your very existence and your real identity.”</p>\n<p>“That so?” the spirit raised his chin. “Don’t need overthinking it, boy. Hehe. If you know even a piece of my name then you’d be amazed by how amazing I am. Everybody is my bitch when I’m still your age back then, hehe. That’s true.”</p>\n<p>“Hooohhh…” the boy half-heartedly nodded. As expected, every time he brought the topic about the spirit’s identity, all he got was empty talks, disgusting enough for him to regret for bringing up the topic. For now, the only joyous thing he got to do was counting the money he won from the chess game as the bullshit Good-Natured Spirit sang about his past tuning endlessly in the background.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Somewhere in Tiramikal Continent, far in the opposite side of the cold, barbaric northern lands, not too isolated from the bustling early-capitalistic empires of the western lands, and not too far away from the neighbor eastern lands of never-ending warfares between the eastern Kaya feudal lords, a village known as Badril Village was living peaceful for a number of years. The old blood the locals knew as Badril Village’s three big families rooted deeply these past one hundred years in spite of the thinning southern Mossack heritage. Despite slowly developing their rural village worthy of the westerner tourists and easterners refugees, the southern locals still taking pride in their Mossack hunters and gatherers ancestry. Exactly one year ago Good-Natured Spirit appeared in this humble village.󠆞</p>\n<p>On the wall of Yashura Family’s courtyard, which was ridiculously thick and tall for ordinary villages, the spirit took out a rolled paper of dried tobacco. This might not be common knowledge known only to limited people; for converting earthly materials to spiritual goods for Nalaqs to use, it could only be done in an expensive and complicated manner--usually performed in rituals by the royalties and great ancient clans for annual offerings to their ancestors. But the spirit in shabby leather armor did the converting for cigarettes and other trivial goods. Nobody knew how he did it. Even if they did, it’d be very hard to judge whether his quirk was worth to be admired or to be ridiculed at. Nevertheless he got this kind of air around him that telling people he didn’t care much about what they think.</p>\n<p>The street below the wall were children below ages of ten playing with sticks and chasing each other. When a crowd of housewives came, his eyes, sharp as an eagle’s, sweeping through in search of prey. One of his habit that obviously he brought with him since he was alive was to oogle women, especially for young wives and pretty middle-aged aunties interesting big breasts and interesting big butts. Despite his sighing and occasional annoying tongue-clicking, though, those wives and children didn’t turn their heads toward him. They didn’t even know a lecher ghost was there haunting the street. A Nalaq couldn’t be seen by common folks by default. Unless he wanted to, no one would realize there was a suspicious spirit ogling for women that were passing by.</p>\n<p>There was a young woman he knew trotted the street. Good-Natured Spirit knew her. She was neither a wife nor she was an aunty. Her butt and breasts sizes were also not worth being fusing about. The name was Mila Yashura, seventeen years old since last month. She was the older cousin of the boy he lost playing chess to.</p>\n<p>“Aunty,” Mila greeted an aunty by lowering her head, “did you see my cousin Shira around here?”</p>\n<p>The local wife she asked shook her head. Mila Yashura said a polite thanks and continued searching for her cousin.</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit swept the street with his eyes, looking for something. When he saw a certain manservant he stopped. Using his spiritual knife, he dismantled a small pebble from the stone wall he sat on, flicked it using his thumb and knocked the manservant’s head with it.</p>\n<p>“Ouch!” the manservant cried.</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura abruptly turned her head and saw a manservant of her Yashura Family holding his head. She briskly coming to him and asked the same question she threw to the aunty before.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira?” the manservant glanced at the direction of the hill behind Yashura Family’s wall. “I saw him walking there at noon. But whether he has returned or not I don’t know.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you. That’s good enough. Here, treat yourself some coffee beans before the peddlers set for the next village.”</p>\n<p>The hill behind the Yashura Family’s dwelling was originally a place where the family members brought the family’s goats to graze its green grasses. But under the current patriarch’s management, the family’s fortunate mostly put on investing on coconut plantations, thus some grazing places were left unused.</p>\n<p>“Shira! So here’s you holing yourself. I’ve been searching you for nearly an hour,” Mila saw how her cousin who was two years younger than her enjoying himself lying under a shadowy tree, using his arms as pillows. She kicked his foot, yelling him to get up, but Shira merely changed his position and groaned in protest.</p>\n<p>“This buffon…” Mila hissed. “You know how the fact you’re lazing around everyday breeds all those crappy rumors, don’t you?”</p>\n<p>“People can talk whatever they want as long as they don’t bother me,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“But they bother our family!”</p>\n<p>Mila inhaling a deep breath. Now her voice getting higher annoyingly and she continued, “You’re the young master of our family, you lazy pig. The nearest in-line to inherit the patriarch title! You may don’t give a shit about your reputation now but if you are to take the leader's mantle from my father then all the crap they said would certainly bite your ass in the future! You hear?!”</p>\n<p>Shira picked his ear coolly. He might not know anything about the future, but certainly his cousin’s annoying nagging was biting his ass at this moment.</p>\n<p>“What are you doing alone in this kind of place anyway?”</p>\n<p>“You might not believe it, but I’m making a fortune here,” Shira said. Of course, whenever he played a game of chess with a spirit invisible to ordinary humans, he needed a quiet place where nobody was around. This was a perfect place for him.</p>\n<p>But Mila winced her eyes. A few seconds later, she turned her head, catching a canvas filled with rough sketches resting on the tree.</p>\n<p>“By painting?”</p>\n<p>“Sometimes that too.” Shira knew a bit about drawing scenery and people, so even with his limited interpersonal connection as an introvert he could make some money with his painting. However, his casual reply got Mila in a bad mood instead. Suddenly Shira remembered the embarrassing accident two months ago when Mila found an unfinished commision from a certain good-for-nothing spirit that he had carefully hidden in his house. When people commissioned a no-name painter they mostly asked for a portrait or image they deemed interesting. What kind of images Good-Natured Spirit found interesting? Women, of course. Especially those with big butts and big breasts. He liked them in thin, slipping clothings as if those vulnerable ladies were stuck in a very dangerous situation. In other words, erotic paintings.</p>\n<p>Then, sighing at the explosive nagging coming his way, Shira took a stick he slipped on his right ear and presented it as a bribe. Ancient southern Mossacks used berries and some used squid inks as pigments, but after waves of outside influence they started using quills and brushes, depending on the regions. Pencils, although practical, were introduced by a certain Nalaq spirit and Shira hadn’t heard anyone using it beside himself. The stick he used as a bribe was exactly a pencil. It sharpened many times and half-way on its way before he needed another one. Shira thought, maybe he should extort some more pencils for the next match from Good-Natured Spirit.</p>\n<p>Mila furrowed. She knew about the pencil and its value not too long ago thus, as expected, she grabbed it shamelessly. “What? Do you think you can escape only with this?”</p>\n<p>“I planned to give you something else but I think you’d rather like this simple bribe anyway.”</p>\n<p>Shira wanted to simply give her money to make her shut up. But the coins he had on him now only in form of foreign currency--the coins he extorted from Good-Natured Spirit from the last chess game. The boy frowned. Beside nagging him at full force, what did Mila coming here for?</p>\n<p>“Yeah, that reminds me, the news I wanted to tell you!” Mila finally snapped out of her nagging mode. “That Malikh girl! Your fiancée! After two years abroad! She’s finally coming home!”</p>\n<p>“Ohh…” the reply was anticlimactic.</p>\n<p>“Ohh? What the fuck with that reply?”</p>\n<p>“You don’t mind me. I just already burn out when people compare me with her,” Shira said. Although their age were the same, this young lady of Malikh Family was famous even in the nearby villages and town as a talent, with a promising look that might make her a beauty worth dying for. The old generations called her treasure and the boys loved her as the village princess. She went abroad two years ago for a series of seminars after an official from the capital scouted her talent. Now that she returned, everybody was fervently talking about her. But for Shira Yashura, the boy who was supposed to be the fiancé, even that kind of news wasn’t enough to make him get up from his comfortable napping.</p>\n<p>“My father wants to talk with you,” Mila said, “get up now.”</p>\n<p>“What about?”</p>\n<p>“You still asking?”</p>\n<p>The boy had a premonition that a troublesome matter would be waiting for him. Mila gave him an ultimatum before she wandered off to do her own things.</p>\n<p>“Hehe, what’s this fiancée I heard just now?” Good-Natured Spirit popped out his head from a tree beside Shira.</p>\n<p>“It’s not what you think,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“Oh yeah?” Good-Natured Spirit nudged the boy with his elbow. “I heard that chick is a hella beauty. Hehe, I bet her luggages is in good-quality, you know what I mean?”</p>\n<p>“From whom did you hear that?”</p>\n<p>“Doesn’t matter who. When it comes to chick my radar is very sensitive, eh. I’m curious. Did you benefit from this engagement thingy? Benefit, know what I mean?”</p>\n<p>Shira clicked his tongue. “Like I said, it’s not what you think it is. Our parents set us up and it’s been a mess since the talks about engagement got out.”</p>\n<p>Talking some sense to this good-for-nothing Nalaq was futile. Good-Natured Spirit kept teasing him. “You haven’t seen her for two years, have you? The talks I’ve been hearing down there real hairy, brat. I mean… especially those luggages of hers, know what I mean? Know what I mean? Nudge nudge. Nudge nudge,” he winked. “Wanna check on her?”</p>\n<p>“I need to go back. My uncle wants to talk with me.”</p>\n<p>“Alright then,” Good-Natured Spirit nodded as he rubbed his chin. “I’ll check the chick myself.”</p>\n<p>Carrying the canvas and the chess with him, Shira warned the Nalaq, “You better not do anything funny to her, hear me?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho. Jealous?”</p>\n<p>“I just don’t want their entire family coming right after me with pitchforks just because yo do something stupid.”</p>\n<p>After he said that Shira Yashura turned around. He started to walk down the hill. Good-Natured Spirit saw the boy walk without caring for the world, then he set off to check the girl by himself with a chuckle that escaped from his mouth.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A few hours later the said fiancée showed herself in a public training field. The field, owned by the most influential family in Badril Village--the Elzhier Family--was neatly arranged with archery targets and provided with dulled swords for the teenagers trained themselves or doing mock battles. The Elzhiers sent some menservants occasionally to act as security in case conflicts would occur. Today, the young master of the said family himself, nicknamed Bony, guarded the entrance along with two of his lackeys.</p>\n<p>“I’ve got to pay you to enter?!” a young man gawked at the sudden irregularity regarding the training field’s rules. “What’s this? The field is supposed to be free for everyone!”</p>\n<p>“Well, man, gotta pay for maintenance cost,” one of the lackeys, called Pilek, said as he rubbed his nose.</p>\n<p>“One silver kobe! Heh, maintenance cost my ass! Nobody would pay for this bullshit.”</p>\n<p>“Nobody? You wrong, man,” another lackey called Polio pointed at the crowd inside the training field with a gesture of his head. The girl from the Malikh Family causing a big ruckus from her arrival alone. She attracted boys like a bright lamp attracted fireflies. Because of that, the three deliquents in the entrance for nearly half an hour had been amassing quite a fortune till now.</p>\n<p>“I’ll definitely send complaints to Elzhier Family now. Just because your father is the village head you think you can do whatever you want, eh?” the young man snorted, sending a glare to them.</p>\n<p>The Elzhier Family’s young master, who had been watching with his back resting on the wall and his arms crossed, decided to open his mouth, he said, “Pay or get lost.”</p>\n<p>“Hear that? Boss Bony has spoken,” Pilek glared back at the young man with his head tilted. “Better get lost now or else…”</p>\n<p>“Or else!” Polio emphasized with a higher voice.</p>\n<p>The three of them had been infamous in the village despite being heirs to their respective families. Naturally, though they were the same age, only an idiot would butting head directly with the heir of Elzhier Family. Thus the young man snorted, unwillingly turned and walked away.</p>\n<p>“What the heck is that?” Pilek didn’t like the way that young man snorted at them. “We should teach bastards like him a few good lessons one of these days.”</p>\n<p>“You’re right,” Polio added.</p>\n<p>“Just ignore that bum,” Bony said.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, the next onlookers came. Not boys, but two girls to be exact. They carried bags of dirty clothes with them as they were on their way to wash the clothes at the river.</p>\n<p>“Well, I’d be damned,” one of the girls, a young lady named Romana, said, “I’ve been hearing about the rumors but looking at that Malikh girl, damn…. Look at how she did with her hair, Mila.”</p>\n<p>They could see what was happening in the field even from the entrance. The two girls looked at a certain girl who was surrounded by boys. The other girl, Mila Yashura, furrowed her brows at the current appearance of her cousin’s fiancée. She kept her mouth shut despite the anger on her eyes.</p>\n<p>“She cut her hair short despite being engaged to your cousin,” Romana said to Mila. “What’s that supposed to mean?”</p>\n<p>It was a custom of southern Mossack people for women to cut their hair short to tell the opposite sex they currently unavailable. Mostly widows who weren’t ready to be courted again chose to cut their hair that way. However, since the young lady of Malikh Family was currently engaged, the act of cutting her hair short was confusing to people.</p>\n<p>From the three delinquents who had been hearing their conversations, Pilek butted in, “Yo, ladies, don’t think too much about it. We southern people been foreigners with this fiancé-and-fiancée business. We practical people, y’know? Southerners the kind of people who would do it first then talking ‘bout marriage later. A chance she might not know what she was doing.”</p>\n<p>Romana rolled her eyes. Knowing Mila Yashura was here, she wished this stupid cheerful delinquent wouldn’t say what he had said. In fact, better for him to not open his mouth. She hated him whenever he opened his mouth and said pointless things.</p>\n<p>Her and Mila’s goal was to check about the rumor regarding the fiancée’s short hair. They didn’t have the intention to enter the training field and mingle with those crowdy horny boys, lest talking with these shameless thugs who clearly act as bandits.</p>\n<p>“Let’s go, Mila,” Romana whispered as she realized Mila had been glaring at the three delinquents. Moving her eyes from Mila, she looked at Bony who was in between his two lackeys. She whispered again, “you can’t fight him like you used to. He got a Knight class now. People said he can even fight another Knight with four level above him. Let’s just forget about it.”</p>\n<p>Last time Mila and Bony fought was three years ago. Her punch made his nose bleed but that was the end of it. It was a hot topic for a while and most didn’t know what happened but the long enmity between the two of them suddenly dropped cold and they had been avoiding each other. Seeing how the other party was quite well, Mila Yashura grimaced. They were Novices back then but now, after both of them ascended the first level barrier and got themselves class titles, there was no way a support-class Specialist like her could deliver that kind of punch again to his face.</p>\n<p>“Mm. Let’s go,” Mila said to Romana. No matter how brave and reckless she was, as a non-combatant talent, she knew better than to sow another discord with the village’s young generation’s strongest.</p>\n<p>Pilek, the most cheerful in Bony’s group, who was actually the most friendly, waved his hand to the girls as they walked away. Neither of them bothered with him.</p>\n<p>“Ahhh, my sister’s been avoiding me lately,” Pilek grumbled. Romana, Mila’s friend, was actually his half-sister from different mother. He was a proud big brother when they were young, until their mothers had a fight and his half-sister moved into a separate house.</p>\n<p>“Pilek,” Bony called.</p>\n<p>“Yes boss?”</p>\n<p>“You should’ve kept your mouth shut.”</p>\n<p>Pilek wryly smiled and nodded. Polio also thought his friend Pilek couldn’t read between the line. Although Pilek’s remark was well-intentioned, it’d just make things worse for Bony. The bad mood from back three years ago still left after taste that made him and her uncomfortable dealing with each other.</p>\n<p>After that, more people were coming to see the young lady of Malikh Family.</p>\n<p>The talks and speculations about her hair made the boys think she was dissatisfied with her engagement with Shira Yashura. Thus giving them hopes to snatch her away. It was no exaggeration to say that most of the boys fell for her, especially after they saw how the young lady grew beautifully. They surrounded this girl who had this icy expression on her face, though she herself greatly concentrated on holding a bow and an arrow, eyes straight to the archery target dozens of meters from her. She shot. And when the arrow hit splendidly, the boys would cheer and fawn all over her. The girl kept her face cold despite the flooding flattery coming at her way.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” a young man in his early twenty stepped forward from the bunch of admirers and confidently said, “I see you have this different aura about you. Something special that I can’t quite get my fingers on it, and I can’t help but feel curious about you.”</p>\n<p>That was supposed to be a pick-up line, but Bhela Malikh replied straightforwardly, “I changed. Now I’m Level 10 and not a Novice anymore.”</p>\n<p>“Oooohhhh!!” the crowd was surprised. Reaching the first barrier and got a class title at fifteen years old was the second time in these two decades. The first one was Bony. However, considering the girl was quite a talent enough for people in the capital to notice her, there was a high chance for her to snatch the crown as Badril Village’s young generation’s strongest from Bony sooner than everyone expected.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” the young man called for her attention again, despite his first attempt at hitting on her was an utter failure. “I see your beautiful sharp eyes and beautiful nimble hands and your beautiful pretty face. The class you’ve got must be… a beautiful <b>Archer</b>, right?”</p>\n<p>“I am an archer,” Bhela replied tight-lipped. Well, it was obvious when she picked a bow the first thing she arrived here.</p>\n<p>“Ah, a beautiful and talented Archer then! It’s a pity, though for such a fine beautiful flower like yourself to be thrown into a heap of cow dung…”</p>\n<p>The remark made Bhela Malikh raise her brows. She somehow could predict where the topic was going to be directed.</p>\n<p>“That stupid engagement is what I say! How could a diamond such as yourself be forced to marry a trash from Yashura Family?”</p>\n<p>He sighed like he pitied the harsh fate of the beauty. And though unlikeable as he was, the murmurs of the crowd seemingly agreed with him. At that point, someone said, “That’s true. Even my ten years old nephew is one Level above him. Such trash to become…”</p>\n<p>The words stopped, Bhela looked at the person who said that. “The one from Yashura Family--he’s still a Level 3 Novice?”</p>\n<p>It was someone else who replied to her question. “Ah, yes, he’s stuck and made no progress even since Young Lady Bhela went outside the village. Everyone calls him The Eternal Novice.”</p>\n<p>And this made her raised brows turned into a frown. Going by the crowd, for a Level 5 Novice by fifteen years old was already considered slow progress even by the standard of rural places like Badril Village. Mostly at that age the youngsters already reached Level 7, the diligent ones could reach Level 8 with hard work. Faster than that, not counting usage of an unreasonable amount of growth-hack potions--which most children from rich noble families did, could be considered a talent amongst the younger generation. However, to think of a boy one year before his own coming-of-age ceremony coming still stuck at such low-level talent, even though if he was the heir of Badril Village’s major families, people would still call him trash, even in public.</p>\n<p>“Ah, Young Lady Bhela! You don’t have to bother yourself with such eyesore trash. I know you’re troubled with the careless arrangement your father made, but if we put our mind to it, we can--”</p>\n<p>All was well until the young man put bad words about her father. Never did he expect that the girl would mercilessly retract her hand just before the tips of their fingers touched.</p>\n<p>“Please don’t pretend you were familiar with me,” that was what she said.</p>\n<p>The rain of snickers rang all around him. Despite him glaring left and right in an intimidating manner, there was no way for him to suppress the crowd from humiliating him further. At the time he realized the chance for him to court the Young Lady of Malikh Family, the sole daughter of the Malikh Family Patriarch, was pitifully close to nothing. Thus, in a moment of spontaneity, he thought of a scheme to save his face and sounded it with a flash of desperate smirk plastered on his face. He grabbed a bow and said, “I see Young Lady Bhela rather reserved toward us long friends after two years abroad. Hmm, yeah, this is a perfect chance, by the way. I’m an Archer too, see. So why not this senior teach you a thing or two? Seventy meters--perhaps a good learning experience for young lady, no?”</p>\n<p>The surrounding began chattering lively. It was obvious it was a challenge as Archers. And the young man’s smirk turned more and more confident at the girl’s unresponsiveness. No matter how much potential talent one had, time and experience playing a vital role in assessing one’s current performance whether she was Archer or Priest or Knight or other classes. Skills, abilities one acquired after reaching the first barrier and getting a new class title could only progress with constant tempering in battle and improved alongside one’s level. The young man was a Level 12 Archer. So theoretically, a Level 10 new Archer like Bhela Malikh would need a few more years before she could beat the opponent in a fair competition.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh was annoyed. She glared at the ones who were supposed to be guarding the field. But Bony and his lackeys were busy counting coins. For Bhela, the crowd were a bunch of stupid annoying busybodies who prevented her to train in peace. But for Bony and his lackeys the crowd was simply a bunch of gold mines.</p>\n<p>“Please watch closely how I do it, Young Lady Bhela. See my elbow? If you could do the same way I do it, I’m sure your archery skill would improve significantly.”</p>\n<p>No one really bothered with the ‘humble direction’ the young man spouted. Bhela didn’t spare him a glance. She looked straight to target seventy meters from where she was standing. Repressing his anger, the young man began to shoot three arrows one by one splendidly; the final one landed right in the center of the target that was marked in red dot.</p>\n<p>He was satisfied with the result. Glancing at the young lady, this young man wanted to utter more words to improve his image. However, right before he opened his mouth, he found Bhela already drew her arrow, released it, and it hit one arrow splendidly. Not just hitting the target, but an arrow the young man previously shot. The second was the same. And the final third arrow also hit the arrow on the red dot.</p>\n<p>What was that? She used a skill? The young man wanted to object but his tongue froze and his lips quivered. Did she use <b>Far Sight</b> skill that enhanced eye-sight a hundred of meters away? Did she use <b>Boost Accuracy</b>, the skill that was supposedly forbidden to be used in duel between Archers? To think of beating him, an Archer older than her and 2 Level right above her, in such a devastating manner… she must be cheating, right?</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” the defeated young man said weakly, “I didn’t use my mana between my shots.”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh nodded.</p>\n<p>“Neither was I.”</p>\n<p>With that, Bhela turned around and left the crowd of dumbfounded boys with steps full of grace. She approached the entrance, returned back the bow she used to the three delinquents who just let people mess with her training and said coldly, “If this is how the famous Young Master Elzhier manages his property, then there’s no need for me to come here again. Please excuse me.”</p>\n<p>Bony’s expression didn’t change much as he still crossed his arms and rested his back casually on the wall.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Pilek, the one received the returned bow from Bhela, waved his hand again and shouted, “Take care, princess!”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Because she couldn’t train her archery peacefully in public, Bhela returned back to Malikh Family and trained in her private training place.</p>\n<p>It was originally a backyard turned archery ground, made by Malikh Family Patriarch after knowing his daughter showed interest in archery. It was nothing fancy. It was spacious and good enough when she started with her first bow but now Bhela felt the place was lacking. At most, she had to live with the meager fifty meters range maximum. Therefore, the practice she had made a habit of had to wait.</p>\n<p>Therefore, Bhela Malikh decided to put her mind over something else than her usual practice instead.</p>\n<p>She drew a deep breath. A table was provided with dozens of arrows laid on top of it. Bhela picked four at the same time, nocked them on her bow string. She began to aim.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the air surrounding her changed. Her inexperience as a newly Novice-graduate showed by the obvious mana that leaked from the inside out. With naked eyes, her mana looked calm colorful haze that consisted of four bold colors, tangling and struggling with each other for dominance. Her eyelashes quivered. Channeling mana to cast a skill she yet had mastered felt like trying to stand on the raging sea waves while she herself was being a weak newborn.</p>\n<p><em>Whhhhuuuuushh--</em></p>\n<p><em>Shuuuhsh--</em></p>\n<p><em>Ssshhhuuuush--</em></p>\n<p><em>Wwhuuuussh!!</em></p>\n<p>The fastest arrow, coated with sparking yellow-colored mana, hit one of the targets at around forty meters range. But the others performed pitifully. The one infused with wet blue-colored mana didn’t even reach two-third of the desired range. The green-colored one, an arrow infused with mana that generated unstable wind trajectory flew far far away, as if it was getting swallowed by the sky, never to be seen again. The last one, the red-colored arrow, was horrifying. It hit the training ground fence instead the target. The bamboo fences suddenly set ablaze by raging flames as soon as the said arrow came into contact with them.</p>\n<p><em>Clap clap clap!</em></p>\n<p>Uninvited claps resounded across the training ground. On the wall Good-Natured Spirit clapping after watching a good spectacle. For getting hand claps from a Nalaq like him, naturally the level of talent Bhela showed just now was far beyond ordinary.</p>\n<p>“Thank you…” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>It appeared she knew beforehand the four-arrows skill she shot would make a mess. So she gathered the maidservants and made them extinguish the fences that started to burn into ashes. “Thank you, thank you for your hard work,” she said to a pair of maidservants who briskly went back and forth to kill the fire before its spread.</p>\n<p>“Ah! Young lady, what skill was that just now?” one of the maidservants gawked after the fire was extinguished.</p>\n<p>“That wasn’t just your ordinary Archer skill, was it?” added the other.</p>\n<p>Summoning a blazing fire just with an arrow and pure mana was unheard of. At least, the maidservants knew nobody in the village could do that.</p>\n<p>Bhela drank a glass of murky liquify herbs mixed with mint to cool down her manasphere. “It’s something I learned when I was away,” she said after putting down the glass on the tray her maid servants provided. She continued, “I still can’t master it, though.”</p>\n<p>She cast her eyes at the unharmed targets one by one. Shooting at forty meters range was still too much for her using four arrows at the same time. When the maidservants realized her difficulty, they encouraged her to simplify it and shoot one arrow at a time. However at their suggestion, Bhela shook her head. “It’s the requirement of this skill I’ve got to shoot four arrows,” she explained.</p>\n<p>The maidservants nodded at her words and apologized for their shallow suggestion.</p>\n<p>“Don’t mind that,” Bhela waved her hand. “There’s something I heard from people, by the way. Something about Young Master Yashura.”</p>\n<p>The two maidservants glanced at each other before one of them replied. “The rumor says… he holed up from the public’s view because he’s ashamed he can’t even become a Level 4 Novice.”</p>\n<p>“Are the Yashura Family elders still favoring him as the heir of Yashura Family Patriarch?”</p>\n<p>“We don’t know whether they still favor him or not. But Yashura Family always united in their standing. So unless the current Patriarch of Yashura Family has a son, the Young Master Shira Yashura will undoubtedly become the next patriarch.”</p>\n<p>“No rumors about the Yashura Family elders wavering then?”</p>\n<p>The maidservants shook their heads altogether.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela… apologize for giving you my shallow suggestion once again but…” one of the maidservants came near to Bhela and whispered, “With him as the heir, Yashura Family’s future will be bleak. Everyone in our family said your father’s bad condition is a bad omen for us mingling with those simple Yashuras. I’m very sorry if this sounds impudent--but you should’ve better cut ties with them before too late, young lady. Madam was too grieved by your father’s ill health to make decisions thus the only one who can save our Malikh Family is you.”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at the maidservant. The glint on her eyes changed.</p>\n<p>“There’s already a plan laid to help our Malikh Family,” that was all Bhela said. “You better not say something like that again. You lucky no one here beside me to hear you utter that kind of words.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you for your mercy, young lady! We are sorry for being impudent!”</p>\n<p>They decided to make it history with only the four of them who knew the previous conversation. The four of them; the young lady and two maid servants and one Nalaq spirit who came here uninvited.</p>\n<p>“It seems I just heard something I shouldn’t hear,” Good-Natured Spirit said while he rubbed his chin. He came here peeking. He didn’t have the intention to reveal himself while the girls below had a secret conversation ignorant of his presence.</p>\n<p>After that Bhela continued with light training. Good-Natured Spirit watched her doing simple shooting, she didn’t even use a slightest of her mana from then on. Yawning, Good-Natured Spirit stood up. Then he flew away from Malikh Family and began to look for some other interesting thing to sate his boredom.</p>\n<hr>\n<authors-note id=\"Radhy\">\n<p>Testing, testing.

Yesterday, he won a ghastly old encyclopedia nobody ever heard of. Today, the bet he eyed was silver coins. He didn’t know what he wanted from his opponent for tomorrow’s game. But the spirit in this dashing leather armor, adventurer-style, always wanted one thing for the game’s prize: taking control of the boy’s mortal body.</p>\n<p>More than a hundred games of chess later, the boy still got his healthy body intact, he never lost even once. And that made the spirit grow more dissatisfied as the days passing by.</p>\n<p>“Holy ff--! I clearly remember this damn bishop wasn’t there,” the spirit said. From the look of it, he was two moves away from getting his king owned.</p>\n<p>The boy clicked his tongue. He was hearing that kind of excuse every time the chess game came to its end.</p>\n<p>The spirit stubbornly closed the gap in his defense by sacrificing a rook. But soon, without taking a time to think, the boy casually moved his one horse, eating away the queen, sealing all the chance for the spirit to counter-attack.</p>\n<p>“Fuck this shit!!!”</p>\n<p>Enraged, the spirit flipped the chess board. About a dozen chess pieces hurled all side as they became the victims of the spirit’s frustration. The boy sighed. This was no good. Apparently he needed to be more considerate for the next game. He needed to pretend struggling before he crushed this impatient spirit so he didn’t feel cornered and ended up abandoning all these easy-money making games.</p>\n<p>“Hey,” the boy said. He tapped the flat-surfaced stone they used to lay the chess board before and reminded the spirit, almost as if he was saying “put the money here.”</p>\n<p>As annoyed as he was, the spirit could do nothing but give him a pouch of coins.</p>\n<p>“They are not kobes,” the boy said. “Shops and stalls in the village only accept kobe coins.”</p>\n<p>The spirit scoffed.</p>\n<p>“What do you know about it, brat. If you convert with the last week rate then you’ve got twice the shitty kobe you extort from me. Be glad about it.”</p>\n<p>“This won’t do, Ol’ Nalaq. The peddlers that come around here rarely accept strange currency. Neighbor country’s money is usually fine but I don’t think these coins would do. I don’t even know which country these coins are from.”</p>\n<p>“Then use it to add your savings,” the spirit said. “And don’t call me Nalaq. Don’t push your primitive tribal nonsense to me. Call me ‘Good-Natured Spirit’ as usual. I’m not like your usual Nalaqs, brat.”</p>\n<p>“It’s not tribal.” The boy didn’t show any sign of agreement. He didn’t know why this roguish-grinning spirit didn’t like to be called a Nalaq. The way southern Mossack people, like the boy himself, addressed spirits were usually by two terms: Nalaq and Selaq. As far as he knew Nalaq was a title worth to be proud of.</p>\n<novel-trivia label=”Lore”>\n<p>Nalaq were those of the spirit of fallen heroes and mages, had attained high-level of enlightenment to see ways to preserve souls across death. Whilst no longer to be alive, Nalaqs own their consciousness and retain their memories as well intelligence, though part of their original power diminished, especially those who relied on physical might during their prime.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Selaqs arose from death through unnatural causes, sometimes fueled by resentment and great energy of negativity. Though more powerful, their spirit didn’t dissipate because of strong, usually vile, emotions their harbour when they died, the restless spirits stuck in the limbo and returned back to the mortal world as hostile, mindless haunting spectres.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>Theoretically the spirit that currently playing chess was a Nalaq. He still got his consciousness, true. But, in a way, his intelligence seemed way apart from the Nalaqs southern Mossack tribes often revered in the past--that was what the boy had in mind when looking at this vulgar grinning spirit.</p>\n<p>“You’re not thinking something stupid about me, are you?” the spirit said with a snort as he realized the unexcited eyes the boy had as if he was looking at cow dung.</p>\n<p>“No, I was thinking just the usual--I was wondering about your very existence and your real identity.”</p>\n<p>“That so?” the spirit raised his chin. “Don’t need overthinking it, boy. Hehe. If you know even a piece of my name then you’d be amazed by how amazing I am. Everybody is my bitch when I’m still your age back then, hehe. That’s true.”</p>\n<p>“Hooohhh…” the boy half-heartedly nodded. As expected, every time he brought the topic about the spirit’s identity, all he got was empty talks, disgusting enough for him to regret for bringing up the topic. For now, the only joyous thing he got to do was counting the money he won from the chess game as the bullshit Good-Natured Spirit sang about his past tuning endlessly in the background.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Somewhere in Tiramikal Continent, far in the opposite side of the cold, barbaric northern lands, not too isolated from the bustling early-capitalistic empires of the western lands, and not too far away from the neighbor eastern lands of never-ending warfares between the eastern Kaya feudal lords, a village known as Badril Village was living peaceful for a number of years. The old blood the locals knew as Badril Village’s three big families rooted deeply these past one hundred years in spite of the thinning southern Mossack heritage. Despite slowly developing their rural village worthy of the westerner tourists and easterners refugees, the southern locals still taking pride in their Mossack hunters and gatherers ancestry. Exactly one year ago Good-Natured Spirit appeared in this humble village.󠆞</p>\n<p>On the wall of Yashura Family’s courtyard, which was ridiculously thick and tall for ordinary villages, the spirit took out a rolled paper of dried tobacco. This might not be common knowledge known only to limited people; for converting earthly materials to spiritual goods for Nalaqs to use, it could only be done in an expensive and complicated manner--usually performed in rituals by the royalties and great ancient clans for annual offerings to their ancestors. But the spirit in shabby leather armor did the converting for cigarettes and other trivial goods. Nobody knew how he did it. Even if they did, it’d be very hard to judge whether his quirk was worth to be admired or to be ridiculed at. Nevertheless he got this kind of air around him that telling people he didn’t care much about what they think.</p>\n<p>The street below the wall were children below ages of ten playing with sticks and chasing each other. When a crowd of housewives came, his eyes, sharp as an eagle’s, sweeping through in search of prey. One of his habit that obviously he brought with him since he was alive was to oogle women, especially for young wives and pretty middle-aged aunties interesting big breasts and interesting big butts. Despite his sighing and occasional annoying tongue-clicking, though, those wives and children didn’t turn their heads toward him. They didn’t even know a lecher ghost was there haunting the street. A Nalaq couldn’t be seen by common folks by default. Unless he wanted to, no one would realize there was a suspicious spirit ogling for women that were passing by.</p>\n<p>There was a young woman he knew trotted the street. Good-Natured Spirit knew her. She was neither a wife nor she was an aunty. Her butt and breasts sizes were also not worth being fusing about. The name was Mila Yashura, seventeen years old since last month. She was the older cousin of the boy he lost playing chess to.</p>\n<p>“Aunty,” Mila greeted an aunty by lowering her head, “did you see my cousin Shira around here?”</p>\n<p>The local wife she asked shook her head. Mila Yashura said a polite thanks and continued searching for her cousin.</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit swept the street with his eyes, looking for something. When he saw a certain manservant he stopped. Using his spiritual knife, he dismantled a small pebble from the stone wall he sat on, flicked it using his thumb and knocked the manservant’s head with it.</p>\n<p>“Ouch!” the manservant cried.</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura abruptly turned her head and saw a manservant of her Yashura Family holding his head. She briskly coming to him and asked the same question she threw to the aunty before.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira?” the manservant glanced at the direction of the hill behind Yashura Family’s wall. “I saw him walking there at noon. But whether he has returned or not I don’t know.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you. That’s good enough. Here, treat yourself some coffee beans before the peddlers set for the next village.”</p>\n<p>The hill behind the Yashura Family’s dwelling was originally a place where the family members brought the family’s goats to graze its green grasses. But under the current patriarch’s management, the family’s fortunate mostly put on investing on coconut plantations, thus some grazing places were left unused.</p>\n<p>“Shira! So here’s you holing yourself. I’ve been searching you for nearly an hour,” Mila saw how her cousin who was two years younger than her enjoying himself lying under a shadowy tree, using his arms as pillows. She kicked his foot, yelling him to get up, but Shira merely changed his position and groaned in protest.</p>\n<p>“This buffon…” Mila hissed. “You know how the fact you’re lazing around everyday breeds all those crappy rumors, don’t you?”</p>\n<p>“People can talk whatever they want as long as they don’t bother me,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“But they bother our family!”</p>\n<p>Mila inhaling a deep breath. Now her voice getting higher annoyingly and she continued, “You’re the young master of our family, you lazy pig. The nearest in-line to inherit the patriarch title! You may don’t give a shit about your reputation now but if you are to take the leader's mantle from my father then all the crap they said would certainly bite your ass in the future! You hear?!”</p>\n<p>Shira picked his ear coolly. He might not know anything about the future, but certainly his cousin’s annoying nagging was biting his ass at this moment.</p>\n<p>“What are you doing alone in this kind of place anyway?”</p>\n<p>“You might not believe it, but I’m making a fortune here,” Shira said. Of course, whenever he played a game of chess with a spirit invisible to ordinary humans, he needed a quiet place where nobody was around. This was a perfect place for him.</p>\n<p>But Mila winced her eyes. A few seconds later, she turned her head, catching a canvas filled with rough sketches resting on the tree.</p>\n<p>“By painting?”</p>\n<p>“Sometimes that too.” Shira knew a bit about drawing scenery and people, so even with his limited interpersonal connection as an introvert he could make some money with his painting. However, his casual reply got Mila in a bad mood instead. Suddenly Shira remembered the embarrassing accident two months ago when Mila found an unfinished commision from a certain good-for-nothing spirit that he had carefully hidden in his house. When people commissioned a no-name painter they mostly asked for a portrait or image they deemed interesting. What kind of images Good-Natured Spirit found interesting? Women, of course. Especially those with big butts and big breasts. He liked them in thin, slipping clothings as if those vulnerable ladies were stuck in a very dangerous situation. In other words, erotic paintings.</p>\n<p>Then, sighing at the explosive nagging coming his way, Shira took a stick he slipped on his right ear and presented it as a bribe. Ancient southern Mossacks used berries and some used squid inks as pigments, but after waves of outside influence they started using quills and brushes, depending on the regions. Pencils, although practical, were introduced by a certain Nalaq spirit and Shira hadn’t heard anyone using it beside himself. The stick he used as a bribe was exactly a pencil. It sharpened many times and half-way on its way before he needed another one. Shira thought, maybe he should extort some more pencils for the next match from Good-Natured Spirit.</p>\n<p>Mila furrowed. She knew about the pencil and its value not too long ago thus, as expected, she grabbed it shamelessly. “What? Do you think you can escape only with this?”</p>\n<p>“I planned to give you something else but I think you’d rather like this simple bribe anyway.”</p>\n<p>Shira wanted to simply give her money to make her shut up. But the coins he had on him now only in form of foreign currency--the coins he extorted from Good-Natured Spirit from the last chess game. The boy frowned. Beside nagging him at full force, what did Mila coming here for?</p>\n<p>“Yeah, that reminds me, the news I wanted to tell you!” Mila finally snapped out of her nagging mode. “That Malikh girl! Your fiancée! After two years abroad! She’s finally coming home!”</p>\n<p>“Ohh…” the reply was anticlimactic.</p>\n<p>“Ohh? What the fuck with that reply?”</p>\n<p>“You don’t mind me. I just already burn out when people compare me with her,” Shira said. Although their age were the same, this young lady of Malikh Family was famous even in the nearby villages and town as a talent, with a promising look that might make her a beauty worth dying for. The old generations called her treasure and the boys loved her as the village princess. She went abroad two years ago for a series of seminars after an official from the capital scouted her talent. Now that she returned, everybody was fervently talking about her. But for Shira Yashura, the boy who was supposed to be the fiancé, even that kind of news wasn’t enough to make him get up from his comfortable napping.</p>\n<p>“My father wants to talk with you,” Mila said, “get up now.”</p>\n<p>“What about?”</p>\n<p>“You still asking?”</p>\n<p>The boy had a premonition that a troublesome matter would be waiting for him. Mila gave him an ultimatum before she wandered off to do her own things.</p>\n<p>“Hehe, what’s this fiancée I heard just now?” Good-Natured Spirit popped out his head from a tree beside Shira.</p>\n<p>“It’s not what you think,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“Oh yeah?” Good-Natured Spirit nudged the boy with his elbow. “I heard that chick is a hella beauty. Hehe, I bet her luggages is in good-quality, you know what I mean?”</p>\n<p>“From whom did you hear that?”</p>\n<p>“Doesn’t matter who. When it comes to chick my radar is very sensitive, eh. I’m curious. Did you benefit from this engagement thingy? Benefit, know what I mean?”</p>\n<p>Shira clicked his tongue. “Like I said, it’s not what you think it is. Our parents set us up and it’s been a mess since the talks about engagement got out.”</p>\n<p>Talking some sense to this good-for-nothing Nalaq was futile. Good-Natured Spirit kept teasing him. “You haven’t seen her for two years, have you? The talks I’ve been hearing down there real hairy, brat. I mean… especially those luggages of hers, know what I mean? Know what I mean? Nudge nudge. Nudge nudge,” he winked. “Wanna check on her?”</p>\n<p>“I need to go back. My uncle wants to talk with me.”</p>\n<p>“Alright then,” Good-Natured Spirit nodded as he rubbed his chin. “I’ll check the chick myself.”</p>\n<p>Carrying the canvas and the chess with him, Shira warned the Nalaq, “You better not do anything funny to her, hear me?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho. Jealous?”</p>\n<p>“I just don’t want their entire family coming right after me with pitchforks just because yo do something stupid.”</p>\n<p>After he said that Shira Yashura turned around. He started to walk down the hill. Good-Natured Spirit saw the boy walk without caring for the world, then he set off to check the girl by himself with a chuckle that escaped from his mouth.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A few hours later the said fiancée showed herself in a public training field. The field, owned by the most influential family in Badril Village--the Elzhier Family--was neatly arranged with archery targets and provided with dulled swords for the teenagers trained themselves or doing mock battles. The Elzhiers sent some menservants occasionally to act as security in case conflicts would occur. Today, the young master of the said family himself, nicknamed Bony, guarded the entrance along with two of his lackeys.</p>\n<p>“I’ve got to pay you to enter?!” a young man gawked at the sudden irregularity regarding the training field’s rules. “What’s this? The field is supposed to be free for everyone!”</p>\n<p>“Well, man, gotta pay for maintenance cost,” one of the lackeys, called Pilek, said as he rubbed his nose.</p>\n<p>“One silver kobe! Heh, maintenance cost my ass! Nobody would pay for this bullshit.”</p>\n<p>“Nobody? You wrong, man,” another lackey called Polio pointed at the crowd inside the training field with a gesture of his head. The girl from the Malikh Family causing a big ruckus from her arrival alone. She attracted boys like a bright lamp attracted fireflies. Because of that, the three deliquents in the entrance for nearly half an hour had been amassing quite a fortune till now.</p>\n<p>“I’ll definitely send complaints to Elzhier Family now. Just because your father is the village head you think you can do whatever you want, eh?” the young man snorted, sending a glare to them.</p>\n<p>The Elzhier Family’s young master, who had been watching with his back resting on the wall and his arms crossed, decided to open his mouth, he said, “Pay or get lost.”</p>\n<p>“Hear that? Boss Bony has spoken,” Pilek glared back at the young man with his head tilted. “Better get lost now or else…”</p>\n<p>“Or else!” Polio emphasized with a higher voice.</p>\n<p>The three of them had been infamous in the village despite being heirs to their respective families. Naturally, though they were the same age, only an idiot would butting head directly with the heir of Elzhier Family. Thus the young man snorted, unwillingly turned and walked away.</p>\n<p>“What the heck is that?” Pilek didn’t like the way that young man snorted at them. “We should teach bastards like him a few good lessons one of these days.”</p>\n<p>“You’re right,” Polio added.</p>\n<p>“Just ignore that bum,” Bony said.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, the next onlookers came. Not boys, but two girls to be exact. They carried bags of dirty clothes with them as they were on their way to wash the clothes at the river.</p>\n<p>“Well, I’d be damned,” one of the girls, a young lady named Romana, said, “I’ve been hearing about the rumors but looking at that Malikh girl, damn…. Look at how she did with her hair, Mila.”</p>\n<p>They could see what was happening in the field even from the entrance. The two girls looked at a certain girl who was surrounded by boys. The other girl, Mila Yashura, furrowed her brows at the current appearance of her cousin’s fiancée. She kept her mouth shut despite the anger on her eyes.</p>\n<p>“She cut her hair short despite being engaged to your cousin,” Romana said to Mila. “What’s that supposed to mean?”</p>\n<p>It was a custom of southern Mossack people for women to cut their hair short to tell the opposite sex they currently unavailable. Mostly widows who weren’t ready to be courted again chose to cut their hair that way. However, since the young lady of Malikh Family was currently engaged, the act of cutting her hair short was confusing to people.</p>\n<p>From the three delinquents who had been hearing their conversations, Pilek butted in, “Yo, ladies, don’t think too much about it. We southern people been foreigners with this fiancé-and-fiancée business. We practical people, y’know? Southerners the kind of people who would do it first then talking ‘bout marriage later. A chance she might not know what she was doing.”</p>\n<p>Romana rolled her eyes. Knowing Mila Yashura was here, she wished this stupid cheerful delinquent wouldn’t say what he had said. In fact, better for him to not open his mouth. She hated him whenever he opened his mouth and said pointless things.</p>\n<p>Her and Mila’s goal was to check about the rumor regarding the fiancée’s short hair. They didn’t have the intention to enter the training field and mingle with those crowdy horny boys, lest talking with these shameless thugs who clearly act as bandits.</p>\n<p>“Let’s go, Mila,” Romana whispered as she realized Mila had been glaring at the three delinquents. Moving her eyes from Mila, she looked at Bony who was in between his two lackeys. She whispered again, “you can’t fight him like you used to. He got a Knight class now. People said he can even fight another Knight with four level above him. Let’s just forget about it.”</p>\n<p>Last time Mila and Bony fought was three years ago. Her punch made his nose bleed but that was the end of it. It was a hot topic for a while and most didn’t know what happened but the long enmity between the two of them suddenly dropped cold and they had been avoiding each other. Seeing how the other party was quite well, Mila Yashura grimaced. They were Novices back then but now, after both of them ascended the first level barrier and got themselves class titles, there was no way a support-class Specialist like her could deliver that kind of punch again to his face.</p>\n<p>“Mm. Let’s go,” Mila said to Romana. No matter how brave and reckless she was, as a non-combatant talent, she knew better than to sow another discord with the village’s young generation’s strongest.</p>\n<p>Pilek, the most cheerful in Bony’s group, who was actually the most friendly, waved his hand to the girls as they walked away. Neither of them bothered with him.</p>\n<p>“Ahhh, my sister’s been avoiding me lately,” Pilek grumbled. Romana, Mila’s friend, was actually his half-sister from different mother. He was a proud big brother when they were young, until their mothers had a fight and his half-sister moved into a separate house.</p>\n<p>“Pilek,” Bony called.</p>\n<p>“Yes boss?”</p>\n<p>“You should’ve kept your mouth shut.”</p>\n<p>Pilek wryly smiled and nodded. Polio also thought his friend Pilek couldn’t read between the line. Although Pilek’s remark was well-intentioned, it’d just make things worse for Bony. The bad mood from back three years ago still left after taste that made him and her uncomfortable dealing with each other.</p>\n<p>After that, more people were coming to see the young lady of Malikh Family.</p>\n<p>The talks and speculations about her hair made the boys think she was dissatisfied with her engagement with Shira Yashura. Thus giving them hopes to snatch her away. It was no exaggeration to say that most of the boys fell for her, especially after they saw how the young lady grew beautifully. They surrounded this girl who had this icy expression on her face, though she herself greatly concentrated on holding a bow and an arrow, eyes straight to the archery target dozens of meters from her. She shot. And when the arrow hit splendidly, the boys would cheer and fawn all over her. The girl kept her face cold despite the flooding flattery coming at her way.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” a young man in his early twenty stepped forward from the bunch of admirers and confidently said, “I see you have this different aura about you. Something special that I can’t quite get my fingers on it, and I can’t help but feel curious about you.”</p>\n<p>That was supposed to be a pick-up line, but Bhela Malikh replied straightforwardly, “I changed. Now I’m Level 10 and not a Novice anymore.”</p>\n<p>“Oooohhhh!!” the crowd was surprised. Reaching the first barrier and got a class title at fifteen years old was the second time in these two decades. The first one was Bony. However, considering the girl was quite a talent enough for people in the capital to notice her, there was a high chance for her to snatch the crown as Badril Village’s young generation’s strongest from Bony sooner than everyone expected.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” the young man called for her attention again, despite his first attempt at hitting on her was an utter failure. “I see your beautiful sharp eyes and beautiful nimble hands and your beautiful pretty face. The class you’ve got must be… a beautiful <b>Archer</b>, right?”</p>\n<p>“I am an archer,” Bhela replied tight-lipped. Well, it was obvious when she picked a bow the first thing she arrived here.</p>\n<p>“Ah, a beautiful and talented Archer then! It’s a pity, though for such a fine beautiful flower like yourself to be thrown into a heap of cow dung…”</p>\n<p>The remark made Bhela Malikh raise her brows. She somehow could predict where the topic was going to be directed.</p>\n<p>“That stupid engagement is what I say! How could a diamond such as yourself be forced to marry a trash from Yashura Family?”</p>\n<p>He sighed like he pitied the harsh fate of the beauty. And though unlikeable as he was, the murmurs of the crowd seemingly agreed with him. At that point, someone said, “That’s true. Even my ten years old nephew is one Level above him. Such trash to become…”</p>\n<p>The words stopped, Bhela looked at the person who said that. “The one from Yashura Family--he’s still a Level 3 Novice?”</p>\n<p>It was someone else who replied to her question. “Ah, yes, he’s stuck and made no progress even since Young Lady Bhela went outside the village. Everyone calls him The Eternal Novice.”</p>\n<p>And this made her raised brows turned into a frown. Going by the crowd, for a Level 5 Novice by fifteen years old was already considered slow progress even by the standard of rural places like Badril Village. Mostly at that age the youngsters already reached Level 7, the diligent ones could reach Level 8 with hard work. Faster than that, not counting usage of an unreasonable amount of growth-hack potions--which most children from rich noble families did, could be considered a talent amongst the younger generation. However, to think of a boy one year before his own coming-of-age ceremony coming still stuck at such low-level talent, even though if he was the heir of Badril Village’s major families, people would still call him trash, even in public.</p>\n<p>“Ah, Young Lady Bhela! You don’t have to bother yourself with such eyesore trash. I know you’re troubled with the careless arrangement your father made, but if we put our mind to it, we can--”</p>\n<p>All was well until the young man put bad words about her father. Never did he expect that the girl would mercilessly retract her hand just before the tips of their fingers touched.</p>\n<p>“Please don’t pretend you were familiar with me,” that was what she said.</p>\n<p>The rain of snickers rang all around him. Despite him glaring left and right in an intimidating manner, there was no way for him to suppress the crowd from humiliating him further. At the time he realized the chance for him to court the Young Lady of Malikh Family, the sole daughter of the Malikh Family Patriarch, was pitifully close to nothing. Thus, in a moment of spontaneity, he thought of a scheme to save his face and sounded it with a flash of desperate smirk plastered on his face. He grabbed a bow and said, “I see Young Lady Bhela rather reserved toward us long friends after two years abroad. Hmm, yeah, this is a perfect chance, by the way. I’m an Archer too, see. So why not this senior teach you a thing or two? Seventy meters--perhaps a good learning experience for young lady, no?”</p>\n<p>The surrounding began chattering lively. It was obvious it was a challenge as Archers. And the young man’s smirk turned more and more confident at the girl’s unresponsiveness. No matter how much potential talent one had, time and experience playing a vital role in assessing one’s current performance whether she was Archer or Priest or Knight or other classes. Skills, abilities one acquired after reaching the first barrier and getting a new class title could only progress with constant tempering in battle and improved alongside one’s level. The young man was a Level 12 Archer. So theoretically, a Level 10 new Archer like Bhela Malikh would need a few more years before she could beat the opponent in a fair competition.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh was annoyed. She glared at the ones who were supposed to be guarding the field. But Bony and his lackeys were busy counting coins. For Bhela, the crowd were a bunch of stupid annoying busybodies who prevented her to train in peace. But for Bony and his lackeys the crowd was simply a bunch of gold mines.</p>\n<p>“Please watch closely how I do it, Young Lady Bhela. See my elbow? If you could do the same way I do it, I’m sure your archery skill would improve significantly.”</p>\n<p>No one really bothered with the ‘humble direction’ the young man spouted. Bhela didn’t spare him a glance. She looked straight to target seventy meters from where she was standing. Repressing his anger, the young man began to shoot three arrows one by one splendidly; the final one landed right in the center of the target that was marked in red dot.</p>\n<p>He was satisfied with the result. Glancing at the young lady, this young man wanted to utter more words to improve his image. However, right before he opened his mouth, he found Bhela already drew her arrow, released it, and it hit one arrow splendidly. Not just hitting the target, but an arrow the young man previously shot. The second was the same. And the final third arrow also hit the arrow on the red dot.</p>\n<p>What was that? She used a skill? The young man wanted to object but his tongue froze and his lips quivered. Did she use <b>Far Sight</b> skill that enhanced eye-sight a hundred of meters away? Did she use <b>Boost Accuracy</b>, the skill that was supposedly forbidden to be used in duel between Archers? To think of beating him, an Archer older than her and 2 Level right above her, in such a devastating manner… she must be cheating, right?</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” the defeated young man said weakly, “I didn’t use my mana between my shots.”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh nodded.</p>\n<p>“Neither was I.”</p>\n<p>With that, Bhela turned around and left the crowd of dumbfounded boys with steps full of grace. She approached the entrance, returned back the bow she used to the three delinquents who just let people mess with her training and said coldly, “If this is how the famous Young Master Elzhier manages his property, then there’s no need for me to come here again. Please excuse me.”</p>\n<p>Bony’s expression didn’t change much as he still crossed his arms and rested his back casually on the wall.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Pilek, the one received the returned bow from Bhela, waved his hand again and shouted, “Take care, princess!”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Because she couldn’t train her archery peacefully in public, Bhela returned back to Malikh Family and trained in her private training place.</p>\n<p>It was originally a backyard turned archery ground, made by Malikh Family Patriarch after knowing his daughter showed interest in archery. It was nothing fancy. It was spacious and good enough when she started with her first bow but now Bhela felt the place was lacking. At most, she had to live with the meager fifty meters range maximum. Therefore, the practice she had made a habit of had to wait.</p>\n<p>Therefore, Bhela Malikh decided to put her mind over something else than her usual practice instead.</p>\n<p>She drew a deep breath. A table was provided with dozens of arrows laid on top of it. Bhela picked four at the same time, nocked them on her bow string. She began to aim.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the air surrounding her changed. Her inexperience as a newly Novice-graduate showed by the obvious mana that leaked from the inside out. With naked eyes, her mana looked calm colorful haze that consisted of four bold colors, tangling and struggling with each other for dominance. Her eyelashes quivered. Channeling mana to cast a skill she yet had mastered felt like trying to stand on the raging sea waves while she herself was being a weak newborn.</p>\n<p><em>Whhhhuuuuushh--</em></p>\n<p><em>Shuuuhsh--</em></p>\n<p><em>Ssshhhuuuush--</em></p>\n<p><em>Wwhuuuussh!!</em></p>\n<p>The fastest arrow, coated with sparking yellow-colored mana, hit one of the targets at around forty meters range. But the others performed pitifully. The one infused with wet blue-colored mana didn’t even reach two-third of the desired range. The green-colored one, an arrow infused with mana that generated unstable wind trajectory flew far far away, as if it was getting swallowed by the sky, never to be seen again. The last one, the red-colored arrow, was horrifying. It hit the training ground fence instead the target. The bamboo fences suddenly set ablaze by raging flames as soon as the said arrow came into contact with them.</p>\n<p><em>Clap clap clap!</em></p>\n<p>Uninvited claps resounded across the training ground. On the wall Good-Natured Spirit clapping after watching a good spectacle. For getting hand claps from a Nalaq like him, naturally the level of talent Bhela showed just now was far beyond ordinary.</p>\n<p>“Thank you…” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>It appeared she knew beforehand the four-arrows skill she shot would make a mess. So she gathered the maidservants and made them extinguish the fences that started to burn into ashes. “Thank you, thank you for your hard work,” she said to a pair of maidservants who briskly went back and forth to kill the fire before its spread.</p>\n<p>“Ah! Young lady, what skill was that just now?” one of the maidservants gawked after the fire was extinguished.</p>\n<p>“That wasn’t just your ordinary Archer skill, was it?” added the other.</p>\n<p>Summoning a blazing fire just with an arrow and pure mana was unheard of. At least, the maidservants knew nobody in the village could do that.</p>\n<p>Bhela drank a glass of murky liquify herbs mixed with mint to cool down her manasphere. “It’s something I learned when I was away,” she said after putting down the glass on the tray her maid servants provided. She continued, “I still can’t master it, though.”</p>\n<p>She cast her eyes at the unharmed targets one by one. Shooting at forty meters range was still too much for her using four arrows at the same time. When the maidservants realized her difficulty, they encouraged her to simplify it and shoot one arrow at a time. However at their suggestion, Bhela shook her head. “It’s the requirement of this skill I’ve got to shoot four arrows,” she explained.</p>\n<p>The maidservants nodded at her words and apologized for their shallow suggestion.</p>\n<p>“Don’t mind that,” Bhela waved her hand. “There’s something I heard from people, by the way. Something about Young Master Yashura.”</p>\n<p>The two maidservants glanced at each other before one of them replied. “The rumor says… he holed up from the public’s view because he’s ashamed he can’t even become a Level 4 Novice.”</p>\n<p>“Are the Yashura Family elders still favoring him as the heir of Yashura Family Patriarch?”</p>\n<p>“We don’t know whether they still favor him or not. But Yashura Family always united in their standing. So unless the current Patriarch of Yashura Family has a son, the Young Master Shira Yashura will undoubtedly become the next patriarch.”</p>\n<p>“No rumors about the Yashura Family elders wavering then?”</p>\n<p>The maidservants shook their heads altogether.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela… apologize for giving you my shallow suggestion once again but…” one of the maidservants came near to Bhela and whispered, “With him as the heir, Yashura Family’s future will be bleak. Everyone in our family said your father’s bad condition is a bad omen for us mingling with those simple Yashuras. I’m very sorry if this sounds impudent--but you should’ve better cut ties with them before too late, young lady. Madam was too grieved by your father’s ill health to make decisions thus the only one who can save our Malikh Family is you.”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at the maidservant. The glint on her eyes changed.</p>\n<p>“There’s already a plan laid to help our Malikh Family,” that was all Bhela said. “You better not say something like that again. You lucky no one here beside me to hear you utter that kind of words.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you for your mercy, young lady! We are sorry for being impudent!”</p>\n<p>They decided to make it history with only the four of them who knew the previous conversation. The four of them; the young lady and two maid servants and one Nalaq spirit who came here uninvited.</p>\n<p>“It seems I just heard something I shouldn’t hear,” Good-Natured Spirit said while he rubbed his chin. He came here peeking. He didn’t have the intention to reveal himself while the girls below had a secret conversation ignorant of his presence.</p>\n<p>After that Bhela continued with light training. Good-Natured Spirit watched her doing simple shooting, she didn’t even use a slightest of her mana from then on. Yawning, Good-Natured Spirit stood up. Then he flew away from Malikh Family and began to look for some other interesting thing to sate his boredom.</p>\n<hr>\n<authors-note id=\"Radhy\">\n<p>Testing, testing.

Upon reporting back to the head maid for her old post, she was told that there was a new girl who already filled it--and for her to continue to work in Blackwood Family, there was no other way except for coming to work as the Blackwood Family’s young lady’s private attendant.</p>\n<p>Being an attendant of someone from the main bloodline from a mere common maidservant was a promotion--normally. It was different when it came to the Young Lady of Blackwood Family. Just when Jane thought she had just received bad luck due to her unfaithful partner, another worse luck hit her hard.</p>\n<p>“Head maid! Please, anything but there!” she promptly cling on the head maid’s legs. “Don’t send me to Young Lady’s place, please so something for me to get my old post back, we’re sisters for years, head maid! Please, do me a favor--just this once!”</p>\n<p>“Jane, don’t be foolish, the new girl is Butler Tim’s niece. They’ve been waiting for a post to be empty to slip her in the past two months. Do you think I could get it back that easily?”</p>\n<p>“H-head maid…” Jane knew, although Butler Tim didn’t have enough influence to be a tyrant in Blackwood Family’s manor, still not someone Jane could afford to offend. Biting her bottom lip, she whispered, “Please, head maid… if I perished due to bad luck, how could my family pay their debts?”</p>\n<p>“Get up now. Didn’t you say you have a way to pay it without working here for a dozen years more?”</p>\n<p>“That was before,” Jane’s voice was hoarse, “I never would’ve thought that bastard only spout empty promises of taking care of my family and other bullshit. Maybe it’s my lucky star that the bastard didn’t manage to make me pregnant after all this time!”</p>\n<p>“Now you know better than rely your future on nauseating romance, so I’m going to tell you, Jane--second chances are hard to get, you need to grasp it if one appears in front of you.”</p>\n<p>“But wouldn’t it be my last chance I’m to serve Young Lady Blackwood? Everybody’s ended up dead after they were sent to Young Lady’s place!”</p>\n<p>“Nonsense. Emeralda and Jenny are still alive and well these past six months there.”</p>\n<p>“Their death is only a matter of time!”</p>\n<p>Head maid sighed.</p>\n<p>“Jane oh Jane, I’m sending you not because I want to see your demise. You’re hardworking girl albeit annoying, how come I want you to die?”</p>\n<p>Jane already feeling numb being called names by this woman ten years her senior. Though in her heart she cursed head maid with nicknames like old virgin or such, she still desperate enough for tears falling down her cheeks. “Head maid, what do you mean by that?”</p>\n<p>“Don’t you know Sir Arden Blackwood had inquired about young lady’s place a few times recently?” head maid asked her with enigmatic smile.</p>\n<p>Jane blinked. She immediately came to head maid as soon as she knew her old post being taken and didn’t have time to gossip with other maidservants. “Really, head maid, you know I just came back. Don’t talk in a roundabout way…”</p>\n<p>“Sir Arden is going to hire an expert to clear plague in our Young Lady’s mansion, he’s planning to do it in a month's time,” the head maid said. “You know Sir Arden’s reputation, and you know how reliable his words are. Go serve Young Lady there--by the time Sir Arden comes with the hired expert, he’ll be grateful for loyal servants who willing to accompany his niece in her difficult time!”</p>\n<p>Hearing the urge behind head maid’s tone, Jane choked by her own cry from earlier. Even Madam Blackwood had to be polite to this younger brother of hers--as the man’s reputation was the sole reason Madam could be so tyrannical on ruling the house. But even then Sir Arden was too lazy to pay attention to his sister and her be. Jane, a mere maidservant--could she really gain Sir Arden Blackwood’s favor?</p>\n<p>The head maid continued, “What are you hesitating for? Even Floria that girl who even prettier than you couldn’t even get Sir Arden to glance at her--do you think any girl can have the same chance as yours right now?” she paused, learning the contour of Jane’s expression before she said again, “even if you can’t be his mistress, Jane, I assure you that even Butler Tim won’t be able to touch your position if Sir Arden Blackwood has a good impression on you.”</p>\n<p>Jane lowered her head. Head maid was right. A chance to get on Sir Arden Blackwood’s good side wouldn’t come as easily as this.</p>\n<p>She calculated the weight and found that, since two of her friends were sent to serve Young Lady Blackwood six month ago and still survive, a good odd that Sir Arden Blackwood would rescue her before the disease from Young Lady’s cursed bad luck would take her life for good.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>There was no need for her to prepare anything. Her luggage was ready since she didn’t get to visit her old dorm. The head maid even was generous to give Jean a gift money from her own pocket, making Jean feel less regret about how things turned out.</p>\n<p>To get into the young lady’s personal mansion, Jane already followed a quiet middle-aged steward with an old carriage pulled by an old mare, which had an appearance that was nothing fancy since the steward’s job all these past two years were only replenishing goods and food supplies. The mansion was originally the noble family’s vacation site, so the distance between the main mansion wasn’t trivial. It required almost the whole day to get there with the quiet steward’s creaky old carriage.</p>\n<p>When they about to arrive at the old mansion that hosted the Blackwood Family’s young lady, the quiet steward spoke, “The conditions of your colleagues aren’t good. We still haven’t yet sure of the epidemic’s epicenter, but we know there’s something wrong with nearby plants or water sources from the well in backyard of that mansion, so it’s best if you follow what the senior servant’s words from here forward.”</p>\n<p>Jane curled her lips sourly. This steward talked as if he was sincerely giving advice, yet for those in the main manor who didn’t know the rumors about their young lady? The thought spread amongst the servants since for these past three years the young lady was the sole survivor despite many of the servants being wiped out just by staying beside her in a month’s time.</p>\n<p>Arriving at the destination welcoming them were a pair of pale-faced maidservants waiting at the gate. Both were somehow familiar. A moment later, Jane was stupefied when she found out that the two white doll-like girls with black eyebags on them were actually Emeralda and Jenny she had known back since her first year being a maidservant. No longer Jane could see two noise sisters of hers who always skipped work to gossip, only two sets of dead eyes left, seeing her but not with greeting eyes, almost like strangers.</p>\n<p>“Welcome,” Emeralda greeted with a flat tone.</p>\n<p>“Welcome,” the other girl repeated. No enthusiasm could be hear within their voices, as if they were greeting a stranger before them.</p>\n<p>Jane didn’t expect this. Six months of serving in this damned mansion indeed could change gossip friends into strangers. Even when she tried to strike a conversation what replied her were business-like formal speech. In the end, the only thing Jane could do was pretend to be busy helping the quiet steward unload the carriage.</p>\n<p>Both Jenny and Emeralda probably were chosen to welcome her because their familiarity with each other. At least, when they noticed her was there. There were one other maidservant and one old nanny beside them, whom, when Jane tried to greet them, didn’t even bat an eye and continued to be busy sweeping a clean place instead.</p>\n<p>“Listen, you,” the quiet steward approached Jane after he done unloading supplies and about to return back to the city, “I will come back one week after this to replenish the kitchen. If you’ve got any questions, ask them directly to the old nanny who’s taking care of the young lady. Other maidservants are occupied. It’s best for you not to disturb them when they are busy.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” Jane replied, said nothing else. There was nothing she could say anyway, especially when she saw the usually lazy friends of hers became strangers and suspiciously diligent instead--they were so diligent that they spent the afternoon circling the yard looking for hidden dry leaves to sweep.</p>\n","volume-4/chapter-10-7":"<p><em>From the tender age of six, the Young Lady of Blackwood Family had lived alongside a deadly pandemic.</em></p>\n<p><em>For she is cursed.</em></p>\n<p><em>And to serve beside her means Blackwood Family has abandoned you.</em></p>\n<hr>\n<p>There was a particular maidservant in Blackwood Family named Jane who had just returned because the marriage she almost had was canceled due to her fiancé’s adultery. Upon reporting back to the head maid for her old post, she was told that there was a new girl who already filled it--and for her to continue to work in Blackwood Family, there was no other way except for coming to work as the Blackwood Family’s young lady’s private attendant.</p>\n<p>Being an attendant of someone from the main bloodline from a mere common maidservant was a promotion--normally. It was different when it came to the Young Lady of Blackwood Family. Just when Jane thought she had just received bad luck due to her unfaithful partner, another worse luck hit her hard.</p>\n<p>“Head maid! Please, anything but there!” she promptly cling on the head maid’s legs. “Don’t send me to Young Lady’s place, please so something for me to get my old post back, we’re sisters for years, head maid! Please, do me a favor--just this once!”</p>\n<p>“Jane, don’t be foolish, the new girl is Butler Tim’s niece. They’ve been waiting for a post to be empty to slip her in the past two months. Do you think I could get it back that easily?”</p>\n<p>“H-head maid…” Jane knew, although Butler Tim didn’t have enough influence to be a tyrant in Blackwood Family’s manor, still not someone Jane could afford to offend. Biting her bottom lip, she whispered, “Please, head maid… if I perished due to bad luck, how could my family pay their debts?”</p>\n<p>“Get up now. Didn’t you say you have a way to pay it without working here for a dozen years more?”</p>\n<p>“That was before,” Jane’s voice was hoarse, “I never would’ve thought that bastard only spout empty promises of taking care of my family and other bullshit. Maybe it’s my lucky star that the bastard didn’t manage to make me pregnant after all this time!”</p>\n<p>“Now you know better than rely your future on nauseating romance, so I’m going to tell you, Jane--second chances are hard to get, you need to grasp it if one appears in front of you.”</p>\n<p>“But wouldn’t it be my last chance I’m to serve Young Lady Blackwood? Everybody’s ended up dead after they were sent to Young Lady’s place!”</p>\n<p>“Nonsense. Emeralda and Jenny are still alive and well these past six months there.”</p>\n<p>“Their death is only a matter of time!”</p>\n<p>Head maid sighed.</p>\n<p>“Jane oh Jane, I’m sending you not because I want to see your demise. You’re hardworking girl albeit annoying, how come I want you to die?”</p>\n<p>Jane already feeling numb being called names by this woman ten years her senior. Though in her heart she cursed head maid with nicknames like old virgin or such, she still desperate enough for tears falling down her cheeks. “Head maid, what do you mean by that?”</p>\n<p>“Don’t you know Sir Arden Blackwood had inquired about young lady’s place a few times recently?” head maid asked her with enigmatic smile.</p>\n<p>Jane blinked. She immediately came to head maid as soon as she knew her old post being taken and didn’t have time to gossip with other maidservants. “Really, head maid, you know I just came back. Don’t talk in a roundabout way…”</p>\n<p>“Sir Arden is going to hire an expert to clear plague in our Young Lady’s mansion, he’s planning to do it in a month's time,” the head maid said. “You know Sir Arden’s reputation, and you know how reliable his words are. Go serve Young Lady there--by the time Sir Arden comes with the hired expert, he’ll be grateful for loyal servants who willing to accompany his niece in her difficult time!”</p>\n<p>Hearing the urge behind head maid’s tone, Jane choked by her own cry from earlier. Even Madam Blackwood had to be polite to this younger brother of hers--as the man’s reputation was the sole reason Madam could be so tyrannical on ruling the house. But even then Sir Arden was too lazy to pay attention to his sister and her be. Jane, a mere maidservant--could she really gain Sir Arden Blackwood’s favor?</p>\n<p>The head maid continued, “What are you hesitating for? Even Floria that girl who even prettier than you couldn’t even get Sir Arden to glance at her--do you think any girl can have the same chance as yours right now?” she paused, learning the contour of Jane’s expression before she said again, “even if you can’t be his mistress, Jane, I assure you that even Butler Tim won’t be able to touch your position if Sir Arden Blackwood has a good impression on you.”</p>\n<p>Jane lowered her head. Head maid was right. A chance to get on Sir Arden Blackwood’s good side wouldn’t come as easily as this.</p>\n<p>She calculated the weight and found that, since two of her friends were sent to serve Young Lady Blackwood six month ago and still survive, a good odd that Sir Arden Blackwood would rescue her before the disease from Young Lady’s cursed bad luck would take her life for good.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>There was no need for her to prepare anything. Her luggage was ready since she didn’t get to visit her old dorm. The head maid even was generous to give Jean a gift money from her own pocket, making Jean feel less regret about how things turned out.</p>\n<p>To get into the young lady’s personal mansion, Jane already followed a quiet middle-aged steward with an old carriage pulled by an old mare, which had an appearance that was nothing fancy since the steward’s job all these past two years were only replenishing goods and food supplies. The mansion was originally the noble family’s vacation site, so the distance between the main mansion wasn’t trivial. It required almost the whole day to get there with the quiet steward’s creaky old carriage.</p>\n<p>When they about to arrive at the old mansion that hosted the Blackwood Family’s young lady, the quiet steward spoke, “The conditions of your colleagues aren’t good. We still haven’t yet sure of the epidemic’s epicenter, but we know there’s something wrong with nearby plants or water sources from the well in backyard of that mansion, so it’s best if you follow what the senior servant’s words from here forward.”</p>\n<p>Jane curled her lips sourly. This steward talked as if he was sincerely giving advice, yet for those in the main manor who didn’t know the rumors about their young lady? The thought spread amongst the servants since for these past three years the young lady was the sole survivor despite many of the servants being wiped out just by staying beside her in a month’s time.</p>\n<p>Arriving at the destination welcoming them were a pair of pale-faced maidservants waiting at the gate. Both were somehow familiar. A moment later, Jane was stupefied when she found out that the two white doll-like girls with black eyebags on them were actually Emeralda and Jenny she had known back since her first year being a maidservant. No longer Jane could see two noise sisters of hers who always skipped work to gossip, only two sets of dead eyes left, seeing her but not with greeting eyes, almost like strangers.</p>\n<p>“Welcome,” Emeralda greeted with a flat tone.</p>\n<p>“Welcome,” the other girl repeated. No enthusiasm could be hear within their voices, as if they were greeting a stranger before them.</p>\n<p>Jane didn’t expect this. Six months of serving in this damned mansion indeed could change gossip friends into strangers. Even when she tried to strike a conversation what replied her were business-like formal speech. In the end, the only thing Jane could do was pretend to be busy helping the quiet steward unload the carriage.</p>\n<p>Both Jenny and Emeralda probably were chosen to welcome her because their familiarity with each other. At least, when they noticed her was there. There were one other maidservant and one old nanny beside them, whom, when Jane tried to greet them, didn’t even bat an eye and continued to be busy sweeping a clean place instead.</p>\n<p>“Listen, you,” the quiet steward approached Jane after he done unloading supplies and about to return back to the city, “I will come back one week after this to replenish the kitchen. If you’ve got any questions, ask them directly to the old nanny who’s taking care of the young lady. Other maidservants are occupied. It’s best for you not to disturb them when they are busy.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” Jane replied, said nothing else. There was nothing she could say anyway, especially when she saw the usually lazy friends of hers became strangers and suspiciously diligent instead--they were so diligent that they spent the afternoon circling the yard looking for hidden dry leaves to sweep.</p>\n","volume-4/chapter-2-5":"<p>Dinner at Malikh Family; the family hall bustling with relatives who wanted to celebrate Bhela Malikh’s return. Even though the expensive Ngajen Ceremony drew near a good number of ducks and a goat were butchered along with their spice reserves taken out. There were laughters, there lots of people wanted to get on the good side of the only Young Lady of Malikh Family.</p>\n<p>But Bhela’s face was straight the whole time. Given choices, she’d rather have a small dinner with her mother and sick father right now.</p>\n<p>“I heard you went to Elzhier’s training facility as soon as you arrived, young lady,” a bald elder said with big smile. “That is no good. You just return home after four days of traveling. You must have a good rest first.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you for your concern, Elder Jhamil.”</p>\n<p>Bhela had experience with people during her two years abroad to know the meaning of smiles like Elder Jhamil’s--the kind of smile that didn’t reach eyes, the fake kind of smile. She always found it was uncomfortable whenever she met with one. Yet what was more uncomfortable was the fact she was the star of the party. Flatteries and congratulations flowing in. Bhela kept nodding her head and had a smiling expression on her face. No one really had a good time beside the ignorant families who came to find abundant foods to eat.</p>\n<p>Finally toward the end of the big dinner Elder Jhamil gave a few speeches and led everyone for their patriarch's health. Bhela hadn’t come home for two years, but she was alert enough to know the popular opinion going around inside the Malikh Family. She knew her father was disliked by many because the engagement he set up more than a dozen years ago, back when she wasn’t even able to speak yet, back when the Malikhs didn’t think much of it and didn’t know the girl back then would grow splendidly into a fair Young Lady. What she didn’t expect was that, Elder Jhamil, would point it out in front of other family members.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady, I’m sure you’re aware about it by now, but the one from Yashura Family is still stuck on the same level from back when you were leaving for your seminars.”</p>\n<p>“I’m aware, yes,” she said. “And?”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil smiled dryly at the question, he said, “With a partner that lazy he’d drag you sooner or later, wouldn’t he? Especially with special talent as yours, many would have second thoughts. But then how about you? Are you fine with that, Young Lady?”</p>\n<p>Bhela didn’t immediately say what was on her mind. She quietly picked the warm ginger drink they served her, drank it, while her eyes glanced at a certain direction where two maidservants who immediately glanced down the moment her eyes came into contact with theirs.</p>\n<p>Seeing that Bhela wasn’t that responsive with the idea, Elder Jhamil spoke further, “Young Lady, don’t worry, we as Malikhs only worried about your future. If you feel injustice in your heart, you must be brave, you must voice it out to your parents, Young Lady Bhela--all of us Malikhs support you for whichever path you choose! Isn’t that right, everyone?”</p>\n<p>“That’s right!” someone shouted. Then came more rougher voice--</p>\n<p>“We don’t fear those Yashura’s retaliation, Young Lady. You don’t have to be afraid they’ll come here to bully us because of that trash from Yashura Family!”</p>\n<p>“We support you, Young Lady!”</p>\n<p>“Don’t be afraid!”</p>\n<p>The dry smile on Elder Jhamil turned elated when people were chanting along with his cue. It was only when Bhela slowly put down the warm glass of ginger drink in her hand did they stop making ruckus, everyone was waiting for what Bhela was going to say next.</p>\n<p>“I think,” Bhela said with the remarkable cold expression of hers, “any engagement in the main family should be the main family’s business only.”</p>\n<p>She stopped. Not a single more soul dared to send her further flatteries until dinner was over. Even the bald Elder Jhamil, the most enthusiastic of all them, quietly sat back where he belonged.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>“Ah, young lady, please wait, Young Lady Bhela!” the bald Elder Jhamil chased her, trotting, with a box in his hands.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh frowned upon hearing the voice. But she hid her expression well as turned around and asked, “Is something the matter, Elder Jhamil?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, in fact, there’s one matter a bit inappropriate to deal in the family hall,” as soon as Elder Jhamil said that, he opened the box he carried. It was a dress. “It’s something that I get from a merchant who has a lot of dealing with people in the west. He told me this is apparently the current popular fashion for western nobles. I think it’s good for Young Lady.”</p>\n<p>Bhela studied Elder Jhamil’s expression. If the dress truly was a fashionable goods then the elder ought to have paid a quite of coins to get this. As far as Bhela Malikh remembered, Elder Jhamil she knew wasn’t this kind even when her father the patriarch married. Naturally with such an expensive homecoming gift, Bhela was alerted.</p>\n<p>“Thank you for your kindness, Elder Jhamil. Bhela will treasure this well.”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, you don’t have to mention it, Young Lady Bhela,” Elder Jhamil said with a laugh. Then, while rubbing his palms unconsciously, the bald elder began to smile--not a fake one like he usually did have, a genuine smile, one that reflected his current emotion--the smile of greed. “By the way, young lady,” he continued, “I heard you getting along well with the Young Master from the noble Blackwood Family during your time away…”</p>\n<p>“Young Lady of Blackwood Family is my friend,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“Yeah but… I also heard in the next ngajen ceremony, Young Master Blackwood would grace us with his presence… is that true?”</p>\n<p>“I wouldn’t know.”</p>\n<p>“Hehe,” Elder Jhamil chuckled knowingly. “I think things would go well if you wear that dress during ngajen ceremony, young lady.”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh said a short and ambiguous reply and tried to get away from the bald elder. After she escaped in the lone corridor, she took out the dress from the box. The said dress was glimmering under the torchlight, yet, in spite of that, Bhela wasn’t happy the slightest bit.</p>\n<p>“This kind of thing…”</p>\n<p>A proper dress for ladies of southern people was hiding everything below the collarbone. Showing more, akin to invite men to do something indecent. Bhela wasn’t a conservative to follow Mossack customes down rigidly as shown from her cutting her hair short despite the gesture usually reserved for unavailable widows. But still, something like decency of girlhood, was something even someone duller than Bhela should have. Even daring courtesans would think twice to wear this kind of provocative dress to attend a festivity made by the Mossack majority.</p>\n<p>It was distasteful. Bhela didn’t want to think too much about it. After putting back the dress, Bhela walked again to the east wing of Malikh Family where her father was resting.</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim Malikh’s sick room once used as the family’s <b>Alchemist</b> workplace. It had long been vacant, thus usually used to care sick and injured people, as it had the most complete medicinal facility in the entire Malikh Family. Upon entering the room, Bhela found the thick pungent of herbs made her head light. And still she was amazed by how loyal her mother was to taking care of her father closely when servants would need to take a breather of fresh air ten minutes inside the sick room.</p>\n<p>“Father, mother, I’m back…. Did they send some food here?”</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh, the mother, was the one who replied to Bhela. “They did. Some people might forget about the patriarch’s little family but there are still good aunties working in the kitchen,” a middle-aged woman said with a hint of sadness, helplessness, and resentment.</p>\n<p>“Does mother want some hot tea? I’ll go fetch and say my thanks for those good aunties,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“You girl, sit down. You just returned today, now you want to run around doing errands?” Madam Malikh smiled weakly. “How’s the village, dear? Does it change from the way you remembered?”</p>\n<p>“Somes changed, others stay the same, mother,” Bhela said. She got to the table and put the box Elder Jhamil gifted, then took it off her mind. She then picked a random book from the shelves. “Can I stay here for a while?” she asked while showing the book to her mother, telling her the intention that she was going to read it there.</p>\n<p>The mother’s smile turned strained. At noon, she purposely told this daughter of hers to see around the village because she was afraid, if Bhela spent too much time in this room, she would feel uncomfortable by the thick medicinal smell and grow to hate the idea of staying. Even some maidservants a few years older than her were fidgeting and eyeing for the door every time they had duty to bring a meal here. Yet, looking from her daughter’s unflinching eyes, Madam Malikh was relented in the end.</p>\n<p>“Sit here,” the mother offered her chair for her daughter, while she sat down on the edge of her husband’s bed.</p>\n<p>Bhela’s moved with small, noiseless steps, trying not to wake up her father. But it was unfortunate that her father woke up nonetheless.</p>\n<p>“Le… letter…”</p>\n<p>The quivering voice escaped his cracking dry lips.</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh wanted to retort. Not the letter again. No matter how many times she read it aloud he still thirst for the letter as if it was the only salvation left for his life. Nonetheless, she surrendered and she picked a smooth, white paper made from wood--the kind which was expensive and usually used overseas--and began to read its content.</p>\n<p>“I understand your situation. But sending help from where I am takes a while. Ask Yulong’s help for now.”</p>\n<p>As if the letter was his assurance, Patriarch Ghalim Malikh closed his eyes again.</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at her mother who folded the recently opened letter, she asked. “Whose letter is that?”</p>\n<p>“Your great-grandmother who lived overseas,” her mother said.</p>\n<p>“I see.” Bhela wasn’t sure which relative her mother mentioned, but she decided to ask something else seeing her mother’s bad mood. “Why Great-grandmother mentioned something about Yulong? Isn’t Yulong the Yashura Family’s butler, mother?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know, I reckon she told us to rely on Yashura Family instead.”</p>\n<p>The strained smile on her mother’s face made Bhela realize that even her mother was reluctant when Yashura Family was mentioned. As a mother, she loved Bhela dearly, and was the one to believe in her daughter before everyone else. She believed in her daughter’s future. That was why she was first to oppose Bhela’s engagement when the sour rumors about the heir of the Yashura Family started. Never would she expect that her Malikh Family would be in dire straits so suddenly they needed Yashura Family’s help to get them out of this mess.</p>\n<p>“Have you sent someone to inform Yulong, mother?” Bhela asked.</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh shook her head. Bhela reckoned with Elder Jhamil gaining influence so fast, her mother wouldn’t know anyone to trust in this kind of situation.</p>\n<p>The girl then gave her mother a glass of water to ease her down. “I’ll let him know then,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Dear,” Madam Malikh brushed her daughter’s hair as she smiled helplessly, “showing your face in Yashura Family might complicate things…”</p>\n<p>Bhela patted her mother’s hands and assured her, “Don’t worry, mother,” she said, “I’ll ask favors from people I know from Elzhier Family.”</p>\n<p>Bhela thought her parents would go along with her arrangement. Madam Malikh hung open her lips as if she wanted to say something, but then she tightened her smile in the end. Unexpectedly, it was a weak voice that disagreed instead.</p>\n<p>“Bhela… don’t...” her father whispered weakly.</p>\n<p>“Dear?” mother leaned on toward his mouth.</p>\n<p>“What is it, father?” Bhela, too, leaned closer.</p>\n<p>“Don’t… ask… don’t… favor… purple...” the sickly patriarch’s voice turned hoarse and defragmented before he completed his sentences. Bhela and her mother quickly shushed him, they couldn’t afford to see the sick father forcing himself with this condition. Even after two minutes, he still struggled to tell his words to his daughter. Though eventually he fell to slumber by himself after his wife tried to put him to sleep with her eyes wet with tears.</p>\n<p>Beside her mother, Bhela picked a bamboo fan and used it to make a breeze for her father’s sleep to be more comfortable. Her expression was flat and straight the entire time, but inside, she was disturbed by the words her father failed to tell her.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>For as long as the Yashuras knew him, their Young Master Shira Yashura lived alone in his house. The only other person who should’ve been living here, his father, didn’t come home for months already. So ever since his uncle let him live in his house a few years back, Shira enjoyed an independent lifestyle he’d take for granted one of these days.</p>\n<p>At night, his schedule often filled with working on painting commissions Good-Natured Spirit gave him. Which, unfortunately, not something he wished for people to know. This part of his schedule was one of his secrets, if known by a certain meddlesome cousin, hell would surely be waiting for him.</p>\n<p>“I told you again and again,” a voice from behind him blurted, “you should’ve shown the boobs a little more.”</p>\n<p>Shira turned his head and groaned when he found the Nalaq’s annoying face a little bit too close. “Can you knock the door first?”</p>\n<p>“No way. I came through the wall. Door? What is door? Never use the thing since ages ago.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t creep up from behind, then. At least preserve your dignity as a Nalaq.”</p>\n<p>“I told you, don’t call me Nalaq,” Good-Natured Spirit hissed. “Anyway, boobs! The bweebs!! Make it more sexy! More bold and open!”</p>\n<p>“That’s not what we agreed on,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“Just a little, man. A little dot--tiny nipply dot--that’s all I’m asking for.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t push it, old man.”</p>\n<p>“Ah! You’re not fun anymore,” Good-Natured Spirit moaned in disatisfaction. In addition of Nalaq, Good-Natured Spirit was never fond of being called old. He died in his early thirty. So he retained the look, and he--according to himself--was still as handsome as ever. “Ah, forget it,” he waved his hand lazily. “Your drawings are second-rate porns anyway.”</p>\n<p>“You’re not paying for this one again?” Shira asked.</p>\n<p>“Not this one. Too safe. Don’t want it. At least make her boobs and butt bigger for the next time.”</p>\n<p>Shira sighed and wrapped it up for tonight. Everytime Good-Natured Spirit cancelled the commission's Shira wouldn’t have any choice but selling the paintings half-baked to a peddler he knew. Not even a half price, he’d be lucky if the rejected paintings would sell even one-fifth from Good-Natured Spirit’s usual payment.</p>\n<p>While Shira was tidying up his room, Good-Natured Spirit looked at the lady in the painting. The Nalaq said, “Hmm. I gotta say, man, despite your second-rate skill you’re natural when it comes to drawing faces. Especially the eyes. How should I say this… those aren’t the eyes of cheap bitches usually have, I tell you.”</p>\n<p>Shira didn’t know whether he should feel flattered or not. After he tidied the room and hid the naughty painting carefully, he prepared to go to sleep.</p>\n<p>“Oh, by the way,” Good-Natured Spirit said as Shira changed his shirt, “I’ve checked on your girl, brat. She’s a real good beauty, alright. Her talent too is not to be scoffed at. And also--boobs.”</p>\n<p>Shira glanced at him with tightened brows. “I’ll be troubled if they somehow trace it back to me in case the Young Lady of Malikh Family was assaulted.”</p>\n<p>“Hehe, relax man, I’ll never touch my buddy’s chick. We’re buddies, aren’t we?”</p>\n<p>Shira wanted to say no but he felt it’d be better for him not to comment on that. He then hurriedly kicked out the Nalaq so he could get some sleep in peace.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In almost all of Mossack race traditions, ngajen ceremony held monthly in villages near a mountain. It was one of those legacy of ancient Mossack that still around simply because of its practice brought safety to the people. Originally was a session of prayers and offerings to calm down Selaqs which dwelling on the mountains--they had to, because many stories being passed down in every families that even ancient tribe chieftains and heroes couldn’t do nothing if waves of Selaqs rampaged over the southern lands. Though, as the cost of ceremony getting more expensive as the time went on and getting more political, nowadays it became a time of feasts for big families to assert their surrounding influence. And a time of feasts where small and independent families gained side incomes from providing food and good for the big families’ feats. Ngajen ceremony was also the main reason why there was a weird rule for every Mossack-rooted families, tribes, and clans, that saying the leaders must be someone of a great cook--the majority of them were simply foodies.</p>\n<p>“And thus, Shira my boy--” the patriarch said as he played with his thick moustache, “--us southern people are naturally different from those imperialist western Haldeens and those warmongers feudalists of eastern Kaya. We don’t simply become leaders because of our noble bloodlines or merits and achievements in battle but simply because of food. This is an important lesson, my boy: no matter one hails from a noble blood or being a simple commoner, no matter one’s an enemy or ally, in the end, everyone’s going to eat happily and peacefully when we southern cooks shove foods up in their mouths. Remember that.”</p>\n<p>Shira Yashura quietly nodded. He didn’t plan to learn cooking from the start but, as the heir of Yashura Family, spending effort on foods probably one of the most important lessons before he became the next Patriarch of Yashura Family.</p>\n<p>“So you understand. Good. Sooner or later you’ll understand being strong is not everything, having talent is not everything,” the patriarch said. “Look at your father, for instance. He’s the only one in Badril Village who has an Unique class since… I don’t know, many many years. He’s pretty badass, eh? But why is that the one who ended up being the patriarch was me?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, Uncle Shuro, please do tell me.”</p>\n<p>Shuro Yashura, the patriarch uncle, smiled as he looked at his obedient nephew. He then half-bragging said, “Because he can only boil water, that’s why. Cooking is a great heritage of our ancestors thus those who have no talent on it as to be satisfied with being a second-rate Mossack. The only reason why people like me always ended up becoming the leader of clans because we Mossack appreciate food to a very high degree. Justice is food. Food is justice. With great cooking comes great responsibility.”</p>\n<p>But from the side a sour voice butted in, “Ohh. You’ll never know how much bullshit my father made up just now.”</p>\n<p>Uncle and nephew turned their heads to see a daughter pop her head from the window. Apparently, Mila Yashura had just returned from doing morning errands.</p>\n<p>“What are you guys doing anyway?” she asked. Apparently, in the kitchen, she saw her father and cousin shredding a ridiculous amount of coconuts. No one else was here in the kitchen, so Mila asked, “Did you two really do these by all yourselves?”</p>\n<p>“Of course,” her father, the revered patriarch, said as his hand vigorously shredded coconut. He couldn’t hide the annoying proud smile on his mustache filled face.</p>\n<p>“Since dawn?” Mila asked again suspiciously.</p>\n<p>“Food is justice. Justice is food. With great cooking comes great responsibility. Shredding coconut is one of the fundamental lessons for Shira to become a great patriarch in the future.”</p>\n<p>“Well,” Mila commented, “that’s dumb.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, girl! What do you know? You know nothing about the important philosophy behind every essence of coconuts,” Shuro Yashura exploded. “Since you a girl who don’t have to lead the family then probably you’ll never understand. You’ll never have to understand the hidden substance of every food you’ve eaten! Almost every Mossack delicacies made with coconuts. That Bulayak Satay sauce you like so much is made with coconut milk as a base! And don’t forget goat stew! And baked shredded coconuts cookies! And rendang! You name it. Coconuts have been granted us with delicious foods ever since ancestors were hunters-gatherers! Our very roots of being the descendants of ancient Mossack race can be traced as long as one ponder the mystery behind every shred of coconuts! Look at ancient empires! The ancient Aratararadararam Empire, for an instance, five thousands years ago, formed their empire solely by cultivating lots of coconut trees! They’re building civilizations relying only on the blessing of coconuts! That’s how great coconuts are! Only us who were born to lead our very empire can understand how miraculous are to be feeling joyous in pondering the great essence of shredded coconuts. You don’t know this much then you’re a dumb girl, eh. What a waste of a daughter you are!!” After taking a deep breath, Patriarch Shuro snorted at his impudent daughter, then glanced at Shira, smiling. “Isn’t that right, Shira my boy?”</p>\n<p>That was dumb. Even Shira knew that much. Because of that he kept his head hung low and focused on his task of shredding coconuts, pretending not to hear the question coming at him.</p>\n<p>“See?” the patriarch smirked. “He’s too absorbed by the grace of shredding coconuts he doesn’t notice my words.”</p>\n<p>Mila rolled her eyes, began to ignore her father. “Anyway, Shira! Have you heard the story about that girl Malikh beating up the best Archer kid single-handedly?”</p>\n<p>Shira of course knew about the archery duel that happened yesterday. Because Yashura Family and Malikh Family were entangled in a planned marriage, almost everyone in Yashura Family--including servants and clueless children--were talking about it. Yet he couldn’t raise his head and answer. Do that, and his uncle Shuro would know he only pretended to be interested in shredding coconuts. He’d only hurt his uncle’s feelings that way. Thus, in spite of Mila being overly loud today, all Shira needed to do was shredding and shredding and sometimes stopped to feel the shredded coconuts with his fingers, releasing a solemn sigh, as if he found something profound in every fiber of shredded coconuts.</p>\n<p>“That’s my boy, you understand all too well after all,” Shuro Yashura nodded in satisfaction. He was relieved his successor could be that enlightened by the grace of shredded coconuts. He then glared at his own blood daughter, who supposed to be the princess of the family, nagging so loudly that she stood in borderline of being a tomboy girl and a fussy aunty.</p>\n<p>“Oh, man, just leave him alone, would ya? Just think how many years for him to catch up with his girl--the more you hold him back the more people talk shit about him, father!”</p>\n<p>“Please dear! Is that how you talk with your father? I’m not holding him back, okay?” Patriarch Shuro Yashura then asked Shira, “do I hold you back, Shira my boy?”</p>\n<p>Shira further lowered his head and pretended not to hear that as if he was a turtle.</p>\n<p>“Better be careful. He’s too deep in coconuts he doesn’t even hear me,” the patriarch gave his daughter a glare.</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura rolled her eyes. She crouched and disappeared from the window view, then stood up again a moment later. Her hand clutching a pebble.</p>\n<p>The patriarch gawked, “Oi, what are you--”</p>\n<p>Mila aimed the pebble at Shira and it hit his head with an audible knock.</p>\n<p>“Thousands of gods!” Shira swore.</p>\n<p>“Too deep my ass,” Mila sneered. Unlike her father, she knew too well whenever Shira playing dumb.</p>\n<p>“What do you want?” Shira asked as he rubbed his head.</p>\n<p>“Let’s train your sword skill. You don’t want to face your fiancée with that crappy skill of yours, do you?”</p>\n<p>Shira glanced at his uncle unwillingly. “Do I have to meet with Bhela in her Family?”</p>\n<p>“That’s right, Shira my boy. You rarely visit other houses during ngajen ceremony but old folks from the Elder Council think this is a good time to show Malikh Family our good will,” Shuro Yashura said. “Remember to pray for their patriarch’s health too. He’s your father best friend, after all.”</p>\n<p>As if waiting for Patriarch Shuro’s completed his words, the door of the kitchen knocked at the very moment. A tall gray-haired old man entered. He had a posture that was straight and sharp, classy western-style butler uniform that hadn’t had looked worn out in spite no tailors around to know how to sew the said uniform, and his hand was balanced to hold a tray with a dozen elixirs on top of it with his left hand fingers, while his right hand rested on his back as if he followed an etiquette stranger to most of the villagers. He was the sole butler in Yashura Family--and perhaps, the only butler that ever employed in Badril VIllage.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira, this month’s elixirs your father sent for you have arrived,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Thank you, Yulong.”</p>\n<p>As usual, Shira drank elixirs his father sent abroad without a rest. The content was painfully bitter, thank goodness Yulong provided brown sugars for the boy to nibble after he drank those. His father Jhuro Yashura said--in a letter from abroad--that the elixirs were some kind of nutrient custom-made only for Shira, were expensive, so they could only afford them every one or two months.</p>\n<p>“How do you feel, Shira my boy?”</p>\n<p>Shira said as he munched a brown sugar to dismiss the bitter after taste. “Uh-hm. Better?”</p>\n<p>The family always thought they were a level-boost potion, Jhuro once sent a potion that could increase Shira’s level up to Level 3 in a single gulp after all. But the elixirs seemed to do nothing other than let Shira sleep comfortably at night. Still, his relatives, especially Mila, put their hopes on the resourceful Jhuro Yashura to nurture his own son--the heir of Yashura Family.</p>\n<p>Seeing the lack of enthusiasm in his nephew’s eyes, Patriarch Shuro laughed and said, “Haha. If those don’t work on your progress problems, don’t let it bother you! Your father worked very hard as an instructor in second-rank school and he’d definitely send a better elixir, like that one from three years ago!”</p>\n<p>“Oh,” Shira nodded. The elixir from three years ago was special. He knew it the moment he drank the potion. The warm feeling surrounding his manasphere was special, as with only drinking from one bottle, he leveled up 2 levels overnight.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>After that his uncle let him go out of the kitchen, since it was promised that Shira would do errands for his aunt every morning.</p>\n<p>When he was heading off for his duty, Shira Yashura got pranked by Good-Natured Spirit in the hallway, popped out his head from a wall and cried, “Boo!”--which Shira ignored because Yulong the butler was walking behind him.</p>\n<p>Yulong said with a polite baritone voice of his, “Young Master Shira, do you perhaps would visit the peddler today?”</p>\n<p>Shira looked at the butler. The matter about him doing business with a peddler wasn’t known to the family; but since Yulong wasn’t a Yashura and had been taking care of him since little, he eventually knew about the few investment deals that Shira never talked about. After collecting his thoughts, the boy replied to Yulong’s question, “Depends on the errand I receive, really. My aunt still hasn’t given my errands this morning,” the boy said.</p>\n<p>“I see, Patriarch Shuro took your time since early morning, so if madam doesn’t take pity for you then young master would finish today’s morning errands a little too late.”</p>\n<p>“The market would be too crowded if that happened,” Shira lamented. It couldn’t be helped. Boys and girls around ages of nine and sixteen--before they received coming-of-age ceremony--had to finish several trivial tasks each morning from both parents. It was a custom mainly to educate filial piety, though some smart parents and big family policies would give errands for the young’uns to make them do things that were beneficial for their futures, like street smarts and forming their own social circles outside the playmates they met everyday. Because his mother wasn’t here since he was a baby, and his father never came home for months, it was his aunt who always gave him errands.</p>\n<p>“Young Master,” Yulong stopped him again, “I’m glad for Young Master taking initiatives to improve your life. You grow too fast for this old butler to look after you. But as a child stepping into the adult world, please let me give you a small advice.”</p>\n<p>“I’m all ears, Yulong.”</p>\n<p>Yulong said, “You cannot guarantee everyone’s nature all around you, Young Master. Especially those who come approaching you with impure motives. I hope Young Master understands this, and to not make friends with nasty people.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit, who was around, snorted.</p>\n<p>Shira pretended he didn’t hear the Nalaq and nodded at the butler’s words. “You don’t have to worry about the peddler. Even though he’s been peddling for two years now, I found the fella got a pretty good sense.”</p>\n<p>“Hearing your words relieves me greatly. Thank you.”</p>\n<p>Afterward, Yulong excused himself as he needed to check the servants’ works for the arrangement of Ngajen Ceremony. The butler unassumingly walked on the side of the corridor, avoiding Good-Natured Spirit who was floating in the way, as if he knew there was something unpleasant floating in the way.</p>\n<p>“So long, fucker,” Good-Natured Spirit flashed his middle finger to Yulong’s back who just passed him by. Of course, the old butler didn’t show any reaction to his insult.</p>\n<p>“Why did you always do that to him?” Shira said to him with a frown.</p>\n<p>“This middle finger?” Good-Natured Spirit asked back.</p>\n<p>“No, the insult.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit grinned.</p>\n<p>“You know nothing about this middle finger, eh? Hehehh heh....”</p>\n<p>Yulong was someone Shira heartily respected. He always used polite language when talking to the butler. Because of that he was irked by the way Good-Natured Spirit sneered.</p>\n<p>“I need to sell the painting you rejected before the market becomes too crowdy. Let’s go,” he said. Bantering with Good-Natured Spirit would only make him more cocky, so Shira held the urge to humor his annoying behavior and headed off to the village’s market.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Back in the kitchen, Mila stayed with his father--who still shredding coconuts--while she read from a see-through board in front of her.</p>\n<p>“Ugh… his experience didn’t even change a single point,” Mila groaned.</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro too engrossed himself in coconut to realize what his daughter was doing just now. “You did a <b>Status Window</b> on him?”</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura nodded. Her face was sour though. “Look at this, old man. See what’s wrong with the number?”</p>\n<p>“Hah, his <b>Dodge Rating</b> getting crazier than before,” Shuro Yashura said with his fingers rubbing his moustache.</p>\n<p>“No! Look, father--his combat attributes, look closely! <b>Strength</b>, <b>Agility</b>, <b>Dexterity</b>! All of them pitifully underdeveloped. And look at the <b>Wisdom</b> attribute now!”</p>\n<p>“Ooh, his Wisdom’s pretty high. I knew his head’s pretty good. No wonder he could ponder the real meaning of shredded coconuts… he’s really a wise kid, after all.”</p>\n<p>“Please be serious, father. This is a serious matter.”</p>\n<p>“I’m serious,” Shuro the patriarch frowned. “And shredded coconut is a serious matter too!”</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura took a deep breath. Getting emotional over her father’s stupidity would only complicate the conversation.</p>\n<p>“Did you really hear the nickname they gave you...?” Mila asked him as she massaged her forehead. “It’s toothless Yashura. Toothless!”</p>\n<p>“Who said that?”</p>\n<p>“People.”</p>\n<p>“Fuck them people,” Shuro said. He never heard those old fogies calling him “toothless”, so he reckoned young'uns were the ones who came up with that. He sighed. For them to call this patriarch who always held the title of the best cook in Badril Village, those young people really didn’t have a good sense in them.</p>\n<p>“Because there’s Uncle Jhuro’s watching us from behind as a patriarch you can be toothless incompetent all you want, father, but--”</p>\n<p>“Oi, mind your words!”</p>\n<p>“--But!” Mila asserted despite her father started to pout after being called an incompetent, “but my generation is going to be harsh. No one as skilled and as strong as Uncle Jhuro appeared in the young’uns to be the guardian lion as our emblem is supposed to be.”</p>\n<p>“That is maybe but what are you trying to say here?”</p>\n<p>“What I’m saying is Shira can’t afford to be another toothless patriarch. You’re a support class, father, a <b>Specialist</b> like me. In our Badril Village history no matter how great your cooking is and no matter how wide our connections are if a conflict to arise a support class as a patriarch, nobody’d take us seriously--that is, unless another Unique Class who can afford to stay here in the village appears to scare them annoying people.”</p>\n<p>“Hoo, it seems you’ve been using your head a lot recently. That’s quite surprising.”</p>\n<p>Mila pursed her lips.</p>\n<p>“Unlike a certain carefree toothless patriarch, me and most family members concerned about Shira’s progress stuck as a Level 3 Novice. And what’s more, that girl Bhela Malikh--I don’t like what she did with her hair.”</p>\n<p>“Her hair?”</p>\n<p>“She cut her hair short. I confirmed it myself.”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro shook his head. He knew what his daughter was worrying about. “Girl, nephew Bhela has been away from the village and our dull way of thinking. She had been living with people in different cultures and customs these past two years. Maybe she cut her hair because she wants to follow fashion. Like that Aunty Yarly’s girl who suddenly has her lips red with lip balms, see? The young'uns are always doing it whenever foreigners come bringing their latest fads with them. You’re thinking too much.”</p>\n<p>“Why does everyone think Bhela Malikh is just some brainless girl who doesn’t know what she’s doing?” Mila Yashura frowned. “She’s smart, father. Even Shira knows she’s smart. You know what Shira said when I told him her fiancée has short hair now?--”</p>\n<p>She smirked.</p>\n<p>“--He said, ‘the engagement’s not going to work’.”</p>\n<p>“Bah! He’s been saying that shit for years!”</p>\n<p>“I know, I know!” Mila said. “But this time he’s serious. He said that with a punchable face as if he was saying ‘see, I told you’. His face looked punchable, I tell ya!”</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura was genuinely angry. This time, Patriarch Shuro Yashura didn’t immediately reply. He looked at his daughter, scratched his head, said, “So, in short, you worried about we can’t do nothing if Bhela is serious about cutting her hair to state her stance on her own engagement?”</p>\n<p>“Well, yeah! Of course I am. Only widows who cut hairs like that!”</p>\n<p>“You think it’s because she doesn’t like being paired with our Shira who is much weaker than her?”</p>\n<p>“Well, duh, old man, you’re still asking the obvious?”</p>\n<p>“Then don’t worry, look again at his status,” Shuro Yashura tossed back the status window back to his daughter. Its lifespan hasn't yet expired, so it was still showing Shira’s attributes and status as Level 3 Novice. “See what’s wrong in there?”</p>\n<p>Mila opened her mouth, “His combat attributes--”</p>\n<p>“No, look again!” Shuro cut off.</p>\n<p>Despite knitting her eyebrows, Mila still didn’t catch his father’s drift.</p>\n<p>Seeing his daughter had a hard time figuring it out, Shuro Yashura revealed, “His elemental affinity. See?”</p>\n<p>“It’s <b>Water</b> elemental affinity. It’s not that rare. What’s wrong with it?”</p>\n<p>“Well, he’s still a Novice. Getting a class still far away from him.”</p>\n<p>When a person reached the first barrier at Level 10 and got his class, there was a chance for him to aversed in one or more elementals and largely transformed, or perhaps even enhanced, the skills he would get from the class he acquired. Not everyone, but the chance was more than fifty-fifty. Aside from the rare ones, four base elementals that commonly appeared were <b>Fire</b>, <b>Wind</b>, <b>Lightning</b>, and <b>Water</b>--Mila wasn’t sure what so special for her cousin acquired an affinity over one of those base elementals.</p>\n<p>“Have you seen anyone with an elemental affinity in his Novice years?” her father asked.</p>\n<p>“It’s rare…” Mila was unsure, “can’t say I have.”</p>\n<p>“You haven’t. I have,” Shuro Yashura said. “Twenty seven years ago. Your Uncle Jhuro had a huge fight with grandfather and he ran away into the Mossy Forest behind the mountain--for nearly three weeks. He ate wild fruits. He ate monster meat also. But in the last three days he got unlucky and got poisoned by a snake monster ten levels above him. He struggled with death. Alone in that forest. But he lived. The fool then decided the forest was too dangerous for him and he returned back home.”--and got to experience a near-death situation again after their furious father almost pummeled him to pulp, Patriarch Shuro’s memories drifted.</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura listened. She knew the story of how his uncle survived alone in Mossy Forest--it was crazy, a kind of legend for the young’uns today. That was the first story amongst stories about the Badril Village’s last Unique Class warrior--Jhuro Yashura the Blackfang Swordsman--the story that first made him famous in the village for his unordinary bravery and recklessness.</p>\n<p>Shuro Yashura asked her daughter, “You know what happened after that, right?”</p>\n<p>She nodded.</p>\n<p>“Uncle awakened his rare <b>Poison</b> elemental affinity.”</p>\n<p>And Jhuro Yashura wasn’t even reached Level 10 back then.</p>\n<p>There was an unspoken law of the system most people didn’t know. A premonition, or sign, more appropriately, that if a Novice got an elemental before acquiring a class, chance was, an Unique class would be waiting for him.</p>\n<p>“See what I’m getting at?” Shuro Yashura said with a smile. “Time will reveal it, you don’t have to worry. Sooner or later, there’ll be another Unique class in our Yashura Family.”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>That morning the family getting busy preparing for ngajen ceremony; family officials, the servants, even brats too, were busy with their own errands. Usually with a few of copper kobe coins older kids could secretly pass their morning errands to the little ones--as lazier and richer kids like Shira wasn’t foreign to the practice, but unfortunately he couldn’t find some kids to bribe even on days like this. Not that he wasn’t happy about it. The errand his aunt gave him accidentally had something to do in the market, the destination he’d go to sell his painting today anyway.</p>\n<p>“Is it me or someone’s been staring at me since I stepped out of my family’s gate?”</p>\n<p>“It’s not you,” Good-Natured Spirit replied to Shira's question. “It seems the stalker Big-Boobed Sect sent today was particularly sloopy, kinda annoying.”</p>\n<p>“Oh yeah? How many of them are following me?” Shira asked half-heartedly.</p>\n<p>“What? You don’t believe them Big-Boobed Sect always spying on us?”</p>\n<p>Shira shrugged. Good-Natured Spirit was right--the boy didn’t believe his ramblings about all-girl sect always hiding in Badril Village’s shadows, especially with those padded words about them being beautiful and having bountiful bodies. He didn’t believe it because he still got some common sense. Not to mention hidden sects, even some decent clans and schools wouldn’t bother with ordinary places like Badril Village.</p>\n<p>And thus as he had feared, the market was already crowded by then. The moment Shira realized it, Good-Natured Spirit already drifted away by the sight of excitement in gambling dens and beautiful young wives from Elzhier Family sold street foods. As it turned out, it was stamped on the Nalaq’s mind to get off Shira as soon as they came to the market lest the boy’d use him for errands one way or another. The peddler Shira acquainted with was getting a good crowd as he laid his wares behind his wagon.</p>\n<p>“Monkey!”</p>\n<p>The peddler behind the wares turned his head. He had a funny face, a rare trait that made him resemble a monkey. And there was no coincidence everyone called him Monkey. When Monkey slightly wandered his eyes through the crowd and saw Shira, he waved his hands to the grunting customers and told them he’d close his shop for a while.</p>\n<p>“Well, well, isn’t this our Young Master Shira blessing us with his presence?” the smiling Monkey briskly approached as he rubbed his palms excitedly. “Can I help you young master?”</p>\n<p>Shira stepped back when Monkey got too close. “Monkey, you better stop being creepy whenever I come visit you.”</p>\n<p>“You hurt me, young master. There’s nothing creepy about our business relationship.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, it’s your face. Don’t make me regret selling my painting to you.”</p>\n<p>“Haha, surely you jest, Young Master Shira--I’m trying my best to maintain a professional face from now on!” Monkey said that then immediately took a small peek at the content. “Your skill is just getting better and better, master. I’m sure this will sell well, Master!”</p>\n<p>“What’s with the master thing?”</p>\n<p>“How dare for me to call you ‘Young Master’ while you yourself are already an expert at this stage?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t want our relationship getting creepier than it already is,” Shira said, then he took out a pouch of coins. “Anyways, I got an errand from my aunt, so give me the thirteen dried spices worth all this money.”</p>\n<p>“What kind of spice?”</p>\n<p>“All kinds of spices.”</p>\n<p>“Of course, of course, I’ll give you a discount, just to celebrate your improvement in the path of drawing, Master.”</p>\n<p>By the time Shira got himself a basketful of spices, Monkey’s grin getting more annoying. The stereotypical fat and slimy merchants looked innocent compared to him. After Shira threw a frowning glance at him, he <em>reluctantly</em> admitted, “Young master may not know this, but recently I’ve got an Alchemist partner with me who was trying to be independent from his family,” he said. “And I must tell you, young master, this family is a many-hundreds of years Alchemists family, and you also must know he’s not kicked out of incompetente--”</p>\n<p>Shira cut his roundabout pitching. “You want me to back the Alchemist?”</p>\n<p>“Mmm...yes….” Monkey nodded with a wry smile.</p>\n<p>The boy’s eyes wandered through the peddler’s wares before looked at him in the eyes. “Even I must tread through the game of cat and dog with the elders because of the rules,” he explained to Monkey, who in turn, could only smile helplessly.</p>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>Mossack’s custom dictates children who haven’t gone through their coming of age ceremony--usually at the age of sixteen--to not being involved in politics and commerce. This is the reason why Shira--as he mostly acquired money winning through streaks of chess games with Good-Natured Spirit--couldn’t recklessly flaunt his personal wealth in public.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>The risk of having a relationship gone sour with this young master, Monkey knew that. It was unlikely for an upstart peddler to be relied on by a future patriarch of a big family, and he wholeheartedly believed it was unwise to create a trivial misunderstanding with Young Master Shira Yashura. After all, it was only one year until Shira would have his own coming of age ceremony. Therefore, Monkey didn’t want to impose on the Young Master’s kindness too much and quickly changed the topic with something he’d prepared beforehand.</p>\n<p>“This is a <b>Boost Elixir</b> concocted by my partner. He might not a 2nd-Tier Alchemist yet but I assure you, Young Master Shira, the elixir’s potent power won’t lose against any experts you’ll find anywhere!” Monkey said with his over-excited sales pitch, which made him look more funny than usual, “This humble bottle was scientifically proven to increase a person’s level as long as he is below the age of twenty! To date, this Boost Elixir has 100% effectiveness in increasing the user’s level! Young master, you are very lucky--you can have this miraculous elixir just for half of the original price today!”</p>\n<p>Though it was clear Monkey meant no harm, Shira narrowed his eyes at the pedder.</p>\n<p>“Did someone pay you to make me drink it?” he asked suspiciously.</p>\n<p>“You jest again, Young Master… ha ha… haaa….” Monkey awkwardly laughed as he tried to hide his dampened enthusiasm. “Why don’t you try it first, Young Master Shira. You don’t have to pay if you didn’t get to graduate from Level 3 Novice.”</p>\n<p>Eventually, Shira drank the Boost Elixir within a gulp, not because he believed its miraculous effect, but because he was weak for free and discounted goods.</p>\n<p>“Your EXP bar didn’t even budge a little,” Monkey muttered with a meek voice.</p>\n<p>“The liquid is surprisingly well made though. Is this really made by someone you know?”</p>\n<p>“I said before, Young Master. The one who made this hailed from an old Alchemist family that even outside South Tiramikal Kingdom their last name still can be a pretty big deal. I’m pretty confident that--normally--this elixir will have a 100% success rate for leveling up whoever drinks it!”</p>\n<p>“Such a confident boast. Are you perhaps implying that my case is not <em>normally</em>?”</p>\n<p>“He hehe, you surely joke. You know that I don’t mean any harm, young master.”</p>\n<p>Shira of course knew it. And the other thing he also knew, that if it was a really impressive elixir he just drank by now, the usual Monkey wouldn’t utter a single phrase of the word “free”, regardless how many times the elixir failed to deliver its promise.</p>\n<p>Shira looked at Monkey suspiciously, “You’re Monkey, aren’t you? Not someone brainwashed by my family’s enemy or something like that? You know, by vampires.”</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira… now your joke is not even funny--something like a poor peddler to be brainwashed only appears in stories. Vampires are some unfounded folklore.”</p>\n<p>“Monkey I know is stupid. If not brainwashed, then he definitely manipulated to sell a fake elixir to someone from big families.”</p>\n<p>Before Monkey was able to retort that, a cold voice came from the wagon. “Young Master Yashura, I don’t mind if you pinpoint Monkey’s stupidity and make assumptions about him muchever you want. But to call my elixir is fake, I can’t stand and watch around anymore.”</p>\n<p>A man appeared from the wagon Monkey had, had an appearance of the stereotypical scholar Shira had in mind--though, by the way he crossed his arms pompously, he seemed to have a pride worthy of someone hailed from big families.</p>\n<p>“You’re the Alchemist?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, you call me Snake--don’t ask for my real name,” the Alchemist said.</p>\n<p>One would hide his name if he didn’t want to be associated with his family anymore. So Shira didn’t ask. He looked at the scholarly Alchemist, then at the peddler. One was the Snake and the other one was the Monkey.</p>\n<p>Shira found some sort of strange camradice between them. “I see, so both of you decided to be a partner for life.”</p>\n<p>“Not for life, no. Spare me. It’s better for me to ditch this stupid ape as soon as he outlives his usefulness.”</p>\n<p>“Heey! Don’t say ditching in front of me!” Monkey protested. Snake ignored him without pretense, making the impression that this scene was ordinary for them.</p>\n<p>Shira then asked Snake straightforwardly.</p>\n<p>“What kind of elixir is this?”</p>\n<p>“Didn’t Monkey tell you? A Boost Elixir. My latest masterpiece,” Snake replied.</p>\n<p>“You’re aware that your partner tried to sell your masterpiece at a half price, right? I don’t even have to pay, it was what he said before.”</p>\n<p>“It was my idea,” Snake said. “This is a simple business hack. I’m confident about my concoctions. After all, I experimented heavily on human anatomy--too heavy, even, to the point folks in my family want me gone for good. I’ve got nothing to lose here. That bottle is a prototype; it cost a lot so I planned to price it a lot.”</p>\n<p>“You want to use my bad reputation as a stepping stone, don’t you?” Shira asked with a sour smile.</p>\n<p>“Yes. Do you mind?”</p>\n<p>“No, I’d gladly make profit out of those trash talking they did behind my back--though, it seems you picked the wrong guinea pig to be your mascot for your ‘business hack’,” Shira said with a wry smile.</p>\n<p>Monkey nodded weakly. As a peddler from outside the village, he was always bothered by how nasty rumors could be, especially with some acquaintance he depended on sometimes as an important business partner.</p>\n<p>Seeing that they no longer had things to chat about, Shira said to them he’d consider putting some resources if he managed to gain some nod from the family elders after he went through the coming-of-age ceremony next year. And now that he finished selling Good-Natured Spirit’s rejected commision and completed the errand his aunt gave him, Shira then bid farewell to the two animal-nicknamed gentlemen.</p>\n<p>“Please wait, Young Master Shira.”</p>\n<p>Shira turned back his head again and found Snake, the one who called him, ran back to Monkey’s wagon to grab something.</p>\n<p>“Try to drink this one,” Snake said after trotting back hurriedly. “It’s alright, you don’t have to pay for this time too.”</p>\n<p>The current elixir Snake took out was the exact opposite from the previous one. Its container was beautiful and high-class, but the content was muddy and very low in quality. Hearing that this one was also free, Shira didn’t hesitate to drink it.</p>\n<p>The after taste was incredibly sour. Unlike any other bitter concocted elixirs or potions he ever drank. Although not much, Shira could feel his body warming up. He was surprised at the unexpected reaction.</p>\n<p>“Oohhhh!!!” Monkey cried as his eyes glued at Shira’s Status Window. “The EXP bar moved!”</p>\n<p>“What?” the surprised Shira glanced at Snake and asked slowly, “This one’s free, right?”</p>\n<p>It was in a single flash Shira did catch a strange dumbfoundedness in Snake eyes, like the result even came more shocking than him than either of Shira and Monkey. Yet the moment after he promptly regained his stoic exposure, then said to Shira, “Don’t worry, I don’t plan to take back my words,”</p>\n<p>The odd Alchemist put his hands at his back and walked back to his wagon. Before he climbed the wagon, he once again glanced at Shira, looking in a state of half-disbelief like expression</p>\n<p>As Snake disappeared into the wagon, Shira and Monkey exchanged glances.</p>\n<p>“He still has that kind of face even though he promises it to be free? You sure do have an odd friend.” Shira said.</p>\n<p>Monkey grinned. “Though an oddball, I never seen anyone with more talent in alchemy than him, like, ever.”</p>\n<p>After leaving Monkey to continue his stall, Shira saw Good-Natured Spirit again when he visited a food stall not far from Monkey’s wagon. He asked what he was doing, and the Nalaq told him there was a fool who bet a lot and won a lot in the gambling games. To lose against in gambling against someone with Good-Natured Spirit’s caliber, really--Shira sighed--he couldn’t wait for his coming-of-age ceremony next year so he too could farm on these gullible people in some friendly matches--just like what he did with Good-Natured Spirit for this past one year.</p>\n<p>“You know,” munching on some satays he bought from the market, Shira muttered when he headed home along with Good-Natured Spirit, “just then I drank this elixir that really could boost my EXP a little. I don’t know how the guy concocts it, but I have the feeling that I just drink some very expensive elixir for free.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, yeah?”</p>\n<p>On the way back to Yashura Family Shira told the Nalaq spirit about the Alchemist and his elixirs. He also told him that his status that usually wouldn’t react to normal elixirs this time moved a bit after he drank a strange low-quality elixir.</p>\n<p>“That Alchemist must be a nerd to be that sharp,” Good-Natured Spirit said as he floated lazily beside the boy.</p>\n<p>“He looks like that too. The peddler he partnered with also has some good sense in him. So I thought it’s not a loss for me to use all those foreign coins I got from you to invest on them for the next year.”</p>\n<p>“Hmm,” Good-Natured Spirit crossed his arms. “I think you should be worried.”</p>\n<p>“Worried? Why?”</p>\n<p>“You said that nerd Alchemist was the one who pushed that low-quality elixir to you, right?”</p>\n<p>“I got to drink that for free,” Shira emphasized.</p>\n<p>“He realized one little secret about you then,” Good-Natured Spirit said.</p>\n<p>Shira stopped walking. He looked at him with his head tilted.</p>\n<p>“What secret?”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit who floated before, spoke again.</p>\n<p>“You shouldn’t worry about it too much for now, brat. But, I advise you, if you are still holding dear for your lazy, peaceful village life, you should turn back and kill him right now.”</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-4/chapter-2":"<p>Dinner at Malikh Family; the family hall bustling with relatives who wanted to celebrate Bhela Malikh’s return. Even though the expensive Ngajen Ceremony drew near a good number of ducks and a goat were butchered along with their spice reserves taken out. There were laughters, there lots of people wanted to get on the good side of the only Young Lady of Malikh Family.</p>\n<p>But Bhela’s face was straight the whole time. Given choices, she’d rather have a small dinner with her mother and sick father right now.</p>\n<p>“I heard you went to Elzhier’s training facility as soon as you arrived, young lady,” a bald elder said with big smile. “That is no good. You just return home after four days of traveling. You must have a good rest first.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you for your concern, Elder Jhamil.”</p>\n<p>Bhela had experience with people during her two years abroad to know the meaning of smiles like Elder Jhamil’s--the kind of smile that didn’t reach eyes, the fake kind of smile. She always found it was uncomfortable whenever she met with one. Yet what was more uncomfortable was the fact she was the star of the party. Flatteries and congratulations flowing in. Bhela kept nodding her head and had a smiling expression on her face. No one really had a good time beside the ignorant families who came to find abundant foods to eat.</p>\n<p>Finally toward the end of the big dinner Elder Jhamil gave a few speeches and led everyone for their patriarch's health. Bhela hadn’t come home for two years, but she was alert enough to know the popular opinion going around inside the Malikh Family. She knew her father was disliked by many because the engagement he set up more than a dozen years ago, back when she wasn’t even able to speak yet, back when the Malikhs didn’t think much of it and didn’t know the girl back then would grow splendidly into a fair Young Lady. What she didn’t expect was that, Elder Jhamil, would point it out in front of other family members.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady, I’m sure you’re aware about it by now, but the one from Yashura Family is still stuck on the same level from back when you were leaving for your seminars.”</p>\n<p>“I’m aware, yes,” she said. “And?”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil smiled dryly at the question, he said, “With a partner that lazy he’d drag you sooner or later, wouldn’t he? Especially with special talent as yours, many would have second thoughts. But then how about you? Are you fine with that, Young Lady?”</p>\n<p>Bhela didn’t immediately say what was on her mind. She quietly picked the warm ginger drink they served her, drank it, while her eyes glanced at a certain direction where two maidservants who immediately glanced down the moment her eyes came into contact with theirs.</p>\n<p>Seeing that Bhela wasn’t that responsive with the idea, Elder Jhamil spoke further, “Young Lady, don’t worry, we as Malikhs only worried about your future. If you feel injustice in your heart, you must be brave, you must voice it out to your parents, Young Lady Bhela--all of us Malikhs support you for whichever path you choose! Isn’t that right, everyone?”</p>\n<p>“That’s right!” someone shouted. Then came more rougher voice--</p>\n<p>“We don’t fear those Yashura’s retaliation, Young Lady. You don’t have to be afraid they’ll come here to bully us because of that trash from Yashura Family!”</p>\n<p>“We support you, Young Lady!”</p>\n<p>“Don’t be afraid!”</p>\n<p>The dry smile on Elder Jhamil turned elated when people were chanting along with his cue. It was only when Bhela slowly put down the warm glass of ginger drink in her hand did they stop making ruckus, everyone was waiting for what Bhela was going to say next.</p>\n<p>“I think,” Bhela said with the remarkable cold expression of hers, “any engagement in the main family should be the main family’s business only.”</p>\n<p>She stopped. Not a single more soul dared to send her further flatteries until dinner was over. Even the bald Elder Jhamil, the most enthusiastic of all them, quietly sat back where he belonged.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>“Ah, young lady, please wait, Young Lady Bhela!” the bald Elder Jhamil chased her, trotting, with a box in his hands.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh frowned upon hearing the voice. But she hid her expression well as turned around and asked, “Is something the matter, Elder Jhamil?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, in fact, there’s one matter a bit inappropriate to deal in the family hall,” as soon as Elder Jhamil said that, he opened the box he carried. It was a dress. “It’s something that I get from a merchant who has a lot of dealing with people in the west. He told me this is apparently the current popular fashion for western nobles. I think it’s good for Young Lady.”</p>\n<p>Bhela studied Elder Jhamil’s expression. If the dress truly was a fashionable goods then the elder ought to have paid a quite of coins to get this. As far as Bhela Malikh remembered, Elder Jhamil she knew wasn’t this kind even when her father the patriarch married. Naturally with such an expensive homecoming gift, Bhela was alerted.</p>\n<p>“Thank you for your kindness, Elder Jhamil. Bhela will treasure this well.”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, you don’t have to mention it, Young Lady Bhela,” Elder Jhamil said with a laugh. Then, while rubbing his palms unconsciously, the bald elder began to smile--not a fake one like he usually did have, a genuine smile, one that reflected his current emotion--the smile of greed. “By the way, young lady,” he continued, “I heard you getting along well with the Young Master from the noble Blackwood Family during your time away…”</p>\n<p>“Young Lady of Blackwood Family is my friend,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“Yeah but… I also heard in the next ngajen ceremony, Young Master Blackwood would grace us with his presence… is that true?”</p>\n<p>“I wouldn’t know.”</p>\n<p>“Hehe,” Elder Jhamil chuckled knowingly. “I think things would go well if you wear that dress during ngajen ceremony, young lady.”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh said a short and ambiguous reply and tried to get away from the bald elder. After she escaped in the lone corridor, she took out the dress from the box. The said dress was glimmering under the torchlight, yet, in spite of that, Bhela wasn’t happy the slightest bit.</p>\n<p>“This kind of thing…”</p>\n<p>A proper dress for ladies of southern people was hiding everything below the collarbone. Showing more, akin to invite men to do something indecent. Bhela wasn’t a conservative to follow Mossack customes down rigidly as shown from her cutting her hair short despite the gesture usually reserved for unavailable widows. But still, something like decency of girlhood, was something even someone duller than Bhela should have. Even daring courtesans would think twice to wear this kind of provocative dress to attend a festivity made by the Mossack majority.</p>\n<p>It was distasteful. Bhela didn’t want to think too much about it. After putting back the dress, Bhela walked again to the east wing of Malikh Family where her father was resting.</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim Malikh’s sick room once used as the family’s <b>Alchemist</b> workplace. It had long been vacant, thus usually used to care sick and injured people, as it had the most complete medicinal facility in the entire Malikh Family. Upon entering the room, Bhela found the thick pungent of herbs made her head light. And still she was amazed by how loyal her mother was to taking care of her father closely when servants would need to take a breather of fresh air ten minutes inside the sick room.</p>\n<p>“Father, mother, I’m back…. Did they send some food here?”</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh, the mother, was the one who replied to Bhela. “They did. Some people might forget about the patriarch’s little family but there are still good aunties working in the kitchen,” a middle-aged woman said with a hint of sadness, helplessness, and resentment.</p>\n<p>“Does mother want some hot tea? I’ll go fetch and say my thanks for those good aunties,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“You girl, sit down. You just returned today, now you want to run around doing errands?” Madam Malikh smiled weakly. “How’s the village, dear? Does it change from the way you remembered?”</p>\n<p>“Somes changed, others stay the same, mother,” Bhela said. She got to the table and put the box Elder Jhamil gifted, then took it off her mind. She then picked a random book from the shelves. “Can I stay here for a while?” she asked while showing the book to her mother, telling her the intention that she was going to read it there.</p>\n<p>The mother’s smile turned strained. At noon, she purposely told this daughter of hers to see around the village because she was afraid, if Bhela spent too much time in this room, she would feel uncomfortable by the thick medicinal smell and grow to hate the idea of staying. Even some maidservants a few years older than her were fidgeting and eyeing for the door every time they had duty to bring a meal here. Yet, looking from her daughter’s unflinching eyes, Madam Malikh was relented in the end.</p>\n<p>“Sit here,” the mother offered her chair for her daughter, while she sat down on the edge of her husband’s bed.</p>\n<p>Bhela’s moved with small, noiseless steps, trying not to wake up her father. But it was unfortunate that her father woke up nonetheless.</p>\n<p>“Le… letter…”</p>\n<p>The quivering voice escaped his cracking dry lips.</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh wanted to retort. Not the letter again. No matter how many times she read it aloud he still thirst for the letter as if it was the only salvation left for his life. Nonetheless, she surrendered and she picked a smooth, white paper made from wood--the kind which was expensive and usually used overseas--and began to read its content.</p>\n<p>“I understand your situation. But sending help from where I am takes a while. Ask Yulong’s help for now.”</p>\n<p>As if the letter was his assurance, Patriarch Ghalim Malikh closed his eyes again.</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at her mother who folded the recently opened letter, she asked. “Whose letter is that?”</p>\n<p>“Your great-grandmother who lived overseas,” her mother said.</p>\n<p>“I see.” Bhela wasn’t sure which relative her mother mentioned, but she decided to ask something else seeing her mother’s bad mood. “Why Great-grandmother mentioned something about Yulong? Isn’t Yulong the Yashura Family’s butler, mother?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know, I reckon she told us to rely on Yashura Family instead.”</p>\n<p>The strained smile on her mother’s face made Bhela realize that even her mother was reluctant when Yashura Family was mentioned. As a mother, she loved Bhela dearly, and was the one to believe in her daughter before everyone else. She believed in her daughter’s future. That was why she was first to oppose Bhela’s engagement when the sour rumors about the heir of the Yashura Family started. Never would she expect that her Malikh Family would be in dire straits so suddenly they needed Yashura Family’s help to get them out of this mess.</p>\n<p>“Have you sent someone to inform Yulong, mother?” Bhela asked.</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh shook her head. Bhela reckoned with Elder Jhamil gaining influence so fast, her mother wouldn’t know anyone to trust in this kind of situation.</p>\n<p>The girl then gave her mother a glass of water to ease her down. “I’ll let him know then,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Dear,” Madam Malikh brushed her daughter’s hair as she smiled helplessly, “showing your face in Yashura Family might complicate things…”</p>\n<p>Bhela patted her mother’s hands and assured her, “Don’t worry, mother,” she said, “I’ll ask favors from people I know from Elzhier Family.”</p>\n<p>Bhela thought her parents would go along with her arrangement. Madam Malikh hung open her lips as if she wanted to say something, but then she tightened her smile in the end. Unexpectedly, it was a weak voice that disagreed instead.</p>\n<p>“Bhela… don’t...” her father whispered weakly.</p>\n<p>“Dear?” mother leaned on toward his mouth.</p>\n<p>“What is it, father?” Bhela, too, leaned closer.</p>\n<p>“Don’t… ask… don’t… favor… purple...” the sickly patriarch’s voice turned hoarse and defragmented before he completed his sentences. Bhela and her mother quickly shushed him, they couldn’t afford to see the sick father forcing himself with this condition. Even after two minutes, he still struggled to tell his words to his daughter. Though eventually he fell to slumber by himself after his wife tried to put him to sleep with her eyes wet with tears.</p>\n<p>Beside her mother, Bhela picked a bamboo fan and used it to make a breeze for her father’s sleep to be more comfortable. Her expression was flat and straight the entire time, but inside, she was disturbed by the words her father failed to tell her.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>For as long as the Yashuras knew him, their Young Master Shira Yashura lived alone in his house. The only other person who should’ve been living here, his father, didn’t come home for months already. So ever since his uncle let him live in his house a few years back, Shira enjoyed an independent lifestyle he’d take for granted one of these days.</p>\n<p>At night, his schedule often filled with working on painting commissions Good-Natured Spirit gave him. Which, unfortunately, not something he wished for people to know. This part of his schedule was one of his secrets, if known by a certain meddlesome cousin, hell would surely be waiting for him.</p>\n<p>“I told you again and again,” a voice from behind him blurted, “you should’ve shown the boobs a little more.”</p>\n<p>Shira turned his head and groaned when he found the Nalaq’s annoying face a little bit too close. “Can you knock the door first?”</p>\n<p>“No way. I came through the wall. Door? What is door? Never use the thing since ages ago.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t creep up from behind, then. At least preserve your dignity as a Nalaq.”</p>\n<p>“I told you, don’t call me Nalaq,” Good-Natured Spirit hissed. “Anyway, boobs! The bweebs!! Make it more sexy! More bold and open!”</p>\n<p>“That’s not what we agreed on,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“Just a little, man. A little dot--tiny nipply dot--that’s all I’m asking for.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t push it, old man.”</p>\n<p>“Ah! You’re not fun anymore,” Good-Natured Spirit moaned in disatisfaction. In addition of Nalaq, Good-Natured Spirit was never fond of being called old. He died in his early thirty. So he retained the look, and he--according to himself--was still as handsome as ever. “Ah, forget it,” he waved his hand lazily. “Your drawings are second-rate porns anyway.”</p>\n<p>“You’re not paying for this one again?” Shira asked.</p>\n<p>“Not this one. Too safe. Don’t want it. At least make her boobs and butt bigger for the next time.”</p>\n<p>Shira sighed and wrapped it up for tonight. Everytime Good-Natured Spirit cancelled the commission's Shira wouldn’t have any choice but selling the paintings half-baked to a peddler he knew. Not even a half price, he’d be lucky if the rejected paintings would sell even one-fifth from Good-Natured Spirit’s usual payment.</p>\n<p>While Shira was tidying up his room, Good-Natured Spirit looked at the lady in the painting. The Nalaq said, “Hmm. I gotta say, man, despite your second-rate skill you’re natural when it comes to drawing faces. Especially the eyes. How should I say this… those aren’t the eyes of cheap bitches usually have, I tell you.”</p>\n<p>Shira didn’t know whether he should feel flattered or not. After he tidied the room and hid the naughty painting carefully, he prepared to go to sleep.</p>\n<p>“Oh, by the way,” Good-Natured Spirit said as Shira changed his shirt, “I’ve checked on your girl, brat. She’s a real good beauty, alright. Her talent too is not to be scoffed at. And also--boobs.”</p>\n<p>Shira glanced at him with tightened brows. “I’ll be troubled if they somehow trace it back to me in case the Young Lady of Malikh Family was assaulted.”</p>\n<p>“Hehe, relax man, I’ll never touch my buddy’s chick. We’re buddies, aren’t we?”</p>\n<p>Shira wanted to say no but he felt it’d be better for him not to comment on that. He then hurriedly kicked out the Nalaq so he could get some sleep in peace.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In almost all of Mossack race traditions, ngajen ceremony held monthly in villages near a mountain. It was one of those legacy of ancient Mossack that still around simply because of its practice brought safety to the people. Originally was a session of prayers and offerings to calm down Selaqs which dwelling on the mountains--they had to, because many stories being passed down in every families that even ancient tribe chieftains and heroes couldn’t do nothing if waves of Selaqs rampaged over the southern lands. Though, as the cost of ceremony getting more expensive as the time went on and getting more political, nowadays it became a time of feasts for big families to assert their surrounding influence. And a time of feasts where small and independent families gained side incomes from providing food and good for the big families’ feats. Ngajen ceremony was also the main reason why there was a weird rule for every Mossack-rooted families, tribes, and clans, that saying the leaders must be someone of a great cook--the majority of them were simply foodies.</p>\n<p>“And thus, Shira my boy--” the patriarch said as he played with his thick moustache, “--us southern people are naturally different from those imperialist western Haldeens and those warmongers feudalists of eastern Kaya. We don’t simply become leaders because of our noble bloodlines or merits and achievements in battle but simply because of food. This is an important lesson, my boy: no matter one hails from a noble blood or being a simple commoner, no matter one’s an enemy or ally, in the end, everyone’s going to eat happily and peacefully when we southern cooks shove foods up in their mouths. Remember that.”</p>\n<p>Shira Yashura quietly nodded. He didn’t plan to learn cooking from the start but, as the heir of Yashura Family, spending effort on foods probably one of the most important lessons before he became the next Patriarch of Yashura Family.</p>\n<p>“So you understand. Good. Sooner or later you’ll understand being strong is not everything, having talent is not everything,” the patriarch said. “Look at your father, for instance. He’s the only one in Badril Village who has an Unique class since… I don’t know, many many years. He’s pretty badass, eh? But why is that the one who ended up being the patriarch was me?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, Uncle Shuro, please do tell me.”</p>\n<p>Shuro Yashura, the patriarch uncle, smiled as he looked at his obedient nephew. He then half-bragging said, “Because he can only boil water, that’s why. Cooking is a great heritage of our ancestors thus those who have no talent on it as to be satisfied with being a second-rate Mossack. The only reason why people like me always ended up becoming the leader of clans because we Mossack appreciate food to a very high degree. Justice is food. Food is justice. With great cooking comes great responsibility.”</p>\n<p>But from the side a sour voice butted in, “Ohh. You’ll never know how much bullshit my father made up just now.”</p>\n<p>Uncle and nephew turned their heads to see a daughter pop her head from the window. Apparently, Mila Yashura had just returned from doing morning errands.</p>\n<p>“What are you guys doing anyway?” she asked. Apparently, in the kitchen, she saw her father and cousin shredding a ridiculous amount of coconuts. No one else was here in the kitchen, so Mila asked, “Did you two really do these by all yourselves?”</p>\n<p>“Of course,” her father, the revered patriarch, said as his hand vigorously shredded coconut. He couldn’t hide the annoying proud smile on his mustache filled face.</p>\n<p>“Since dawn?” Mila asked again suspiciously.</p>\n<p>“Food is justice. Justice is food. With great cooking comes great responsibility. Shredding coconut is one of the fundamental lessons for Shira to become a great patriarch in the future.”</p>\n<p>“Well,” Mila commented, “that’s dumb.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, girl! What do you know? You know nothing about the important philosophy behind every essence of coconuts,” Shuro Yashura exploded. “Since you a girl who don’t have to lead the family then probably you’ll never understand. You’ll never have to understand the hidden substance of every food you’ve eaten! Almost every Mossack delicacies made with coconuts. That Bulayak Satay sauce you like so much is made with coconut milk as a base! And don’t forget goat stew! And baked shredded coconuts cookies! And rendang! You name it. Coconuts have been granted us with delicious foods ever since ancestors were hunters-gatherers! Our very roots of being the descendants of ancient Mossack race can be traced as long as one ponder the mystery behind every shred of coconuts! Look at ancient empires! The ancient Aratararadararam Empire, for an instance, five thousands years ago, formed their empire solely by cultivating lots of coconut trees! They’re building civilizations relying only on the blessing of coconuts! That’s how great coconuts are! Only us who were born to lead our very empire can understand how miraculous are to be feeling joyous in pondering the great essence of shredded coconuts. You don’t know this much then you’re a dumb girl, eh. What a waste of a daughter you are!!” After taking a deep breath, Patriarch Shuro snorted at his impudent daughter, then glanced at Shira, smiling. “Isn’t that right, Shira my boy?”</p>\n<p>That was dumb. Even Shira knew that much. Because of that he kept his head hung low and focused on his task of shredding coconuts, pretending not to hear the question coming at him.</p>\n<p>“See?” the patriarch smirked. “He’s too absorbed by the grace of shredding coconuts he doesn’t notice my words.”</p>\n<p>Mila rolled her eyes, began to ignore her father. “Anyway, Shira! Have you heard the story about that girl Malikh beating up the best Archer kid single-handedly?”</p>\n<p>Shira of course knew about the archery duel that happened yesterday. Because Yashura Family and Malikh Family were entangled in a planned marriage, almost everyone in Yashura Family--including servants and clueless children--were talking about it. Yet he couldn’t raise his head and answer. Do that, and his uncle Shuro would know he only pretended to be interested in shredding coconuts. He’d only hurt his uncle’s feelings that way. Thus, in spite of Mila being overly loud today, all Shira needed to do was shredding and shredding and sometimes stopped to feel the shredded coconuts with his fingers, releasing a solemn sigh, as if he found something profound in every fiber of shredded coconuts.</p>\n<p>“That’s my boy, you understand all too well after all,” Shuro Yashura nodded in satisfaction. He was relieved his successor could be that enlightened by the grace of shredded coconuts. He then glared at his own blood daughter, who supposed to be the princess of the family, nagging so loudly that she stood in borderline of being a tomboy girl and a fussy aunty.</p>\n<p>“Oh, man, just leave him alone, would ya? Just think how many years for him to catch up with his girl--the more you hold him back the more people talk shit about him, father!”</p>\n<p>“Please dear! Is that how you talk with your father? I’m not holding him back, okay?” Patriarch Shuro Yashura then asked Shira, “do I hold you back, Shira my boy?”</p>\n<p>Shira further lowered his head and pretended not to hear that as if he was a turtle.</p>\n<p>“Better be careful. He’s too deep in coconuts he doesn’t even hear me,” the patriarch gave his daughter a glare.</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura rolled her eyes. She crouched and disappeared from the window view, then stood up again a moment later. Her hand clutching a pebble.</p>\n<p>The patriarch gawked, “Oi, what are you--”</p>\n<p>Mila aimed the pebble at Shira and it hit his head with an audible knock.</p>\n<p>“Thousands of gods!” Shira swore.</p>\n<p>“Too deep my ass,” Mila sneered. Unlike her father, she knew too well whenever Shira playing dumb.</p>\n<p>“What do you want?” Shira asked as he rubbed his head.</p>\n<p>“Let’s train your sword skill. You don’t want to face your fiancée with that crappy skill of yours, do you?”</p>\n<p>Shira glanced at his uncle unwillingly. “Do I have to meet with Bhela in her Family?”</p>\n<p>“That’s right, Shira my boy. You rarely visit other houses during ngajen ceremony but old folks from the Elder Council think this is a good time to show Malikh Family our good will,” Shuro Yashura said. “Remember to pray for their patriarch’s health too. He’s your father best friend, after all.”</p>\n<p>As if waiting for Patriarch Shuro’s completed his words, the door of the kitchen knocked at the very moment. A tall gray-haired old man entered. He had a posture that was straight and sharp, classy western-style butler uniform that hadn’t had looked worn out in spite no tailors around to know how to sew the said uniform, and his hand was balanced to hold a tray with a dozen elixirs on top of it with his left hand fingers, while his right hand rested on his back as if he followed an etiquette stranger to most of the villagers. He was the sole butler in Yashura Family--and perhaps, the only butler that ever employed in Badril VIllage.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira, this month’s elixirs your father sent for you have arrived,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Thank you, Yulong.”</p>\n<p>As usual, Shira drank elixirs his father sent abroad without a rest. The content was painfully bitter, thank goodness Yulong provided brown sugars for the boy to nibble after he drank those. His father Jhuro Yashura said--in a letter from abroad--that the elixirs were some kind of nutrient custom-made only for Shira, were expensive, so they could only afford them every one or two months.</p>\n<p>“How do you feel, Shira my boy?”</p>\n<p>Shira said as he munched a brown sugar to dismiss the bitter after taste. “Uh-hm. Better?”</p>\n<p>The family always thought they were a level-boost potion, Jhuro once sent a potion that could increase Shira’s level up to Level 3 in a single gulp after all. But the elixirs seemed to do nothing other than let Shira sleep comfortably at night. Still, his relatives, especially Mila, put their hopes on the resourceful Jhuro Yashura to nurture his own son--the heir of Yashura Family.</p>\n<p>Seeing the lack of enthusiasm in his nephew’s eyes, Patriarch Shuro laughed and said, “Haha. If those don’t work on your progress problems, don’t let it bother you! Your father worked very hard as an instructor in second-rank school and he’d definitely send a better elixir, like that one from three years ago!”</p>\n<p>“Oh,” Shira nodded. The elixir from three years ago was special. He knew it the moment he drank the potion. The warm feeling surrounding his manasphere was special, as with only drinking from one bottle, he leveled up 2 levels overnight.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>After that his uncle let him go out of the kitchen, since it was promised that Shira would do errands for his aunt every morning.</p>\n<p>When he was heading off for his duty, Shira Yashura got pranked by Good-Natured Spirit in the hallway, popped out his head from a wall and cried, “Boo!”--which Shira ignored because Yulong the butler was walking behind him.</p>\n<p>Yulong said with a polite baritone voice of his, “Young Master Shira, do you perhaps would visit the peddler today?”</p>\n<p>Shira looked at the butler. The matter about him doing business with a peddler wasn’t known to the family; but since Yulong wasn’t a Yashura and had been taking care of him since little, he eventually knew about the few investment deals that Shira never talked about. After collecting his thoughts, the boy replied to Yulong’s question, “Depends on the errand I receive, really. My aunt still hasn’t given my errands this morning,” the boy said.</p>\n<p>“I see, Patriarch Shuro took your time since early morning, so if madam doesn’t take pity for you then young master would finish today’s morning errands a little too late.”</p>\n<p>“The market would be too crowded if that happened,” Shira lamented. It couldn’t be helped. Boys and girls around ages of nine and sixteen--before they received coming-of-age ceremony--had to finish several trivial tasks each morning from both parents. It was a custom mainly to educate filial piety, though some smart parents and big family policies would give errands for the young’uns to make them do things that were beneficial for their futures, like street smarts and forming their own social circles outside the playmates they met everyday. Because his mother wasn’t here since he was a baby, and his father never came home for months, it was his aunt who always gave him errands.</p>\n<p>“Young Master,” Yulong stopped him again, “I’m glad for Young Master taking initiatives to improve your life. You grow too fast for this old butler to look after you. But as a child stepping into the adult world, please let me give you a small advice.”</p>\n<p>“I’m all ears, Yulong.”</p>\n<p>Yulong said, “You cannot guarantee everyone’s nature all around you, Young Master. Especially those who come approaching you with impure motives. I hope Young Master understands this, and to not make friends with nasty people.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit, who was around, snorted.</p>\n<p>Shira pretended he didn’t hear the Nalaq and nodded at the butler’s words. “You don’t have to worry about the peddler. Even though he’s been peddling for two years now, I found the fella got a pretty good sense.”</p>\n<p>“Hearing your words relieves me greatly. Thank you.”</p>\n<p>Afterward, Yulong excused himself as he needed to check the servants’ works for the arrangement of Ngajen Ceremony. The butler unassumingly walked on the side of the corridor, avoiding Good-Natured Spirit who was floating in the way, as if he knew there was something unpleasant floating in the way.</p>\n<p>“So long, fucker,” Good-Natured Spirit flashed his middle finger to Yulong’s back who just passed him by. Of course, the old butler didn’t show any reaction to his insult.</p>\n<p>“Why did you always do that to him?” Shira said to him with a frown.</p>\n<p>“This middle finger?” Good-Natured Spirit asked back.</p>\n<p>“No, the insult.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit grinned.</p>\n<p>“You know nothing about this middle finger, eh? Hehehh heh....”</p>\n<p>Yulong was someone Shira heartily respected. He always used polite language when talking to the butler. Because of that he was irked by the way Good-Natured Spirit sneered.</p>\n<p>“I need to sell the painting you rejected before the market becomes too crowdy. Let’s go,” he said. Bantering with Good-Natured Spirit would only make him more cocky, so Shira held the urge to humor his annoying behavior and headed off to the village’s market.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Back in the kitchen, Mila stayed with his father--who still shredding coconuts--while she read from a see-through board in front of her.</p>\n<p>“Ugh… his experience didn’t even change a single point,” Mila groaned.</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro too engrossed himself in coconut to realize what his daughter was doing just now. “You did a <b>Status Window</b> on him?”</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura nodded. Her face was sour though. “Look at this, old man. See what’s wrong with the number?”</p>\n<p>“Hah, his <b>Dodge Rating</b> getting crazier than before,” Shuro Yashura said with his fingers rubbing his moustache.</p>\n<p>“No! Look, father--his combat attributes, look closely! <b>Strength</b>, <b>Agility</b>, <b>Dexterity</b>! All of them pitifully underdeveloped. And look at the <b>Wisdom</b> attribute now!”</p>\n<p>“Ooh, his Wisdom’s pretty high. I knew his head’s pretty good. No wonder he could ponder the real meaning of shredded coconuts… he’s really a wise kid, after all.”</p>\n<p>“Please be serious, father. This is a serious matter.”</p>\n<p>“I’m serious,” Shuro the patriarch frowned. “And shredded coconut is a serious matter too!”</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura took a deep breath. Getting emotional over her father’s stupidity would only complicate the conversation.</p>\n<p>“Did you really hear the nickname they gave you...?” Mila asked him as she massaged her forehead. “It’s toothless Yashura. Toothless!”</p>\n<p>“Who said that?”</p>\n<p>“People.”</p>\n<p>“Fuck them people,” Shuro said. He never heard those old fogies calling him “toothless”, so he reckoned young'uns were the ones who came up with that. He sighed. For them to call this patriarch who always held the title of the best cook in Badril Village, those young people really didn’t have a good sense in them.</p>\n<p>“Because there’s Uncle Jhuro’s watching us from behind as a patriarch you can be toothless incompetent all you want, father, but--”</p>\n<p>“Oi, mind your words!”</p>\n<p>“--But!” Mila asserted despite her father started to pout after being called an incompetent, “but my generation is going to be harsh. No one as skilled and as strong as Uncle Jhuro appeared in the young’uns to be the guardian lion as our emblem is supposed to be.”</p>\n<p>“That is maybe but what are you trying to say here?”</p>\n<p>“What I’m saying is Shira can’t afford to be another toothless patriarch. You’re a support class, father, a <b>Specialist</b> like me. In our Badril Village history no matter how great your cooking is and no matter how wide our connections are if a conflict to arise a support class as a patriarch, nobody’d take us seriously--that is, unless another Unique Class who can afford to stay here in the village appears to scare them annoying people.”</p>\n<p>“Hoo, it seems you’ve been using your head a lot recently. That’s quite surprising.”</p>\n<p>Mila pursed her lips.</p>\n<p>“Unlike a certain carefree toothless patriarch, me and most family members concerned about Shira’s progress stuck as a Level 3 Novice. And what’s more, that girl Bhela Malikh--I don’t like what she did with her hair.”</p>\n<p>“Her hair?”</p>\n<p>“She cut her hair short. I confirmed it myself.”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro shook his head. He knew what his daughter was worrying about. “Girl, nephew Bhela has been away from the village and our dull way of thinking. She had been living with people in different cultures and customs these past two years. Maybe she cut her hair because she wants to follow fashion. Like that Aunty Yarly’s girl who suddenly has her lips red with lip balms, see? The young'uns are always doing it whenever foreigners come bringing their latest fads with them. You’re thinking too much.”</p>\n<p>“Why does everyone think Bhela Malikh is just some brainless girl who doesn’t know what she’s doing?” Mila Yashura frowned. “She’s smart, father. Even Shira knows she’s smart. You know what Shira said when I told him her fiancée has short hair now?--”</p>\n<p>She smirked.</p>\n<p>“--He said, ‘the engagement’s not going to work’.”</p>\n<p>“Bah! He’s been saying that shit for years!”</p>\n<p>“I know, I know!” Mila said. “But this time he’s serious. He said that with a punchable face as if he was saying ‘see, I told you’. His face looked punchable, I tell ya!”</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura was genuinely angry. This time, Patriarch Shuro Yashura didn’t immediately reply. He looked at his daughter, scratched his head, said, “So, in short, you worried about we can’t do nothing if Bhela is serious about cutting her hair to state her stance on her own engagement?”</p>\n<p>“Well, yeah! Of course I am. Only widows who cut hairs like that!”</p>\n<p>“You think it’s because she doesn’t like being paired with our Shira who is much weaker than her?”</p>\n<p>“Well, duh, old man, you’re still asking the obvious?”</p>\n<p>“Then don’t worry, look again at his status,” Shuro Yashura tossed back the status window back to his daughter. Its lifespan hasn't yet expired, so it was still showing Shira’s attributes and status as Level 3 Novice. “See what’s wrong in there?”</p>\n<p>Mila opened her mouth, “His combat attributes--”</p>\n<p>“No, look again!” Shuro cut off.</p>\n<p>Despite knitting her eyebrows, Mila still didn’t catch his father’s drift.</p>\n<p>Seeing his daughter had a hard time figuring it out, Shuro Yashura revealed, “His elemental affinity. See?”</p>\n<p>“It’s <b>Water</b> elemental affinity. It’s not that rare. What’s wrong with it?”</p>\n<p>“Well, he’s still a Novice. Getting a class still far away from him.”</p>\n<p>When a person reached the first barrier at Level 10 and got his class, there was a chance for him to aversed in one or more elementals and largely transformed, or perhaps even enhanced, the skills he would get from the class he acquired. Not everyone, but the chance was more than fifty-fifty. Aside from the rare ones, four base elementals that commonly appeared were <b>Fire</b>, <b>Wind</b>, <b>Lightning</b>, and <b>Water</b>--Mila wasn’t sure what so special for her cousin acquired an affinity over one of those base elementals.</p>\n<p>“Have you seen anyone with an elemental affinity in his Novice years?” her father asked.</p>\n<p>“It’s rare…” Mila was unsure, “can’t say I have.”</p>\n<p>“You haven’t. I have,” Shuro Yashura said. “Twenty seven years ago. Your Uncle Jhuro had a huge fight with grandfather and he ran away into the Mossy Forest behind the mountain--for nearly three weeks. He ate wild fruits. He ate monster meat also. But in the last three days he got unlucky and got poisoned by a snake monster ten levels above him. He struggled with death. Alone in that forest. But he lived. The fool then decided the forest was too dangerous for him and he returned back home.”--and got to experience a near-death situation again after their furious father almost pummeled him to pulp, Patriarch Shuro’s memories drifted.</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura listened. She knew the story of how his uncle survived alone in Mossy Forest--it was crazy, a kind of legend for the young’uns today. That was the first story amongst stories about the Badril Village’s last Unique Class warrior--Jhuro Yashura the Blackfang Swordsman--the story that first made him famous in the village for his unordinary bravery and recklessness.</p>\n<p>Shuro Yashura asked her daughter, “You know what happened after that, right?”</p>\n<p>She nodded.</p>\n<p>“Uncle awakened his rare <b>Poison</b> elemental affinity.”</p>\n<p>And Jhuro Yashura wasn’t even reached Level 10 back then.</p>\n<p>There was an unspoken law of the system most people didn’t know. A premonition, or sign, more appropriately, that if a Novice got an elemental before acquiring a class, chance was, an Unique class would be waiting for him.</p>\n<p>“See what I’m getting at?” Shuro Yashura said with a smile. “Time will reveal it, you don’t have to worry. Sooner or later, there’ll be another Unique class in our Yashura Family.”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>That morning the family getting busy preparing for ngajen ceremony; family officials, the servants, even brats too, were busy with their own errands. Usually with a few of copper kobe coins older kids could secretly pass their morning errands to the little ones--as lazier and richer kids like Shira wasn’t foreign to the practice, but unfortunately he couldn’t find some kids to bribe even on days like this. Not that he wasn’t happy about it. The errand his aunt gave him accidentally had something to do in the market, the destination he’d go to sell his painting today anyway.</p>\n<p>“Is it me or someone’s been staring at me since I stepped out of my family’s gate?”</p>\n<p>“It’s not you,” Good-Natured Spirit replied to Shira's question. “It seems the stalker Big-Boobed Sect sent today was particularly sloopy, kinda annoying.”</p>\n<p>“Oh yeah? How many of them are following me?” Shira asked half-heartedly.</p>\n<p>“What? You don’t believe them Big-Boobed Sect always spying on us?”</p>\n<p>Shira shrugged. Good-Natured Spirit was right--the boy didn’t believe his ramblings about all-girl sect always hiding in Badril Village’s shadows, especially with those padded words about them being beautiful and having bountiful bodies. He didn’t believe it because he still got some common sense. Not to mention hidden sects, even some decent clans and schools wouldn’t bother with ordinary places like Badril Village.</p>\n<p>And thus as he had feared, the market was already crowded by then. The moment Shira realized it, Good-Natured Spirit already drifted away by the sight of excitement in gambling dens and beautiful young wives from Elzhier Family sold street foods. As it turned out, it was stamped on the Nalaq’s mind to get off Shira as soon as they came to the market lest the boy’d use him for errands one way or another. The peddler Shira acquainted with was getting a good crowd as he laid his wares behind his wagon.</p>\n<p>“Monkey!”</p>\n<p>The peddler behind the wares turned his head. He had a funny face, a rare trait that made him resemble a monkey. And there was no coincidence everyone called him Monkey. When Monkey slightly wandered his eyes through the crowd and saw Shira, he waved his hands to the grunting customers and told them he’d close his shop for a while.</p>\n<p>“Well, well, isn’t this our Young Master Shira blessing us with his presence?” the smiling Monkey briskly approached as he rubbed his palms excitedly. “Can I help you young master?”</p>\n<p>Shira stepped back when Monkey got too close. “Monkey, you better stop being creepy whenever I come visit you.”</p>\n<p>“You hurt me, young master. There’s nothing creepy about our business relationship.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, it’s your face. Don’t make me regret selling my painting to you.”</p>\n<p>“Haha, surely you jest, Young Master Shira--I’m trying my best to maintain a professional face from now on!” Monkey said that then immediately took a small peek at the content. “Your skill is just getting better and better, master. I’m sure this will sell well, Master!”</p>\n<p>“What’s with the master thing?”</p>\n<p>“How dare for me to call you ‘Young Master’ while you yourself are already an expert at this stage?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t want our relationship getting creepier than it already is,” Shira said, then he took out a pouch of coins. “Anyways, I got an errand from my aunt, so give me the thirteen dried spices worth all this money.”</p>\n<p>“What kind of spice?”</p>\n<p>“All kinds of spices.”</p>\n<p>“Of course, of course, I’ll give you a discount, just to celebrate your improvement in the path of drawing, Master.”</p>\n<p>By the time Shira got himself a basketful of spices, Monkey’s grin getting more annoying. The stereotypical fat and slimy merchants looked innocent compared to him. After Shira threw a frowning glance at him, he <em>reluctantly</em> admitted, “Young master may not know this, but recently I’ve got an Alchemist partner with me who was trying to be independent from his family,” he said. “And I must tell you, young master, this family is a many-hundreds of years Alchemists family, and you also must know he’s not kicked out of incompetente--”</p>\n<p>Shira cut his roundabout pitching. “You want me to back the Alchemist?”</p>\n<p>“Mmm...yes….” Monkey nodded with a wry smile.</p>\n<p>The boy’s eyes wandered through the peddler’s wares before looked at him in the eyes. “Even I must tread through the game of cat and dog with the elders because of the rules,” he explained to Monkey, who in turn, could only smile helplessly.</p>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>Mossack’s custom dictates children who haven’t gone through their coming of age ceremony--usually at the age of sixteen--to not being involved in politics and commerce. This is the reason why Shira--as he mostly acquired money winning through streaks of chess games with Good-Natured Spirit--couldn’t recklessly flaunt his personal wealth in public.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>The risk of having a relationship gone sour with this young master, Monkey knew that. It was unlikely for an upstart peddler to be relied on by a future patriarch of a big family, and he wholeheartedly believed it was unwise to create a trivial misunderstanding with Young Master Shira Yashura. After all, it was only one year until Shira would have his own coming of age ceremony. Therefore, Monkey didn’t want to impose on the Young Master’s kindness too much and quickly changed the topic with something he’d prepared beforehand.</p>\n<p>“This is a <b>Boost Elixir</b> concocted by my partner. He might not a 2nd-Tier Alchemist yet but I assure you, Young Master Shira, the elixir’s potent power won’t lose against any experts you’ll find anywhere!” Monkey said with his over-excited sales pitch, which made him look more funny than usual, “This humble bottle was scientifically proven to increase a person’s level as long as he is below the age of twenty! To date, this Boost Elixir has 100% effectiveness in increasing the user’s level! Young master, you are very lucky--you can have this miraculous elixir just for half of the original price today!”</p>\n<p>Though it was clear Monkey meant no harm, Shira narrowed his eyes at the pedder.</p>\n<p>“Did someone pay you to make me drink it?” he asked suspiciously.</p>\n<p>“You jest again, Young Master… ha ha… haaa….” Monkey awkwardly laughed as he tried to hide his dampened enthusiasm. “Why don’t you try it first, Young Master Shira. You don’t have to pay if you didn’t get to graduate from Level 3 Novice.”</p>\n<p>Eventually, Shira drank the Boost Elixir within a gulp, not because he believed its miraculous effect, but because he was weak for free and discounted goods.</p>\n<p>“Your EXP bar didn’t even budge a little,” Monkey muttered with a meek voice.</p>\n<p>“The liquid is surprisingly well made though. Is this really made by someone you know?”</p>\n<p>“I said before, Young Master. The one who made this hailed from an old Alchemist family that even outside South Tiramikal Kingdom their last name still can be a pretty big deal. I’m pretty confident that--normally--this elixir will have a 100% success rate for leveling up whoever drinks it!”</p>\n<p>“Such a confident boast. Are you perhaps implying that my case is not <em>normally</em>?”</p>\n<p>“He hehe, you surely joke. You know that I don’t mean any harm, young master.”</p>\n<p>Shira of course knew it. And the other thing he also knew, that if it was a really impressive elixir he just drank by now, the usual Monkey wouldn’t utter a single phrase of the word “free”, regardless how many times the elixir failed to deliver its promise.</p>\n<p>Shira looked at Monkey suspiciously, “You’re Monkey, aren’t you? Not someone brainwashed by my family’s enemy or something like that? You know, by vampires.”</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira… now your joke is not even funny--something like a poor peddler to be brainwashed only appears in stories. Vampires are some unfounded folklore.”</p>\n<p>“Monkey I know is stupid. If not brainwashed, then he definitely manipulated to sell a fake elixir to someone from big families.”</p>\n<p>Before Monkey was able to retort that, a cold voice came from the wagon. “Young Master Yashura, I don’t mind if you pinpoint Monkey’s stupidity and make assumptions about him muchever you want. But to call my elixir is fake, I can’t stand and watch around anymore.”</p>\n<p>A man appeared from the wagon Monkey had, had an appearance of the stereotypical scholar Shira had in mind--though, by the way he crossed his arms pompously, he seemed to have a pride worthy of someone hailed from big families.</p>\n<p>“You’re the Alchemist?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, you call me Snake--don’t ask for my real name,” the Alchemist said.</p>\n<p>One would hide his name if he didn’t want to be associated with his family anymore. So Shira didn’t ask. He looked at the scholarly Alchemist, then at the peddler. One was the Snake and the other one was the Monkey.</p>\n<p>Shira found some sort of strange camradice between them. “I see, so both of you decided to be a partner for life.”</p>\n<p>“Not for life, no. Spare me. It’s better for me to ditch this stupid ape as soon as he outlives his usefulness.”</p>\n<p>“Heey! Don’t say ditching in front of me!” Monkey protested. Snake ignored him without pretense, making the impression that this scene was ordinary for them.</p>\n<p>Shira then asked Snake straightforwardly.</p>\n<p>“What kind of elixir is this?”</p>\n<p>“Didn’t Monkey tell you? A Boost Elixir. My latest masterpiece,” Snake replied.</p>\n<p>“You’re aware that your partner tried to sell your masterpiece at a half price, right? I don’t even have to pay, it was what he said before.”</p>\n<p>“It was my idea,” Snake said. “This is a simple business hack. I’m confident about my concoctions. After all, I experimented heavily on human anatomy--too heavy, even, to the point folks in my family want me gone for good. I’ve got nothing to lose here. That bottle is a prototype; it cost a lot so I planned to price it a lot.”</p>\n<p>“You want to use my bad reputation as a stepping stone, don’t you?” Shira asked with a sour smile.</p>\n<p>“Yes. Do you mind?”</p>\n<p>“No, I’d gladly make profit out of those trash talking they did behind my back--though, it seems you picked the wrong guinea pig to be your mascot for your ‘business hack’,” Shira said with a wry smile.</p>\n<p>Monkey nodded weakly. As a peddler from outside the village, he was always bothered by how nasty rumors could be, especially with some acquaintance he depended on sometimes as an important business partner.</p>\n<p>Seeing that they no longer had things to chat about, Shira said to them he’d consider putting some resources if he managed to gain some nod from the family elders after he went through the coming-of-age ceremony next year. And now that he finished selling Good-Natured Spirit’s rejected commision and completed the errand his aunt gave him, Shira then bid farewell to the two animal-nicknamed gentlemen.</p>\n<p>“Please wait, Young Master Shira.”</p>\n<p>Shira turned back his head again and found Snake, the one who called him, ran back to Monkey’s wagon to grab something.</p>\n<p>“Try to drink this one,” Snake said after trotting back hurriedly. “It’s alright, you don’t have to pay for this time too.”</p>\n<p>The current elixir Snake took out was the exact opposite from the previous one. Its container was beautiful and high-class, but the content was muddy and very low in quality. Hearing that this one was also free, Shira didn’t hesitate to drink it.</p>\n<p>The after taste was incredibly sour. Unlike any other bitter concocted elixirs or potions he ever drank. Although not much, Shira could feel his body warming up. He was surprised at the unexpected reaction.</p>\n<p>“Oohhhh!!!” Monkey cried as his eyes glued at Shira’s Status Window. “The EXP bar moved!”</p>\n<p>“What?” the surprised Shira glanced at Snake and asked slowly, “This one’s free, right?”</p>\n<p>It was in a single flash Shira did catch a strange dumbfoundedness in Snake eyes, like the result even came more shocking than him than either of Shira and Monkey. Yet the moment after he promptly regained his stoic exposure, then said to Shira, “Don’t worry, I don’t plan to take back my words,”</p>\n<p>The odd Alchemist put his hands at his back and walked back to his wagon. Before he climbed the wagon, he once again glanced at Shira, looking in a state of half-disbelief like expression</p>\n<p>As Snake disappeared into the wagon, Shira and Monkey exchanged glances.</p>\n<p>“He still has that kind of face even though he promises it to be free? You sure do have an odd friend.” Shira said.</p>\n<p>Monkey grinned. “Though an oddball, I never seen anyone with more talent in alchemy than him, like, ever.”</p>\n<p>After leaving Monkey to continue his stall, Shira saw Good-Natured Spirit again when he visited a food stall not far from Monkey’s wagon. He asked what he was doing, and the Nalaq told him there was a fool who bet a lot and won a lot in the gambling games. To lose against in gambling against someone with Good-Natured Spirit’s caliber, really--Shira sighed--he couldn’t wait for his coming-of-age ceremony next year so he too could farm on these gullible people in some friendly matches--just like what he did with Good-Natured Spirit for this past one year.</p>\n<p>“You know,” munching on some satays he bought from the market, Shira muttered when he headed home along with Good-Natured Spirit, “just then I drank this elixir that really could boost my EXP a little. I don’t know how the guy concocts it, but I have the feeling that I just drink some very expensive elixir for free.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, yeah?”</p>\n<p>On the way back to Yashura Family Shira told the Nalaq spirit about the Alchemist and his elixirs. He also told him that his status that usually wouldn’t react to normal elixirs this time moved a bit after he drank a strange low-quality elixir.</p>\n<p>“That Alchemist must be a nerd to be that sharp,” Good-Natured Spirit said as he floated lazily beside the boy.</p>\n<p>“He looks like that too. The peddler he partnered with also has some good sense in him. So I thought it’s not a loss for me to use all those foreign coins I got from you to invest on them for the next year.”</p>\n<p>“Hmm,” Good-Natured Spirit crossed his arms. “I think you should be worried.”</p>\n<p>“Worried? Why?”</p>\n<p>“You said that nerd Alchemist was the one who pushed that low-quality elixir to you, right?”</p>\n<p>“I got to drink that for free,” Shira emphasized.</p>\n<p>“He realized one little secret about you then,” Good-Natured Spirit said.</p>\n<p>Shira stopped walking. He looked at him with his head tilted.</p>\n<p>“What secret?”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit who floated before, spoke again.</p>\n<p>“You shouldn’t worry about it too much for now, brat. But, I advise you, if you are still holding dear for your lazy, peaceful village life, you should turn back and kill him right now.”</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-4/chapter-3-5":"<p>What the Nalaq told Shira lingered in his mind. Good-Natured Spirit blurted something about killing someone as if it was something trivial that could popped out easily in normal conversation. To kill someone after finding out his secret--what kind of secret he needed to protect anyway? A secret he never wanted people to know the fact he was drawing semi-porns for money. But he wasn’t that insecure to kill someone over a petty secret like that? That would be him being not right in the head. The more he thought about Good-Natured Spirit’s remark, the more it disturbed him. Especially right now, when his hands painted in red, bathed in blood. When he just did an act of actual killing.</p>\n<p>“Something on your mind, Young Master Shira?” a rough voice disturbed his train of thought.</p>\n<p>“Ah,” Shira looked at a burly man, an experienced hunter, who called him.</p>\n<p>The man’s body even drenched in thicker blood than him. One would get easily nauseated by the sight of it. Yet it didn’t make the boy flinched, as he was expecting the experience for a few months already.</p>\n<p>“Here. Look at his gut. Spilling out his innards with your own hands might be a good experience for you, young master.”</p>\n<p>The hunter spun a sharp dagger, holding it by the tip of its blade, having a gesture of offering it to his young master.</p>\n<p>“Is that okay? I even had trouble when skinning the hide,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>He’d rather not, to be honest, since splitting a goat’s gut could be messy if he did it crudely. Even if he was the young master of the family, when messing with the raw meat, not even his uncle could save him from the aunties’ nagging. Shira Yashura was nearly sixteen, almost reaching adulthood, so he had to participate in butchering goats; it was a quite tasking task, but was easy enough compared to butchering cows he had to do in a few years. But for the fifteen years old young master, getting the hang of the butchering knife’s handle was plenty of experience already for him.</p>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>As the custom dictates, every month in ngajen ceremony preparation, the boys will have to deal with cows and goats while the girls help aunties plucking chickens’ and ducks’ feathers. Whether the gatekeepers' children or the family’s next heirs, all of them are required to do it every time a major ceremony approaches.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>After doing his part in butchering a goat Shira immediately took a bath to remove the bloody pungent. On a whim he then strolled to the kitchen to grab some snacks. There he witnessed how all the coconuts he and his uncle shred already transformed into delicious foods; rendang, Bulayak satay, coconut satay, spicy curry, many other mouth drolling coconut cuisines. The coconut loving uncle was all smiles and gave him a big portion of the famous beef cuisine the locals called rendang--which, normally, even for a young master like Shira would get to eat rendang once every few months. But with enough wit and experience in currying favor with his uncle, he got to taste those delicious food handed down by his uncle, the Chief Chef, personally.</p>\n<p>“Shira my boy,” Patriarch Shuro said to his nephew who was squatting below the shadow of a thick pillar, happily munching on his rendang, “you’re going to visit Malikh Family tonight. Keep a good check on your cousin. Don’t embarrass Yashura Family and present our rendang_ _for their main family.”</p>\n<p>“Sure.”</p>\n<hr>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>Domesticated cows were less in numbers than goats in Badril Village, so meals from cows, not including the innards which could be made into popular but cheap cuisines, like only served for village big shots or important visitors during the ngajen ceremony.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>Laughters and chatters made the night more merry than any other thay of the month. It was brighter than usual, as villagers came out of their house to set up big braziers to light the road between the families that were holding festives. From one hundred meters away, through the thick wall of the big families, the mouth-watering aroma of prepared food wafted through the air as if they informally invited people to come and to taste the delicacy these big families had. The change in scenery upon the arrival of the night signaled the nigh of Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>Yashura Family, the oldest family around, was known to have the best food amongst all families in Badril Village, while Elzhier Family known as the family that always threw the biggest party post-ceremony--Elzhier Family’s maidservants were beautiful and they’d show off their voluptuous bodies every single ngajen ceremony. Particularly this month however, everyone was anticipating the ceremony thrown by Malikh Family; for two years since the young lady’s absence they threw nothing more than mediocre festivities, her return was to be seen as their revival on the village’s political stage. And from how big their arrangement looked like, it seemed Malikh Family didn’t plan to fail everyone’s expectations.</p>\n<p>Shira Yashura wore the same suit he got from his uncle on his fifteenth birthday. It was the usual suit he’d wear whenever a ceremony was held. His uncle bought it from a merchant who had connections outside the kingdom, which was pretty good since the fabric wasn’t stiff, but could get unbearably itchy in places he didn’t want to scratch whenever there were people around. The obvious part missing from the wears his peers were wearing was beast pelts.</p>\n<p>Pelts from ferocious beasts were known for irrefutable proof for boys’ courage and manliness. As many young gentlemen of Badril Village wore on their necks, always looking for the opportunity to show off the trophy of their preys to girls--which translated as fashionable fads for boys who wanted to get laids.</p>\n<p>Of course, Shira, as part of the dull and no-nonsense camp of the boys in Badril Village, never had participated in that kind of indecent business. He was so dull that the only girl who would accompany him to attend ceremonies was his cousin Mila--who, even though her face was quite pretty, also happened to be in terrible luck for romance.</p>\n<p>“No matter how many times I see it, it’s always impressive to see how fast you wrap all these banana leaves,” Shira commented as he watched how Mila wrapped rendang with banana leaves. She was very good at it, comparable to the aunties’ skills that had been forged day and night in the family’s kitchen.</p>\n<p>“You talking? You’ve done your training with the family's sword technique, I assume?” Mila said with her lips pouted. Shira thought it was unusual for Mila didn’t nag her mouth off immediately when she saw him. He saw a sword wrapped in cloth near Mila. His face immediately twisted in a troubled look.</p>\n<p>“I won’t bring that thing,” he protested.</p>\n<p>“You--” Mila hissed.</p>\n<p>“What should I do with a sword inside another family’s ceremony?” Shira said. The sword was his father’s, and that was his reason he didn’t want to use it. “Look, I can only draw the blade from the sheath at most. Without a proper amount of Strength attribute I can’t swing this properly. It rejects my mana. I’d make a fool out of myself if that happened.”</p>\n<p>“That’s because you were stupidly increasing your Wisdom instead of, that’s why you--arghh! Just forget about it! I know you’re trying to make excuses! Since you’re so weak all we can do is flaunting around your father’s reputation. We’ve got to remind people that our Yashura Family’s not to mess with. Here, just slip this fucking sword in your belt.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, this is embarrassing. Those rumors are about to get worse tonight,” Shira said with a sigh. His reputation as a trash talent was annoying enough, added this shameless act of throwing his weight around, he’d become more reluctant to show his face in the public later on. But still he unwillingly slipped the sword in his belt.</p>\n<p>Mila snorted. She ignored the complaint. Right now she could care less about the rumors about her cousin. What she had to prioritize tonight was the bad premonition she had about Bhela Malikh’s short hair--nobody believed her when she said that Bhela was being a slut for cutting her hair short in spite of her being in an engagement. While her hands craftly knotted the rendang wrapped in banana leaves with a rope made with dried coconut leaves, she suddenly had a cold smile; the image of those impudent Malikhs shuddering under the famous sword of Yashura Family’s Unique Class, Jhuro Yashura the Blackfang Swordsman, entertained her she began to chuckle coldly.</p>\n<p>“Huhuhu… just you wait you bitch…”</p>\n<p>Shira stepped back. He had the hunch he should keep a distance away from his current cousin right now.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Every month, for every family in Badril Village, cooking during the Ngajen Ceremony was always a time rushing hectic. Even more in Malikh Family this time. Since the amount of food they had to deliver before the ceremony started more than twice the amount they made last month, most of the aunties in duty were cooking outdoors. The smoke from the half-dried firewood would be too unbearable for the eyes if all of them cooked in one cramped place. Fortunately, most of the dishes were already cooked and sent to the courtyard, so the only people who were still on duty preparing food were a small number of aunties and maidservants.</p>\n<p>The young maidservants were pale from tiredness but they couldn’t afford to slack in this one Ngajen Ceremony. The usual noisy aunties, they didn’t even show a sign of wanting to rest. Nobody could beat the resilience of the kitchen-duty armies when it came to preparing for a loadful of party’s foods.</p>\n<p>Usually, the one who would supervise these spartan cooking aunties would be the patriarch’s wife, Bhela’s mother. It was already a long-held tradition in the village for the patriarch to cook for the family’s important guests as the Chief Chef, while the wife supported him by supervising the aunties and maidservants. In Ngajen Ceremony this month, however, Bhela’s mother holed herself to accompany the husband on his ill-bed.</p>\n<p>She was not in the mood to meet with people. So Bhela stepped in to fill her position.</p>\n<p>Back when she was little Bhela often followed her mother working during the ngajen ceremony, she knew what she had to do by the back of her hand. In usage of salt, for example, she knew down to the tiniest detail of how much salt should be applied to different kinds of cuisines. She also instructed the inexperienced maidservants who were in charge of cooking side dishes so the overall quality of the feast would be balanced. Bhela Malikh didn’t betray everyone’s expectations about her. She did her work splendidly.</p>\n<p>However, there was a matter she saw that didn’t make her happy. The largest furnace that was usually reserved for the Chief Chef, today was used by an old man from the outer family. A great cook, the old man was. Known for his vast experience in handling the family’s food stalls for years. The problem was his common status. Without at least an elder status made it awkward for him to cook as the Chief Chef in this kitchen, even if he was a mere proxy. Bhela wondered whether the one who took the charge when her parents were unavailable knew the risk of being laughed at and criticized by the other two big families--especially now that the relationship between Yashura and Malikh wasn’t that good like before.</p>\n<p>“Young lady, the day’s getting dark, you should take a bath now and prepare yourself for the ceremony,” an aunty said to Bhela.</p>\n<p>“Yes, young lady is no longer a little girl, so making you pretty will take a while,” an early twenty maidservant added from the side. She continued, “The new girls should be able to complete the foods since you directed them a lot. Please don’t worry about us.”</p>\n<p>“I’m relieved to hear that,” Bhela said. Not yet three seconds later her eyes wandered to the old cook again. She couldn’t hide her frown.</p>\n<p>“Something the matter, Young Lady Bhela?”</p>\n<p>“Yes. Maybe it’s a misunderstanding on my part but… I can’t see the elder who would substitute my father as the Chief Chef.”</p>\n<p>Hearing Bhela said her concern, the aunties and the maidservants averted eyes with their young lady with troubled faces. Bhela then understood there was something shady going on.</p>\n<p>Her suspicion turned worse when she saw a young man in his twenties leading four manservants with him. When the aunties were working in the kitchen, it was an unspoken rule for unrelated adult men not to approach, but the battle-hardened aunties that normally were ferocious in defending their territories were all silent in welcoming the cocky visitors. It wasn’t surprising to Bhela that all of them came from Elder Jhamil’s faction.</p>\n<p>“Why aren’t you ready yet, old worm?!”</p>\n<p>“I am sorry, young elder… some dish cannot be rushed so I prepared some to--”</p>\n<p><em>Slap!!</em></p>\n<p>The slapping sound echoed in the kitchen. The room descended into a dead silent. The old cook was trembling; he lowered his head and covered the cheek that just got slapped but everyone could see the blood on the corner of his mouth. Bhela recollected her memory, and finally remembered the arrogant young man was actually Elder Jhamil’s own son.</p>\n<p>“Shit!” Elder Jhamil’s son swore, “those councils from Village Hall came. We must complete the set before too long! Those people are the ones who usually have the heaviest voice when valuing Ngajen Ceremony dishes!”</p>\n<p>One follower quipped, “Young elder is right. This old worm can’t cook shit! If this goes on, the only things the Village Hall council will remember about Elder Jhamil’s cooking is that we Malikhs cook as slow as snail!”</p>\n<p>The frown on Bhela’s face became deeper. Young elder? Before she went out for the seminars that lasted two years, this man, son of Elder Jhamil, merely a family member with a post within the family’s business. And something else that disturbed her was how she couldn’t see how the blurted about Elder Jhamil’s cooking, the one who worked in the kitchen all day, didn’t see the said elder even once today.</p>\n<p>Bhela still held her silent. But her eyes were cold and sharp judging people and the situation. The aunties and the maidservants, though they looked sympathetic with the old man, were afraid to go against Elder Jhamil’s son. Maybe because the lack of resistance Elder Jhamil’s son dared to do a taboo known in the kitchen--swapping food that wrapped in banana leaves with ceramic plates, garnished a bit, and called it the Chief Chef’s cuisine.</p>\n<p>“No, young elder!” a brave middle-aged aunty stepped forward, “you can’t do that!”</p>\n<p>“Why not?” one follower sneered in Elder Jhamil’s son’s place. “This one also got beef, isn’t it? We need to quickly serve the Chief Chef cuisine to the people from Village Hall councils.”</p>\n<p>“Exactly because they are from the Village Hall council--just from inferior cuts of the beef they’d know the dishes have been swapped! You’ll tarnish Malikh Family’s honor if people knew you were fooling--”</p>\n<p>“Fooling?!” Elder Jhamil roared.</p>\n<p>The young elder raised his hand, though the aunty who complained quickly hid back behind the maidservants. Elder Jhamil’s son then rampaged into a series of barking, yelling and threatening the aunties to cut their salary just because his mood was spoiled.</p>\n<p>His words scared all the girls and the women inside the kitchen. All except Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>After they were done swapping the foods, the young elder led his men out of the kitchen with great swagger. The young elder stopped at the door, turned around, and gave the old cook one last ultimatum: “There’ll be a noble in the ceremony so we need rendang for the main course. So go make it, old worm. You know what’s gonna happen if you couldn’t deliver, don’t you?”</p>\n<p>The old man trembled. Even the eyes on the aunties couldn’t help but shake at the threat. There was now way they could prepare rendang with only two hours remaining until the Ngajen Ceremony started.</p>\n<p>After that situation calmed down. The aunties and the maidservants went back to work. Some of them still exchanged whispered and gossiped amongst themselves. But when Bhela approached, immediately they stopped and pretended nothing happened.</p>\n<p>“Young lady…” a pudgy aunty came to her, the one who stood up against the young elder from before.</p>\n<p>“Aunty?”</p>\n<p>“We are sorry… we’ve had no meaning to show you that embarrassing scene.”</p>\n<p>Bhela shook her head. “No, I’m one from the main family bloodline; I should've been the one who stood up to him instead of hiding behind everyone.”</p>\n<p>The aunty knew the young lady didn’t say a word before because the girl wanted to know the situation. Some other middle-aged aunties who were close with Madam Malikh also knew more or less Bhela’s detached wait-and-see attitude, so no one really would blame her even if she didn’t say a word before--especially since she had just returned from overseas. The pudgy aunty tugged on Bhela’s sleeve, whispered to her ear, “Young Lady Bhela, we know you’re concerned. But we’ve already gotten used to it. You’re still young. Your future is brighter than everyone else in the family, Young Lady Bhela. It’s better to endure than pointlessly making enemies.”</p>\n<p>“This isn’t pointless,” Bhela said. She then grabbed the nearest apron and wore it. Her father was the patriarch. And she wasn’t a poster girl to draw everyone’s attention to the family.</p>\n<p>The pudgy aunty wanted to say something again. But words stuck on her throat, she closed her mouth as soon as she opened it.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the old man began to pick some mature coconut and shredded it listlessly. He got more than four decades of handling food stalls for Malikh Family, he wasn’t a stranger at cooking rendang. But he already gave up on finishing one for tonight’s Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>“Uncle, I’ll take it from here,” Bhela said as she approached the weary old man.</p>\n<p>“Ahh, yes?” the old man was started. The girl came with an apron and common garment, had fair and beautiful skin, as well clear and articulate voice; a maidservant from the inner family was the first one that came to his mind. But only when he noticed even the aunties were respectful to her and her striking bob-cut short hair that the old man began drenched in cold sweat.</p>\n<p>“I said, uncle,” Bhela repeated, “I’ll take it from here. You can rest now.”</p>\n<p>The old man vigorously shook his head.</p>\n<p>“Please Young Lady Bhela… please spare this old bone….”</p>\n<p>“This is originally my father’s post, uncle. You’ll have to be at least an elder and write your name in council’s ledger to be a substitute for my father.”</p>\n<p>The old man wanted to break into a tearless cry. This is worse than when he faced Elder Jhamil’s son's harassment before. The most thing he was afraid of was the news of Elder Jhamil using him as Chief Chef behind the scene to reach the ears of the main family. And now that Bhela Malikh was here, there was nothing he could do but to resign his life to fate.</p>\n<p>“Y-young lady!” a maidservant yelled, “you can’t!”</p>\n<p>“Who says I can’t?” Bhela asked sharply.</p>\n<p>An aunty, who had a stern-looking face, said, “You can’t cook for the main course, young lady. In case of a patriarch's absence, usually one of the elders who’s going to take his place. There’s no rule saying it’s okay for women to do it.”</p>\n<p>“Then, I’m going to ask,” from the aunty, Bhela threw her glance toward the old man, “are you an elder cooking here to substitute my father as a cook, uncle?”</p>\n<p>The old man’s face turned pale. Whichever the answer of that question would lead him to the road of punishment. All of the sudden, he became a mute.</p>\n<p>Because she had the most standing, nobody made a sound when Young Lady Bhela Malikh asked them to fetch chickens and spices for her.</p>\n<p>Not long after, the story about how the Young Lady of Malikh Family wanted to substitute her father spread like a wildfire. Never in Badril Village’s history would a young lady do that. A crowd of curious males, mostly the youngsters from main and outer of Malikh Family, surrounded the kitchen as they wanted to catch a glimpse of how their beautiful young lady recklessly challenged the custom by her own. The boys sighed in admiration. Bhela Malikh was essentially an Archer at heart. But the way she handled a blade, even if it was a kitchen knife, was skillful and graceful, as every time her slim wrist stopped moving from cutting down a vegetable, a wave of gulping could be heard. The boys couldn’t take their eyes from her. The reckless and brave young lady was simply too charming.</p>\n<p>“Did you know that foreigners often confuse rendang as dried curry?” Bhela said to one maidservant who stared at the way she cooked. “Curry leaves originated from an area close to western Haldeen lands, so many local Mossacks sailed the sea to try their luck making it big working for western empires.”</p>\n<p>The usual aloof Bhela unusually was talkative when she was cooking, which was quite a big surprise for people who were watching. She explained to the clueless maidservants how, during her two years travelling in seminars from countries to countries, found many noble owned restaurants claimed to serve rendang but turned out to be dried curry. All the while sharply focused on doing her cooking duty.</p>\n<p>“Young lady!” from the crowd came out an angry bald man. He was Elder Jhamil. “W-what are you doing there?”</p>\n<p>“I’m cooking,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“But you can’t work there!” Elder Jhamil yelled. “No woman can substitute for patriarch! That’s against the rule!”</p>\n<p>“I don’t recall we have a rule like that.”</p>\n<p>“If you know why you still stand there?”</p>\n<p>“Neither do I recall a rule for an elder to use a stand-in for the Chief Chef position.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s face turned weird as if he suddenly got constipated. Many of the youngsters didn’t catch Bhela’s remarks nor they cared too much about it, but some in the crowd were nodding knowingly, as many of them were familiar with how shady Elder Jhamil was doing things.</p>\n<p>As the bald elder’s head was racing fast looking for an answer to defuse the young lady’s claim, suddenly, a loud roar exploded behind him.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela, who do you think you are? Just because your father is the family’s patriarch you think you can do whatever you want?!”</p>\n<p>The faces of aunties and the maidservants twitched. They witnessed how the young elder harassed the old man before, so they were itching to throw back the same question at him instead, though no more brave aunties dared to cause more troubles.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s son continued, “The ingredient for making Chief dishes takes money, young lady. Not even the patriarch himself has the daring to use coins from the treasury for himself. Do you want to embarrass your parents that much?”</p>\n<p>“I’m not making this food for myself nor I cook for my father. It’s for the guests. And I provided the spices and the foreign curry leaves by myself,” Bhela said. Some maidservants behind her nodded nervously as Bhela indeed ordered them to fetch spices from the personal kitchen in the main family’s residential area.</p>\n<p>In spite of that, the young elder kept pushing on with nasty smile on his face.</p>\n<p>“What about the chicken, young lady? They cost money! What do you say about that, huh?”</p>\n<p>Behind Bhela, the aunties, even the maidservants, were whispering at each other on how ridiculous it was to question the sole young generation of Malikh Family main bloodline over some chickens. Even Bhela, the young lady in question, would only glanced at the troubled expression of Elder Jhamil.</p>\n<p>“I will pay for the chicken,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Ha? Pay? With what? Your father’s money? Can’t a sick person even pay the cost of the foods for ngajen ceremony all by himself?”</p>\n<p>“No need to bring my father’s name here.” Bhela said with a dangerously cold tone.</p>\n<p>The chillness in her eyes was telling that she really did hate people bringing her parents’ name in bad faith. After hearing gasps of surprise from people that didn’t expect the usually silent young lady could utter something with such a biting tone, she sighed, said with an explanation, “I got a dress as a gift from a certain person who has too much money in his pocket. He said the dress is so valuable even the princesses wear them in parties. It should cover the cost of these chickens I’m going to cook if I sell the dress right here right now.”</p>\n<p>Bhela then tilted her head and glanced at the bald elder.</p>\n<p>“Am I right, Elder Jhamil?”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil wanted to maintain his smile, but his face went stiff as stone. He was trembling inside for knowing that the dress he acquired with a large sum of money and with his best connection, valued the same as some mere village chickens in Bhela’s eyes.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, his son, who was taken aback for a bit from the cold remark Bhela had said earlier, recovered, began to yell again, “Ha! Did you not train your brain when you were overseas, my young lady? The same dress princesses wear in parties? Only someone dumb believe that! Hah! Obviously you’ve been lied to! You’ve been crooked, young lady, crooked--”</p>\n<p><em>Paak!</em></p>\n<p>From behind, the already red-faced Elder Jhamil smacked his son’s head. “You’ve been rude to Young Lady Bhela, you dumbskull! You have to apologize! Young lady can’t bear to hear it anymore!”</p>\n<p>While in fact it was him who couldn’t bear to hear being called a crook.</p>\n<p>“Apologize!” Elder Jhamil roared.</p>\n<p><em>Splash!</em></p>\n<p>The pair father and son’s performance didn’t amuse Bhela, however. With the lid in her hand, Bhela scooped boiling curry broth and splashed it to their direction. Surprised, the stupid young elder swore with nasty words while his father cried in high-pitched voice.</p>\n<p>“Please get out,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil laughed wryly.</p>\n<p>“Please don’t be like that, young lady. I know my son doesn't have the best education but--”</p>\n<p><em>Splash!!</em></p>\n<p>Bhela waved the cooking lid once again as soon as Elder Jhamil stepped forward. The hot water splashed on his expensive boots. This time, while he didn’t expect for Bhela splashing hot water at him again, he wasn’t freaking out. It seemed his plan to make the young lady behave a little backfiring instead. His face turned solemn.</p>\n<p>“Young lady…”</p>\n<p>“I’m not going to say it thrice--everyone who has nothing to do in the kitchen, please get out,” Bhela said. “Or else--”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The major families’ lands were astonishingly spacious and complex, their walls were thick and tall, therefore each of them employed a few stationary guards for the main gate as gatekeepers. These gatekeepers, though usually filled by members of the outer part of the families, their duty were significantly more important than others since they represented the face of the family they served. So they always maintain polite gestures to everyone who came through their gate, either commoners or rich people from big families. Yet when Shira and Mila arrived the Malikh Family’s gatekeepers didn’t even hide their scoffs.</p>\n<p>“Ridiculous!” she hissed with a face boiled in anger, “even lowly gatekeepers are looking down on us!”</p>\n<p>“Don’t bother with them,” Shira said. Unlike his cousin’s furious temper, his flair seemed like he shrugged the blatant disrespect, as the holder of “Eternal Novice” title he was already numb by how people were talking behind his back.</p>\n<p>“If your father was here they’d bow their asses as soon as they saw us Yashura coming.”</p>\n<p>Shira shrugged his shoulders again.</p>\n<p>Still seething in anger, Mila cast her eyes on the banana leaves wrapped food in Shira’s hands. “Who should we give the rendang to?” she asked.</p>\n<p>“Let’s just give it to a random servant.” Then Shira called a maidservant who was carrying a tray full of food. “Excuse me!”</p>\n<p>“Yes? What can I help y--” The moment this maidservant turned her head and saw Shira’s face, she immediately threw back her eyes and escaped with hurried trot, pretending she saw nothing.</p>\n<p>“The fuck?!” Mila was flastergabbed, didn’t know what to say.</p>\n<p>Later on Shira and Mila realized how unpopular Yashura Family was to the current Malikhs, even the servants who usually held no voice in the family were avoiding the pair of cousins like plague. Their attitude especially worsened when it came to Shira Yashura.</p>\n<p>“Look there,” someone whispered amongst the guests, “Yashura Family send their eldest young miss and the young master! Out of all the Ngajen Ceremony, they choose tonight to show their faces--pretty obvious, eh? Bet they’re drooling to get another Unique Class after knowing our Young Lady Bhela’s real talent tonight!”</p>\n<p>Someone else agreed and replied, “With that kind of trash as their young master, they’d be dreamin’ to get even a touch of our Young Lady Bhela. Pueh!”</p>\n<p>Hearing the muffled disdain, Mila Yashura whirled her body, glaring people with eagle eyes. “Who said that?!” she growled.</p>\n<p>“Mila…” Shira held her shoulder.</p>\n<p>“The fuckers don’t even put our Yashura Family in their eyes. Just because shitty rumors about Unique Class they started to feel high and mighty, eh?”</p>\n<p>“Just let go, Uncle Shuro didn’t send us here to start troubles,” Shira said. “All we need to do is to show our faces here and give them our rendang. It’s not our problem whether they welcome our good intention with grace or not.”</p>\n<p>Though Shira said that, he secretly hoped Malikh Family would grow too proud to receive it--all so he had an excuse to keep his uncle’s rendang for himself.</p>\n<p>A commotion arose. People hussing here and there with excitement. When Shira and Mila wanted to know what was going on, a parade of beautiful young women glittering and stealing the whole show came from inside of Malikh Family’s hall. Leading them was a short-haired young beauty, face as icy as an ice sculpture, the recent name that everyone had been talking about these days, Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>It was clear from the way Bhela positioned herself she represented the family as the ceremony’s Chief Chef.</p>\n<p>“Whoa, so Malikh Family let her do that,” Shira murmured.</p>\n<p>Not to mention being the Chief Chef--the most Shira did in his family’s kitchen was helping his uncle, helping him shred coconuts. They were at the same age, but the same old Shira still practiced butchering goats while the supposed fiancée of his was climbing the social ladder. Even Mila was angry by the special treatment Malikh Family gave to their young lady.</p>\n<p>“Sup, young master!” from behind a voice called him.</p>\n<p>Shira turned around, found the one who greeted him was Monkey.</p>\n<p>“Who?” Mila asked Shira as the stranger with a monkey-like face approaching.</p>\n<p>“This one is called by the name of Monkey, young lady,” Monkey, with his self-trained Mossack’s style bowing gesture, introduced himself smoothly.</p>\n<p>Mila hummed in ackwnoledgement. It was harder to forget than remembering someone with such combination of face and awkward name.</p>\n<p>“Mister Monkey, I thought you’ll spend the ceremony to show Mister Snake around since he’s an outsider. What are you doing in Malikh Family?” Shira asked.</p>\n<p>“Now, now, please drop the ‘Mister’, young master. I’m not that old yet to be called as such,” Monkey said, then he continued explaining his story this evening. “We were planning to go to your family’s ceremony, young master. But who would have thought Snake to meet with his relatives here? His relatives are actually Malikh Family’s guests for tonight’s Ngajen Ceremony. Bet he got to eat expensive cuisines right now.”</p>\n<p>“Well, it’ll be easier with Mister Snake here. I’ve got some coins I want to show you, I wonder if it works to use them for--” Shira sneakily glanced at his cousin, then turned back to Monkey like it was nothing, “--for the thing we talked about yesterday.”</p>\n<p>Mila sneered, “You have some business to attend, no?”</p>\n<p>“Not really, no,” Shira shrugged off her question.</p>\n<p>“Really, though?” Mila crossed her arms, sneered again. “I think I saw Romana just now. I’mma chat with her a little bit.”</p>\n<p>It seemed to Shira that his cousin meeting with Romana here, in Malikh Family’s Ngajen Ceremony, wasn’t simply to have fun. He didn’t like his cousin would make trouble but he didn’t want to spend the whole night with her either. “Don’t go home without me,” he said eventually.</p>\n<p>“Hmph! You’re not a kid anymore but still need me to accompany you home?”</p>\n<p>No, Shira actually was more worried about her than himself.</p>\n<p>He then glanced beside and said, “Mister Monkey.”</p>\n<p>“Just Monkey,” Monkey corrected.</p>\n<p>“Mister Just Monkey, you said Mister Snake with relative? And his relatives are Malikh Family’s guests?”</p>\n<p>“Not Just Mon--ah, forget about it,” Monkey already gave up guessing whether Young Master Shira Yashura was purposely pulling his leg or not. “They really were Malikh Family’s guests, they even got the front row for the prayer and all.”</p>\n<p>“Is hard for us to be friendly if Mister Snake is involved with Malikh Family.”</p>\n<p>“You mean, that, huh? Well, I’ve been here for a while and they talked about you a lot, so I guess even someone as chill as you can get angry sometimes. But you don’t have to worry about those Malikhs, Young Master Shira. As long as their patriarch is Ghalim Malikh they won’t sever ties with Yashura so easily.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, is this your opinion?”</p>\n<p>“It’s Snake’s. It’s what he said before he met his relatives.”</p>\n<p>Shira thought the Alchemist he met once before was a total stranger of Badril Village, but it appeared he was wrong. “He really does know about Malikh Family that much, doesn’t he?”</p>\n<p>“Well, yeah, but I think he’s more familiar with Yashura than Malikh Family, though,” Monkey said, crossing his arms and nodded to himself as he recalled things that Snake told him to get his wares supported by Yashura Family; for example, obtaining Butler Yulong’s permission the same as Patriarch Shuro Yashura’s, Snake once said.</p>\n<p>“What? Why do you make that kind of face, Young Master Shira?” Monkey was snapped from his train of thought.</p>\n<p>“Ah, no, I just don’t expect you’re going to say some like that.”</p>\n<p>“What are you saying, young master. In the first place, Snake became my crew because he heard I’ve some dealing with Yashura Family.”</p>\n<p>Shira did recall the first time Monkey contacted Yashura Family--through him. To be more exact, the first item Monkey dealt from Malikh Family was Shira’s smuggled erotic painting that Good-Natured Spirit rejected.</p>\n<p>“--Speaking of Snake,” with his thumb Monkey did point in a certain direction. The place was separated from the common guest as they indeed were Malikh Family’s special guests. Shira’s eyes followed and he saw the familiar Alchemist he knew not long ago, Snake, was talking with two men, young and old, most likely brother and his grandfather.</p>\n<p>“Don’t be fooled by their appearances, young master. They’re renowned experts,” Monkey said.</p>\n<p>The pair of brother and grandfather wore worn out pale robes as their clothes, unlike the image of revered experts in Shira’s mind. Monkey told him both likely to travel incognito for various reasons. The old man had an old white hair and long beard, his back crooked and had to bring a walking staff to support himself, and gave people the impression of a sleepy grandpa from the dim light on his eyes. The young one though, had an always angry-looking face with fierce brows, crossing his muscle-thick arms, locked in a debate with Snake. Snake’s face was notably paler than when Shira met him in the market.</p>\n<p>“We can’t greet Mister Snake now, can we?” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think we can,” Monkey said. Even though he long considered Snake as his partner, the two guests appearing incognito were still the main members of the revered Alchemist family. This was no time for commoners like him acting friendly on them all of the sudden.</p>\n<p>The sleepy-looking old man, noticing two pairs of eyes looking at him, he raised his head. He caught the sight of Shira. Their eyes met.</p>\n<p>“Oh ho,” the old man smiled when he found the boy. He dragged his old body to approach the flastergabbed Shira and Monkey.</p>\n<p>Even Monkey who knew more about them wouldn’t expect Snake’s relatives to introduce themselves first.</p>\n<p>“He’s heading this way…”</p>\n<p>“Ah, yes, apparently.”</p>\n<p>Monkey gulped. “It’s different with Snake. Although he looked like that, whatever you do, please, young master, you can’t afford to be rude in front of this elder…”</p>\n<p>From the nervousness in Monkey’s voice Shira found the approaching old man seemed to hail from a more prestigious family than he originally thought.</p>\n<p>“Greeting, elder,” Shira said with his head humbly lowered as soon as he approached.</p>\n<p>The old man chuckled, patted Shira’s head, said, “Ah, Young Master, look how much you’ve grown. It feels like only yesterday how happy you were running around like a little kid you are.”</p>\n<p>Shira nodded hearing that. He glanced beside him, and caught Monkey’s face flabbergasted looking both at the boy and the old man.</p>\n<p>Hiding his embarrassment behind a fake cough, Shira then tried to understand whether the old man mistook him for someone else. “I’m sorry, elder. I don’t know if I’m mistaken, but, have we met before?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, have we met? Of course we’ve--” he stopped. The old man's eyes were covered by a pair of soft hands of a girl.</p>\n<p>“Guess who this is?” the girl who sneakily teased the old man from behind was grinning.</p>\n<p>“Oho! Who is this? Who is this?” the old man smiled delightedly.</p>\n<p>Both Shira and Monkey were tense watching the scene before them. Especially Shira Yashura, who knew that the grin on his cousin’s face always told that the girl enjoyed herself a little bit too much.</p>\n<p>“Isn’t this… Tomboy Princess?” the old man guessed.</p>\n<p>“Tuut! Wrong!”</p>\n<p>Mila released her hands. When the old man turned to see the preparator, he exclaimed with a chuckle.</p>\n<p>“It’s really you, Tomboy Princess.”</p>\n<p>Mila excitedly echoed, “It’s really you, Grandpa Piss!”</p>\n<p>They were so glad they met after a long time that they started to hug each other. Then Mila pull herself from the oldman’s embrace, yelling, “Ugghh…” she pinched her nose, “I smell something pissy around here.”</p>\n<p>Just when Shira and Monkey wondered what Mila meant by that, the girl looked at the old man, saying, “It’s no wonder it smells pissy. Have you taken a bath, Grandpa Piss.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss answered with a laugh. But Shira and Monkey facepalmed.</p>\n<p>So much for being mindful in front of the revered old expert.</p>\n<p>Shira awkwardly smiled to cover his shame. “Mila, you should be mindful in front of elders.”</p>\n<p>“Mindful?” Mila gasped. “In front of Grandpa Piss? Why?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, it’s okay, young master,” the old man said as he waved his hand. “I’m not that old to lose my sense of humor. Yashura Family’s princess sure is as naughty as always.” His wrinkles deepened as he curled his lips into a big smile. He said to Mila, “I reckon Patriarch Shuro’s been well, my princess? I recall he got a lot of migraines back in the day.”</p>\n<p>Haughtily, Mila replied, “Don’t worry about that guy, Grandpa Piss. His brain capacity has been declining these past years so there’s really nothing left inside to give him any headache!”</p>\n<p>“Ehem,” Shira cleared his phlegm. “She meant our patriarch has been well, elder.”</p>\n<p>“That’s what I said,” Mila laughed, and the old man laughed too. After that Mila kissed Grandpa Piss’s right hand as if she was kissing an elder’s hand from her own family, then continued laughing as cheeky as always.</p>\n<p>“My naughty princess,” Grandpa Piss ruffled Mila’s hair, “I planned to visit Yashura Family later. But since we’ve already met, here, please take this.”</p>\n<p>Receiving a pack wrapped in dried leaves, Mila pouted her lips. “You wouldn’t be lying about this being a candy again, would you?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, of course not.”</p>\n<p>As far as her memory served her well, what Grandpa Piss called candy actually a really bitter herb for young children to gain their appetite. Mila sniffed. She opened it and have a little taste. “Uuueeekk!”</p>\n<p>It was sour and even more bitter than she remembered. “What the hell is this?!”</p>\n<p>“That herb’s not for consumption, Young Lady Mila” the big man with muscles, Snake’s big brother, said from behind Grandpa Piss. He was smiling politely despite the other party merely a young lady of a rural village. “It’s a cosmetic for skin care.”</p>\n<p>“Skin care?!”</p>\n<p>Mila’s mouth widened agape. But soon as she glanced at the muscle man who was approaching her, she became wary, leaned to Grandpa Piss and whispered, “Grandpa Piss, who’s that?”</p>\n<p>With a patient smile replied, Grandpa Piss said, “He’s Snotty. Don’t you remember Snotty?”</p>\n<p>Mila was surprised. “Oooohh! Snotty! You’ve turned into a real man now I can’t even recognize you anymore!”</p>\n<p>“Haha… you’re surely jest young lady,” Snotty said.</p>\n<p>“No, really…” with fingers on her chin, eyes on muscles, Mila added, “you really transformed into something new, Snotty. I’m impressed. You were so skinny and really a snotty boy back then.”</p>\n<p>The man continued to laugh. The atmosphere was friendly and harmless. Yet Monkey, who had long heard Snotty’s real identity and preceding reputation from Snake’s mouth, began sweating profusely.</p>\n<p>Mila really loved gifted cosmetics and the like. After knowing how effective it was for her beauty, she shamelessly asked, “Can I ask for more, Grandpa Piss? I have a good friend who needs to be a beauty--as soon as possible!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, of course I have more--here, take this,” Grandpa Piss took out another one.</p>\n<p>“Waow!” Mila’s eyes sparkled in a weird glint. Shira, who saw that, knew his cousin’s greed began to surface; suddenly the unruly young lady acted as if she was a timid maiden. “Grandpa Piss… I think my other friend needs it too…” she asked sweetly.</p>\n<p>“Hohoh!” Grandpa Piss stroked his beard again. “Unfortunately, my princess, I’ve got only three pack and I planned to give the last one for Young Lady Malikh.”</p>\n<p>Hearing a certain short-haired girl being mentioned, the shy maiden’s face twisted in an ugly sour face, returned back to her original color. “Tch.”</p>\n<p>“Hey, don’t click your tongue in front of elders,” Shira warned her.</p>\n<p>“Tch.” Mila crossed her arms and threw away her pouting face.</p>\n<p>Shira was always frustrated whenever a younger one like him would be the one to reprimand ethics into this blockhead of a girl.</p>\n<p>“Now, now, young lady. Please remember Grandpa’s already too old to concoct too many cosmetics--getting two packs already good enough,” Snotty said.</p>\n<p>Snake looked at the leaves wrapped cosmetics in Mila’s hands and exclaimed, “Grandfather concocted them himself?”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss nodded with an amiable smile. “Of course. Been twelve years since the last time I was here. It’d be embarrassing if I came with half-hearted gifts, don’t you think so?”</p>\n<hr>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>The nickname of “Grandpa Piss” stuck on Grandmaster Alchemist’s name for twelve years. When a friend of his asked the origin of this horrible nickname, the Grandmaster laughed it off and said a princess of his old friend’s family started calling him that, because her cousin who was still a three years old brat urinated on him every time the Grandmaster tried to hug him.</p>\n<p>Legend said that the princess was also calling the heir of Grandmaster Alchemist’s family with the nickname of “Snotty”. But even to this day, nobody knows which kingdom this cheeky princess comes from.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n","volume-4/chapter-3":"<p>What the Nalaq told Shira lingered in his mind. Good-Natured Spirit blurted something about killing someone as if it was something trivial that could popped out easily in normal conversation. To kill someone after finding out his secret--what kind of secret he needed to protect anyway? A secret he never wanted people to know the fact he was drawing semi-porns for money. But he wasn’t that insecure to kill someone over a petty secret like that? That would be him being not right in the head. The more he thought about Good-Natured Spirit’s remark, the more it disturbed him. Especially right now, when his hands painted in red, bathed in blood. When he just did an act of actual killing.</p>\n<p>“Something on your mind, Young Master Shira?” a rough voice disturbed his train of thought.</p>\n<p>“Ah,” Shira looked at a burly man, an experienced hunter, who called him.</p>\n<p>The man’s body even drenched in thicker blood than him. One would get easily nauseated by the sight of it. Yet it didn’t make the boy flinched, as he was expecting the experience for a few months already.</p>\n<p>“Here. Look at his gut. Spilling out his innards with your own hands might be a good experience for you, young master.”</p>\n<p>The hunter spun a sharp dagger, holding it by the tip of its blade, having a gesture of offering it to his young master.</p>\n<p>“Is that okay? I even had trouble when skinning the hide,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>He’d rather not, to be honest, since splitting a goat’s gut could be messy if he did it crudely. Even if he was the young master of the family, when messing with the raw meat, not even his uncle could save him from the aunties’ nagging. Shira Yashura was nearly sixteen, almost reaching adulthood, so he had to participate in butchering goats; it was a quite tasking task, but was easy enough compared to butchering cows he had to do in a few years. But for the fifteen years old young master, getting the hang of the butchering knife’s handle was plenty of experience already for him.</p>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>As the custom dictates, every month in ngajen ceremony preparation, the boys will have to deal with cows and goats while the girls help aunties plucking chickens’ and ducks’ feathers. Whether the gatekeepers' children or the family’s next heirs, all of them are required to do it every time a major ceremony approaches.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>After doing his part in butchering a goat Shira immediately took a bath to remove the bloody pungent. On a whim he then strolled to the kitchen to grab some snacks. There he witnessed how all the coconuts he and his uncle shred already transformed into delicious foods; rendang, Bulayak satay, coconut satay, spicy curry, many other mouth drolling coconut cuisines. The coconut loving uncle was all smiles and gave him a big portion of the famous beef cuisine the locals called rendang--which, normally, even for a young master like Shira would get to eat rendang once every few months. But with enough wit and experience in currying favor with his uncle, he got to taste those delicious food handed down by his uncle, the Chief Chef, personally.</p>\n<p>“Shira my boy,” Patriarch Shuro said to his nephew who was squatting below the shadow of a thick pillar, happily munching on his rendang, “you’re going to visit Malikh Family tonight. Keep a good check on your cousin. Don’t embarrass Yashura Family and present our rendang_ _for their main family.”</p>\n<p>“Sure.”</p>\n<hr>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>Domesticated cows were less in numbers than goats in Badril Village, so meals from cows, not including the innards which could be made into popular but cheap cuisines, like only served for village big shots or important visitors during the ngajen ceremony.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>Laughters and chatters made the night more merry than any other thay of the month. It was brighter than usual, as villagers came out of their house to set up big braziers to light the road between the families that were holding festives. From one hundred meters away, through the thick wall of the big families, the mouth-watering aroma of prepared food wafted through the air as if they informally invited people to come and to taste the delicacy these big families had. The change in scenery upon the arrival of the night signaled the nigh of Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>Yashura Family, the oldest family around, was known to have the best food amongst all families in Badril Village, while Elzhier Family known as the family that always threw the biggest party post-ceremony--Elzhier Family’s maidservants were beautiful and they’d show off their voluptuous bodies every single ngajen ceremony. Particularly this month however, everyone was anticipating the ceremony thrown by Malikh Family; for two years since the young lady’s absence they threw nothing more than mediocre festivities, her return was to be seen as their revival on the village’s political stage. And from how big their arrangement looked like, it seemed Malikh Family didn’t plan to fail everyone’s expectations.</p>\n<p>Shira Yashura wore the same suit he got from his uncle on his fifteenth birthday. It was the usual suit he’d wear whenever a ceremony was held. His uncle bought it from a merchant who had connections outside the kingdom, which was pretty good since the fabric wasn’t stiff, but could get unbearably itchy in places he didn’t want to scratch whenever there were people around. The obvious part missing from the wears his peers were wearing was beast pelts.</p>\n<p>Pelts from ferocious beasts were known for irrefutable proof for boys’ courage and manliness. As many young gentlemen of Badril Village wore on their necks, always looking for the opportunity to show off the trophy of their preys to girls--which translated as fashionable fads for boys who wanted to get laids.</p>\n<p>Of course, Shira, as part of the dull and no-nonsense camp of the boys in Badril Village, never had participated in that kind of indecent business. He was so dull that the only girl who would accompany him to attend ceremonies was his cousin Mila--who, even though her face was quite pretty, also happened to be in terrible luck for romance.</p>\n<p>“No matter how many times I see it, it’s always impressive to see how fast you wrap all these banana leaves,” Shira commented as he watched how Mila wrapped rendang with banana leaves. She was very good at it, comparable to the aunties’ skills that had been forged day and night in the family’s kitchen.</p>\n<p>“You talking? You’ve done your training with the family's sword technique, I assume?” Mila said with her lips pouted. Shira thought it was unusual for Mila didn’t nag her mouth off immediately when she saw him. He saw a sword wrapped in cloth near Mila. His face immediately twisted in a troubled look.</p>\n<p>“I won’t bring that thing,” he protested.</p>\n<p>“You--” Mila hissed.</p>\n<p>“What should I do with a sword inside another family’s ceremony?” Shira said. The sword was his father’s, and that was his reason he didn’t want to use it. “Look, I can only draw the blade from the sheath at most. Without a proper amount of Strength attribute I can’t swing this properly. It rejects my mana. I’d make a fool out of myself if that happened.”</p>\n<p>“That’s because you were stupidly increasing your Wisdom instead of, that’s why you--arghh! Just forget about it! I know you’re trying to make excuses! Since you’re so weak all we can do is flaunting around your father’s reputation. We’ve got to remind people that our Yashura Family’s not to mess with. Here, just slip this fucking sword in your belt.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, this is embarrassing. Those rumors are about to get worse tonight,” Shira said with a sigh. His reputation as a trash talent was annoying enough, added this shameless act of throwing his weight around, he’d become more reluctant to show his face in the public later on. But still he unwillingly slipped the sword in his belt.</p>\n<p>Mila snorted. She ignored the complaint. Right now she could care less about the rumors about her cousin. What she had to prioritize tonight was the bad premonition she had about Bhela Malikh’s short hair--nobody believed her when she said that Bhela was being a slut for cutting her hair short in spite of her being in an engagement. While her hands craftly knotted the rendang wrapped in banana leaves with a rope made with dried coconut leaves, she suddenly had a cold smile; the image of those impudent Malikhs shuddering under the famous sword of Yashura Family’s Unique Class, Jhuro Yashura the Blackfang Swordsman, entertained her she began to chuckle coldly.</p>\n<p>“Huhuhu… just you wait you bitch…”</p>\n<p>Shira stepped back. He had the hunch he should keep a distance away from his current cousin right now.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Every month, for every family in Badril Village, cooking during the Ngajen Ceremony was always a time rushing hectic. Even more in Malikh Family this time. Since the amount of food they had to deliver before the ceremony started more than twice the amount they made last month, most of the aunties in duty were cooking outdoors. The smoke from the half-dried firewood would be too unbearable for the eyes if all of them cooked in one cramped place. Fortunately, most of the dishes were already cooked and sent to the courtyard, so the only people who were still on duty preparing food were a small number of aunties and maidservants.</p>\n<p>The young maidservants were pale from tiredness but they couldn’t afford to slack in this one Ngajen Ceremony. The usual noisy aunties, they didn’t even show a sign of wanting to rest. Nobody could beat the resilience of the kitchen-duty armies when it came to preparing for a loadful of party’s foods.</p>\n<p>Usually, the one who would supervise these spartan cooking aunties would be the patriarch’s wife, Bhela’s mother. It was already a long-held tradition in the village for the patriarch to cook for the family’s important guests as the Chief Chef, while the wife supported him by supervising the aunties and maidservants. In Ngajen Ceremony this month, however, Bhela’s mother holed herself to accompany the husband on his ill-bed.</p>\n<p>She was not in the mood to meet with people. So Bhela stepped in to fill her position.</p>\n<p>Back when she was little Bhela often followed her mother working during the ngajen ceremony, she knew what she had to do by the back of her hand. In usage of salt, for example, she knew down to the tiniest detail of how much salt should be applied to different kinds of cuisines. She also instructed the inexperienced maidservants who were in charge of cooking side dishes so the overall quality of the feast would be balanced. Bhela Malikh didn’t betray everyone’s expectations about her. She did her work splendidly.</p>\n<p>However, there was a matter she saw that didn’t make her happy. The largest furnace that was usually reserved for the Chief Chef, today was used by an old man from the outer family. A great cook, the old man was. Known for his vast experience in handling the family’s food stalls for years. The problem was his common status. Without at least an elder status made it awkward for him to cook as the Chief Chef in this kitchen, even if he was a mere proxy. Bhela wondered whether the one who took the charge when her parents were unavailable knew the risk of being laughed at and criticized by the other two big families--especially now that the relationship between Yashura and Malikh wasn’t that good like before.</p>\n<p>“Young lady, the day’s getting dark, you should take a bath now and prepare yourself for the ceremony,” an aunty said to Bhela.</p>\n<p>“Yes, young lady is no longer a little girl, so making you pretty will take a while,” an early twenty maidservant added from the side. She continued, “The new girls should be able to complete the foods since you directed them a lot. Please don’t worry about us.”</p>\n<p>“I’m relieved to hear that,” Bhela said. Not yet three seconds later her eyes wandered to the old cook again. She couldn’t hide her frown.</p>\n<p>“Something the matter, Young Lady Bhela?”</p>\n<p>“Yes. Maybe it’s a misunderstanding on my part but… I can’t see the elder who would substitute my father as the Chief Chef.”</p>\n<p>Hearing Bhela said her concern, the aunties and the maidservants averted eyes with their young lady with troubled faces. Bhela then understood there was something shady going on.</p>\n<p>Her suspicion turned worse when she saw a young man in his twenties leading four manservants with him. When the aunties were working in the kitchen, it was an unspoken rule for unrelated adult men not to approach, but the battle-hardened aunties that normally were ferocious in defending their territories were all silent in welcoming the cocky visitors. It wasn’t surprising to Bhela that all of them came from Elder Jhamil’s faction.</p>\n<p>“Why aren’t you ready yet, old worm?!”</p>\n<p>“I am sorry, young elder… some dish cannot be rushed so I prepared some to--”</p>\n<p><em>Slap!!</em></p>\n<p>The slapping sound echoed in the kitchen. The room descended into a dead silent. The old cook was trembling; he lowered his head and covered the cheek that just got slapped but everyone could see the blood on the corner of his mouth. Bhela recollected her memory, and finally remembered the arrogant young man was actually Elder Jhamil’s own son.</p>\n<p>“Shit!” Elder Jhamil’s son swore, “those councils from Village Hall came. We must complete the set before too long! Those people are the ones who usually have the heaviest voice when valuing Ngajen Ceremony dishes!”</p>\n<p>One follower quipped, “Young elder is right. This old worm can’t cook shit! If this goes on, the only things the Village Hall council will remember about Elder Jhamil’s cooking is that we Malikhs cook as slow as snail!”</p>\n<p>The frown on Bhela’s face became deeper. Young elder? Before she went out for the seminars that lasted two years, this man, son of Elder Jhamil, merely a family member with a post within the family’s business. And something else that disturbed her was how she couldn’t see how the blurted about Elder Jhamil’s cooking, the one who worked in the kitchen all day, didn’t see the said elder even once today.</p>\n<p>Bhela still held her silent. But her eyes were cold and sharp judging people and the situation. The aunties and the maidservants, though they looked sympathetic with the old man, were afraid to go against Elder Jhamil’s son. Maybe because the lack of resistance Elder Jhamil’s son dared to do a taboo known in the kitchen--swapping food that wrapped in banana leaves with ceramic plates, garnished a bit, and called it the Chief Chef’s cuisine.</p>\n<p>“No, young elder!” a brave middle-aged aunty stepped forward, “you can’t do that!”</p>\n<p>“Why not?” one follower sneered in Elder Jhamil’s son’s place. “This one also got beef, isn’t it? We need to quickly serve the Chief Chef cuisine to the people from Village Hall councils.”</p>\n<p>“Exactly because they are from the Village Hall council--just from inferior cuts of the beef they’d know the dishes have been swapped! You’ll tarnish Malikh Family’s honor if people knew you were fooling--”</p>\n<p>“Fooling?!” Elder Jhamil roared.</p>\n<p>The young elder raised his hand, though the aunty who complained quickly hid back behind the maidservants. Elder Jhamil’s son then rampaged into a series of barking, yelling and threatening the aunties to cut their salary just because his mood was spoiled.</p>\n<p>His words scared all the girls and the women inside the kitchen. All except Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>After they were done swapping the foods, the young elder led his men out of the kitchen with great swagger. The young elder stopped at the door, turned around, and gave the old cook one last ultimatum: “There’ll be a noble in the ceremony so we need rendang for the main course. So go make it, old worm. You know what’s gonna happen if you couldn’t deliver, don’t you?”</p>\n<p>The old man trembled. Even the eyes on the aunties couldn’t help but shake at the threat. There was now way they could prepare rendang with only two hours remaining until the Ngajen Ceremony started.</p>\n<p>After that situation calmed down. The aunties and the maidservants went back to work. Some of them still exchanged whispered and gossiped amongst themselves. But when Bhela approached, immediately they stopped and pretended nothing happened.</p>\n<p>“Young lady…” a pudgy aunty came to her, the one who stood up against the young elder from before.</p>\n<p>“Aunty?”</p>\n<p>“We are sorry… we’ve had no meaning to show you that embarrassing scene.”</p>\n<p>Bhela shook her head. “No, I’m one from the main family bloodline; I should've been the one who stood up to him instead of hiding behind everyone.”</p>\n<p>The aunty knew the young lady didn’t say a word before because the girl wanted to know the situation. Some other middle-aged aunties who were close with Madam Malikh also knew more or less Bhela’s detached wait-and-see attitude, so no one really would blame her even if she didn’t say a word before--especially since she had just returned from overseas. The pudgy aunty tugged on Bhela’s sleeve, whispered to her ear, “Young Lady Bhela, we know you’re concerned. But we’ve already gotten used to it. You’re still young. Your future is brighter than everyone else in the family, Young Lady Bhela. It’s better to endure than pointlessly making enemies.”</p>\n<p>“This isn’t pointless,” Bhela said. She then grabbed the nearest apron and wore it. Her father was the patriarch. And she wasn’t a poster girl to draw everyone’s attention to the family.</p>\n<p>The pudgy aunty wanted to say something again. But words stuck on her throat, she closed her mouth as soon as she opened it.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the old man began to pick some mature coconut and shredded it listlessly. He got more than four decades of handling food stalls for Malikh Family, he wasn’t a stranger at cooking rendang. But he already gave up on finishing one for tonight’s Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>“Uncle, I’ll take it from here,” Bhela said as she approached the weary old man.</p>\n<p>“Ahh, yes?” the old man was started. The girl came with an apron and common garment, had fair and beautiful skin, as well clear and articulate voice; a maidservant from the inner family was the first one that came to his mind. But only when he noticed even the aunties were respectful to her and her striking bob-cut short hair that the old man began drenched in cold sweat.</p>\n<p>“I said, uncle,” Bhela repeated, “I’ll take it from here. You can rest now.”</p>\n<p>The old man vigorously shook his head.</p>\n<p>“Please Young Lady Bhela… please spare this old bone….”</p>\n<p>“This is originally my father’s post, uncle. You’ll have to be at least an elder and write your name in council’s ledger to be a substitute for my father.”</p>\n<p>The old man wanted to break into a tearless cry. This is worse than when he faced Elder Jhamil’s son's harassment before. The most thing he was afraid of was the news of Elder Jhamil using him as Chief Chef behind the scene to reach the ears of the main family. And now that Bhela Malikh was here, there was nothing he could do but to resign his life to fate.</p>\n<p>“Y-young lady!” a maidservant yelled, “you can’t!”</p>\n<p>“Who says I can’t?” Bhela asked sharply.</p>\n<p>An aunty, who had a stern-looking face, said, “You can’t cook for the main course, young lady. In case of a patriarch's absence, usually one of the elders who’s going to take his place. There’s no rule saying it’s okay for women to do it.”</p>\n<p>“Then, I’m going to ask,” from the aunty, Bhela threw her glance toward the old man, “are you an elder cooking here to substitute my father as a cook, uncle?”</p>\n<p>The old man’s face turned pale. Whichever the answer of that question would lead him to the road of punishment. All of the sudden, he became a mute.</p>\n<p>Because she had the most standing, nobody made a sound when Young Lady Bhela Malikh asked them to fetch chickens and spices for her.</p>\n<p>Not long after, the story about how the Young Lady of Malikh Family wanted to substitute her father spread like a wildfire. Never in Badril Village’s history would a young lady do that. A crowd of curious males, mostly the youngsters from main and outer of Malikh Family, surrounded the kitchen as they wanted to catch a glimpse of how their beautiful young lady recklessly challenged the custom by her own. The boys sighed in admiration. Bhela Malikh was essentially an Archer at heart. But the way she handled a blade, even if it was a kitchen knife, was skillful and graceful, as every time her slim wrist stopped moving from cutting down a vegetable, a wave of gulping could be heard. The boys couldn’t take their eyes from her. The reckless and brave young lady was simply too charming.</p>\n<p>“Did you know that foreigners often confuse rendang as dried curry?” Bhela said to one maidservant who stared at the way she cooked. “Curry leaves originated from an area close to western Haldeen lands, so many local Mossacks sailed the sea to try their luck making it big working for western empires.”</p>\n<p>The usual aloof Bhela unusually was talkative when she was cooking, which was quite a big surprise for people who were watching. She explained to the clueless maidservants how, during her two years travelling in seminars from countries to countries, found many noble owned restaurants claimed to serve rendang but turned out to be dried curry. All the while sharply focused on doing her cooking duty.</p>\n<p>“Young lady!” from the crowd came out an angry bald man. He was Elder Jhamil. “W-what are you doing there?”</p>\n<p>“I’m cooking,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“But you can’t work there!” Elder Jhamil yelled. “No woman can substitute for patriarch! That’s against the rule!”</p>\n<p>“I don’t recall we have a rule like that.”</p>\n<p>“If you know why you still stand there?”</p>\n<p>“Neither do I recall a rule for an elder to use a stand-in for the Chief Chef position.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s face turned weird as if he suddenly got constipated. Many of the youngsters didn’t catch Bhela’s remarks nor they cared too much about it, but some in the crowd were nodding knowingly, as many of them were familiar with how shady Elder Jhamil was doing things.</p>\n<p>As the bald elder’s head was racing fast looking for an answer to defuse the young lady’s claim, suddenly, a loud roar exploded behind him.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela, who do you think you are? Just because your father is the family’s patriarch you think you can do whatever you want?!”</p>\n<p>The faces of aunties and the maidservants twitched. They witnessed how the young elder harassed the old man before, so they were itching to throw back the same question at him instead, though no more brave aunties dared to cause more troubles.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s son continued, “The ingredient for making Chief dishes takes money, young lady. Not even the patriarch himself has the daring to use coins from the treasury for himself. Do you want to embarrass your parents that much?”</p>\n<p>“I’m not making this food for myself nor I cook for my father. It’s for the guests. And I provided the spices and the foreign curry leaves by myself,” Bhela said. Some maidservants behind her nodded nervously as Bhela indeed ordered them to fetch spices from the personal kitchen in the main family’s residential area.</p>\n<p>In spite of that, the young elder kept pushing on with nasty smile on his face.</p>\n<p>“What about the chicken, young lady? They cost money! What do you say about that, huh?”</p>\n<p>Behind Bhela, the aunties, even the maidservants, were whispering at each other on how ridiculous it was to question the sole young generation of Malikh Family main bloodline over some chickens. Even Bhela, the young lady in question, would only glanced at the troubled expression of Elder Jhamil.</p>\n<p>“I will pay for the chicken,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Ha? Pay? With what? Your father’s money? Can’t a sick person even pay the cost of the foods for ngajen ceremony all by himself?”</p>\n<p>“No need to bring my father’s name here.” Bhela said with a dangerously cold tone.</p>\n<p>The chillness in her eyes was telling that she really did hate people bringing her parents’ name in bad faith. After hearing gasps of surprise from people that didn’t expect the usually silent young lady could utter something with such a biting tone, she sighed, said with an explanation, “I got a dress as a gift from a certain person who has too much money in his pocket. He said the dress is so valuable even the princesses wear them in parties. It should cover the cost of these chickens I’m going to cook if I sell the dress right here right now.”</p>\n<p>Bhela then tilted her head and glanced at the bald elder.</p>\n<p>“Am I right, Elder Jhamil?”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil wanted to maintain his smile, but his face went stiff as stone. He was trembling inside for knowing that the dress he acquired with a large sum of money and with his best connection, valued the same as some mere village chickens in Bhela’s eyes.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, his son, who was taken aback for a bit from the cold remark Bhela had said earlier, recovered, began to yell again, “Ha! Did you not train your brain when you were overseas, my young lady? The same dress princesses wear in parties? Only someone dumb believe that! Hah! Obviously you’ve been lied to! You’ve been crooked, young lady, crooked--”</p>\n<p><em>Paak!</em></p>\n<p>From behind, the already red-faced Elder Jhamil smacked his son’s head. “You’ve been rude to Young Lady Bhela, you dumbskull! You have to apologize! Young lady can’t bear to hear it anymore!”</p>\n<p>While in fact it was him who couldn’t bear to hear being called a crook.</p>\n<p>“Apologize!” Elder Jhamil roared.</p>\n<p><em>Splash!</em></p>\n<p>The pair father and son’s performance didn’t amuse Bhela, however. With the lid in her hand, Bhela scooped boiling curry broth and splashed it to their direction. Surprised, the stupid young elder swore with nasty words while his father cried in high-pitched voice.</p>\n<p>“Please get out,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil laughed wryly.</p>\n<p>“Please don’t be like that, young lady. I know my son doesn't have the best education but--”</p>\n<p><em>Splash!!</em></p>\n<p>Bhela waved the cooking lid once again as soon as Elder Jhamil stepped forward. The hot water splashed on his expensive boots. This time, while he didn’t expect for Bhela splashing hot water at him again, he wasn’t freaking out. It seemed his plan to make the young lady behave a little backfiring instead. His face turned solemn.</p>\n<p>“Young lady…”</p>\n<p>“I’m not going to say it thrice--everyone who has nothing to do in the kitchen, please get out,” Bhela said. “Or else--”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The major families’ lands were astonishingly spacious and complex, their walls were thick and tall, therefore each of them employed a few stationary guards for the main gate as gatekeepers. These gatekeepers, though usually filled by members of the outer part of the families, their duty were significantly more important than others since they represented the face of the family they served. So they always maintain polite gestures to everyone who came through their gate, either commoners or rich people from big families. Yet when Shira and Mila arrived the Malikh Family’s gatekeepers didn’t even hide their scoffs.</p>\n<p>“Ridiculous!” she hissed with a face boiled in anger, “even lowly gatekeepers are looking down on us!”</p>\n<p>“Don’t bother with them,” Shira said. Unlike his cousin’s furious temper, his flair seemed like he shrugged the blatant disrespect, as the holder of “Eternal Novice” title he was already numb by how people were talking behind his back.</p>\n<p>“If your father was here they’d bow their asses as soon as they saw us Yashura coming.”</p>\n<p>Shira shrugged his shoulders again.</p>\n<p>Still seething in anger, Mila cast her eyes on the banana leaves wrapped food in Shira’s hands. “Who should we give the rendang to?” she asked.</p>\n<p>“Let’s just give it to a random servant.” Then Shira called a maidservant who was carrying a tray full of food. “Excuse me!”</p>\n<p>“Yes? What can I help y--” The moment this maidservant turned her head and saw Shira’s face, she immediately threw back her eyes and escaped with hurried trot, pretending she saw nothing.</p>\n<p>“The fuck?!” Mila was flastergabbed, didn’t know what to say.</p>\n<p>Later on Shira and Mila realized how unpopular Yashura Family was to the current Malikhs, even the servants who usually held no voice in the family were avoiding the pair of cousins like plague. Their attitude especially worsened when it came to Shira Yashura.</p>\n<p>“Look there,” someone whispered amongst the guests, “Yashura Family send their eldest young miss and the young master! Out of all the Ngajen Ceremony, they choose tonight to show their faces--pretty obvious, eh? Bet they’re drooling to get another Unique Class after knowing our Young Lady Bhela’s real talent tonight!”</p>\n<p>Someone else agreed and replied, “With that kind of trash as their young master, they’d be dreamin’ to get even a touch of our Young Lady Bhela. Pueh!”</p>\n<p>Hearing the muffled disdain, Mila Yashura whirled her body, glaring people with eagle eyes. “Who said that?!” she growled.</p>\n<p>“Mila…” Shira held her shoulder.</p>\n<p>“The fuckers don’t even put our Yashura Family in their eyes. Just because shitty rumors about Unique Class they started to feel high and mighty, eh?”</p>\n<p>“Just let go, Uncle Shuro didn’t send us here to start troubles,” Shira said. “All we need to do is to show our faces here and give them our rendang. It’s not our problem whether they welcome our good intention with grace or not.”</p>\n<p>Though Shira said that, he secretly hoped Malikh Family would grow too proud to receive it--all so he had an excuse to keep his uncle’s rendang for himself.</p>\n<p>A commotion arose. People hussing here and there with excitement. When Shira and Mila wanted to know what was going on, a parade of beautiful young women glittering and stealing the whole show came from inside of Malikh Family’s hall. Leading them was a short-haired young beauty, face as icy as an ice sculpture, the recent name that everyone had been talking about these days, Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>It was clear from the way Bhela positioned herself she represented the family as the ceremony’s Chief Chef.</p>\n<p>“Whoa, so Malikh Family let her do that,” Shira murmured.</p>\n<p>Not to mention being the Chief Chef--the most Shira did in his family’s kitchen was helping his uncle, helping him shred coconuts. They were at the same age, but the same old Shira still practiced butchering goats while the supposed fiancée of his was climbing the social ladder. Even Mila was angry by the special treatment Malikh Family gave to their young lady.</p>\n<p>“Sup, young master!” from behind a voice called him.</p>\n<p>Shira turned around, found the one who greeted him was Monkey.</p>\n<p>“Who?” Mila asked Shira as the stranger with a monkey-like face approaching.</p>\n<p>“This one is called by the name of Monkey, young lady,” Monkey, with his self-trained Mossack’s style bowing gesture, introduced himself smoothly.</p>\n<p>Mila hummed in ackwnoledgement. It was harder to forget than remembering someone with such combination of face and awkward name.</p>\n<p>“Mister Monkey, I thought you’ll spend the ceremony to show Mister Snake around since he’s an outsider. What are you doing in Malikh Family?” Shira asked.</p>\n<p>“Now, now, please drop the ‘Mister’, young master. I’m not that old yet to be called as such,” Monkey said, then he continued explaining his story this evening. “We were planning to go to your family’s ceremony, young master. But who would have thought Snake to meet with his relatives here? His relatives are actually Malikh Family’s guests for tonight’s Ngajen Ceremony. Bet he got to eat expensive cuisines right now.”</p>\n<p>“Well, it’ll be easier with Mister Snake here. I’ve got some coins I want to show you, I wonder if it works to use them for--” Shira sneakily glanced at his cousin, then turned back to Monkey like it was nothing, “--for the thing we talked about yesterday.”</p>\n<p>Mila sneered, “You have some business to attend, no?”</p>\n<p>“Not really, no,” Shira shrugged off her question.</p>\n<p>“Really, though?” Mila crossed her arms, sneered again. “I think I saw Romana just now. I’mma chat with her a little bit.”</p>\n<p>It seemed to Shira that his cousin meeting with Romana here, in Malikh Family’s Ngajen Ceremony, wasn’t simply to have fun. He didn’t like his cousin would make trouble but he didn’t want to spend the whole night with her either. “Don’t go home without me,” he said eventually.</p>\n<p>“Hmph! You’re not a kid anymore but still need me to accompany you home?”</p>\n<p>No, Shira actually was more worried about her than himself.</p>\n<p>He then glanced beside and said, “Mister Monkey.”</p>\n<p>“Just Monkey,” Monkey corrected.</p>\n<p>“Mister Just Monkey, you said Mister Snake with relative? And his relatives are Malikh Family’s guests?”</p>\n<p>“Not Just Mon--ah, forget about it,” Monkey already gave up guessing whether Young Master Shira Yashura was purposely pulling his leg or not. “They really were Malikh Family’s guests, they even got the front row for the prayer and all.”</p>\n<p>“Is hard for us to be friendly if Mister Snake is involved with Malikh Family.”</p>\n<p>“You mean, that, huh? Well, I’ve been here for a while and they talked about you a lot, so I guess even someone as chill as you can get angry sometimes. But you don’t have to worry about those Malikhs, Young Master Shira. As long as their patriarch is Ghalim Malikh they won’t sever ties with Yashura so easily.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, is this your opinion?”</p>\n<p>“It’s Snake’s. It’s what he said before he met his relatives.”</p>\n<p>Shira thought the Alchemist he met once before was a total stranger of Badril Village, but it appeared he was wrong. “He really does know about Malikh Family that much, doesn’t he?”</p>\n<p>“Well, yeah, but I think he’s more familiar with Yashura than Malikh Family, though,” Monkey said, crossing his arms and nodded to himself as he recalled things that Snake told him to get his wares supported by Yashura Family; for example, obtaining Butler Yulong’s permission the same as Patriarch Shuro Yashura’s, Snake once said.</p>\n<p>“What? Why do you make that kind of face, Young Master Shira?” Monkey was snapped from his train of thought.</p>\n<p>“Ah, no, I just don’t expect you’re going to say some like that.”</p>\n<p>“What are you saying, young master. In the first place, Snake became my crew because he heard I’ve some dealing with Yashura Family.”</p>\n<p>Shira did recall the first time Monkey contacted Yashura Family--through him. To be more exact, the first item Monkey dealt from Malikh Family was Shira’s smuggled erotic painting that Good-Natured Spirit rejected.</p>\n<p>“--Speaking of Snake,” with his thumb Monkey did point in a certain direction. The place was separated from the common guest as they indeed were Malikh Family’s special guests. Shira’s eyes followed and he saw the familiar Alchemist he knew not long ago, Snake, was talking with two men, young and old, most likely brother and his grandfather.</p>\n<p>“Don’t be fooled by their appearances, young master. They’re renowned experts,” Monkey said.</p>\n<p>The pair of brother and grandfather wore worn out pale robes as their clothes, unlike the image of revered experts in Shira’s mind. Monkey told him both likely to travel incognito for various reasons. The old man had an old white hair and long beard, his back crooked and had to bring a walking staff to support himself, and gave people the impression of a sleepy grandpa from the dim light on his eyes. The young one though, had an always angry-looking face with fierce brows, crossing his muscle-thick arms, locked in a debate with Snake. Snake’s face was notably paler than when Shira met him in the market.</p>\n<p>“We can’t greet Mister Snake now, can we?” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think we can,” Monkey said. Even though he long considered Snake as his partner, the two guests appearing incognito were still the main members of the revered Alchemist family. This was no time for commoners like him acting friendly on them all of the sudden.</p>\n<p>The sleepy-looking old man, noticing two pairs of eyes looking at him, he raised his head. He caught the sight of Shira. Their eyes met.</p>\n<p>“Oh ho,” the old man smiled when he found the boy. He dragged his old body to approach the flastergabbed Shira and Monkey.</p>\n<p>Even Monkey who knew more about them wouldn’t expect Snake’s relatives to introduce themselves first.</p>\n<p>“He’s heading this way…”</p>\n<p>“Ah, yes, apparently.”</p>\n<p>Monkey gulped. “It’s different with Snake. Although he looked like that, whatever you do, please, young master, you can’t afford to be rude in front of this elder…”</p>\n<p>From the nervousness in Monkey’s voice Shira found the approaching old man seemed to hail from a more prestigious family than he originally thought.</p>\n<p>“Greeting, elder,” Shira said with his head humbly lowered as soon as he approached.</p>\n<p>The old man chuckled, patted Shira’s head, said, “Ah, Young Master, look how much you’ve grown. It feels like only yesterday how happy you were running around like a little kid you are.”</p>\n<p>Shira nodded hearing that. He glanced beside him, and caught Monkey’s face flabbergasted looking both at the boy and the old man.</p>\n<p>Hiding his embarrassment behind a fake cough, Shira then tried to understand whether the old man mistook him for someone else. “I’m sorry, elder. I don’t know if I’m mistaken, but, have we met before?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, have we met? Of course we’ve--” he stopped. The old man's eyes were covered by a pair of soft hands of a girl.</p>\n<p>“Guess who this is?” the girl who sneakily teased the old man from behind was grinning.</p>\n<p>“Oho! Who is this? Who is this?” the old man smiled delightedly.</p>\n<p>Both Shira and Monkey were tense watching the scene before them. Especially Shira Yashura, who knew that the grin on his cousin’s face always told that the girl enjoyed herself a little bit too much.</p>\n<p>“Isn’t this… Tomboy Princess?” the old man guessed.</p>\n<p>“Tuut! Wrong!”</p>\n<p>Mila released her hands. When the old man turned to see the preparator, he exclaimed with a chuckle.</p>\n<p>“It’s really you, Tomboy Princess.”</p>\n<p>Mila excitedly echoed, “It’s really you, Grandpa Piss!”</p>\n<p>They were so glad they met after a long time that they started to hug each other. Then Mila pull herself from the oldman’s embrace, yelling, “Ugghh…” she pinched her nose, “I smell something pissy around here.”</p>\n<p>Just when Shira and Monkey wondered what Mila meant by that, the girl looked at the old man, saying, “It’s no wonder it smells pissy. Have you taken a bath, Grandpa Piss.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss answered with a laugh. But Shira and Monkey facepalmed.</p>\n<p>So much for being mindful in front of the revered old expert.</p>\n<p>Shira awkwardly smiled to cover his shame. “Mila, you should be mindful in front of elders.”</p>\n<p>“Mindful?” Mila gasped. “In front of Grandpa Piss? Why?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, it’s okay, young master,” the old man said as he waved his hand. “I’m not that old to lose my sense of humor. Yashura Family’s princess sure is as naughty as always.” His wrinkles deepened as he curled his lips into a big smile. He said to Mila, “I reckon Patriarch Shuro’s been well, my princess? I recall he got a lot of migraines back in the day.”</p>\n<p>Haughtily, Mila replied, “Don’t worry about that guy, Grandpa Piss. His brain capacity has been declining these past years so there’s really nothing left inside to give him any headache!”</p>\n<p>“Ehem,” Shira cleared his phlegm. “She meant our patriarch has been well, elder.”</p>\n<p>“That’s what I said,” Mila laughed, and the old man laughed too. After that Mila kissed Grandpa Piss’s right hand as if she was kissing an elder’s hand from her own family, then continued laughing as cheeky as always.</p>\n<p>“My naughty princess,” Grandpa Piss ruffled Mila’s hair, “I planned to visit Yashura Family later. But since we’ve already met, here, please take this.”</p>\n<p>Receiving a pack wrapped in dried leaves, Mila pouted her lips. “You wouldn’t be lying about this being a candy again, would you?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, of course not.”</p>\n<p>As far as her memory served her well, what Grandpa Piss called candy actually a really bitter herb for young children to gain their appetite. Mila sniffed. She opened it and have a little taste. “Uuueeekk!”</p>\n<p>It was sour and even more bitter than she remembered. “What the hell is this?!”</p>\n<p>“That herb’s not for consumption, Young Lady Mila” the big man with muscles, Snake’s big brother, said from behind Grandpa Piss. He was smiling politely despite the other party merely a young lady of a rural village. “It’s a cosmetic for skin care.”</p>\n<p>“Skin care?!”</p>\n<p>Mila’s mouth widened agape. But soon as she glanced at the muscle man who was approaching her, she became wary, leaned to Grandpa Piss and whispered, “Grandpa Piss, who’s that?”</p>\n<p>With a patient smile replied, Grandpa Piss said, “He’s Snotty. Don’t you remember Snotty?”</p>\n<p>Mila was surprised. “Oooohh! Snotty! You’ve turned into a real man now I can’t even recognize you anymore!”</p>\n<p>“Haha… you’re surely jest young lady,” Snotty said.</p>\n<p>“No, really…” with fingers on her chin, eyes on muscles, Mila added, “you really transformed into something new, Snotty. I’m impressed. You were so skinny and really a snotty boy back then.”</p>\n<p>The man continued to laugh. The atmosphere was friendly and harmless. Yet Monkey, who had long heard Snotty’s real identity and preceding reputation from Snake’s mouth, began sweating profusely.</p>\n<p>Mila really loved gifted cosmetics and the like. After knowing how effective it was for her beauty, she shamelessly asked, “Can I ask for more, Grandpa Piss? I have a good friend who needs to be a beauty--as soon as possible!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, of course I have more--here, take this,” Grandpa Piss took out another one.</p>\n<p>“Waow!” Mila’s eyes sparkled in a weird glint. Shira, who saw that, knew his cousin’s greed began to surface; suddenly the unruly young lady acted as if she was a timid maiden. “Grandpa Piss… I think my other friend needs it too…” she asked sweetly.</p>\n<p>“Hohoh!” Grandpa Piss stroked his beard again. “Unfortunately, my princess, I’ve got only three pack and I planned to give the last one for Young Lady Malikh.”</p>\n<p>Hearing a certain short-haired girl being mentioned, the shy maiden’s face twisted in an ugly sour face, returned back to her original color. “Tch.”</p>\n<p>“Hey, don’t click your tongue in front of elders,” Shira warned her.</p>\n<p>“Tch.” Mila crossed her arms and threw away her pouting face.</p>\n<p>Shira was always frustrated whenever a younger one like him would be the one to reprimand ethics into this blockhead of a girl.</p>\n<p>“Now, now, young lady. Please remember Grandpa’s already too old to concoct too many cosmetics--getting two packs already good enough,” Snotty said.</p>\n<p>Snake looked at the leaves wrapped cosmetics in Mila’s hands and exclaimed, “Grandfather concocted them himself?”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss nodded with an amiable smile. “Of course. Been twelve years since the last time I was here. It’d be embarrassing if I came with half-hearted gifts, don’t you think so?”</p>\n<hr>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>The nickname of “Grandpa Piss” stuck on Grandmaster Alchemist’s name for twelve years. When a friend of his asked the origin of this horrible nickname, the Grandmaster laughed it off and said a princess of his old friend’s family started calling him that, because her cousin who was still a three years old brat urinated on him every time the Grandmaster tried to hug him.</p>\n<p>Legend said that the princess was also calling the heir of Grandmaster Alchemist’s family with the nickname of “Snotty”. But even to this day, nobody knows which kingdom this cheeky princess comes from.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n","volume-4/chapter-4-5":"<p>Badril Village, though had been two years passed without her presence, was the same as always for Bhela Malikh. She hadn’t that many acquaintances her age she could consider friendly before. In spite of that, from the day she returned, people act as if they were her rekindled childhood friends she never knew she had.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” a daughter of an elder from Elzhier Family asked curiously, “is the rumor about that story true?”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at her with eyelids half-closed.</p>\n<p>“Which rumor?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, silly you, of course <em>that</em> rumor! The one about your romance with a blue blood noble!”</p>\n<p>Giggles of girls followed after the girl’s words. When Bhela returned to Badril Village she brought not only fame and reputation, but interesting stories and rumors as well. She was currently surrounded by curious young ladies who sought for exciting gossip.</p>\n<p>“Yeah, yeah!” another girl excitedly hussing in low voice. “I heard he’ll attend Malikh’s ngajen ceremony tonight!”</p>\n<p>“Really?”</p>\n<p>“Why else would Young Lady Bhela take the Chef Chief position if she didn’t expect for her lover to come tonight? He’ll come for sure!”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, yeah, everybody is saying Young Lady Bhela doing just for that!”</p>\n<p>Bhela found it was amazing how people could conjure their own rumors despite not seeing the true story by their own eyes.</p>\n<p>And just when the young ladies started getting excited discussing Young Lady Bhela’s ‘love life’, a vigorous shout resounded the courtyard announcing that Blackwood Family had arrived.</p>\n<p>“Blackwood Family?” someone cocked their head and looked over the direction of the gate. “What kind of family is so bold announcing their names in other family’s ngajen ceremony? Not even Village Head’s Elzhier Family would do to the ceremony host!”</p>\n<p>“Only foreigners to be that stupid to be rude in big family like Malikh! If this is my place I’d send a guard to kick their ass out as soon as possible!”</p>\n<p>“Look over there! Malikh Family elders are rushing to the gate! Let’s check out how’s Malikhs going to deal with it!”</p>\n<p>Curious guests were tailing the elders to see some commotion they thought would occur. However, not only did the Malikhs not make a fuss over it, they even bowed their heads toward the newly arrived noble as if they were servants greeting their returning master. Young people were overly excited because nobles were foreign and appeared in stories all of their lives.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Mila, who already went back with her friend, was gritting teeth with anger. Beside her Romana was holding the tomboy back, though concerned she didn't say a word.</p>\n<p>“Why should I am the one who always had to hold myself back?” Mila hissed in a low voice as if she was wronged.</p>\n<p>“Look around and think about who’s receiving the blow the most. Everyone’s talking about your cousin right now--do you want to make it worse for him?”</p>\n<p>After hearing her friend’s warning, Mila began to take a deep breath and think things through. Romana was right. When she opened her ears Mila could hear people comparing the young master of this noble Blackwood Family with her cousin Shira. They compared such a gallant-looking young noble with a trash of Yashura Family young master, adding with their own biased seasoning here and there, making her cousin Shira look really bad. Mila trembled as her face boiled red from holding back her anger.</p>\n<p>“Where’s Shira right now?”</p>\n<p>“I think he went hiding!” Romana said.</p>\n<p>“Hiding?! He’s embarrassed to show his face that much?”</p>\n<p>After circling around a bit, Mila found the boy’s silhouette in the shadow far from the braziers' light. There, he was squatting, hiding along with two other silhouettes who were also squatting in a suspicious manner.</p>\n<p>“Now, young master, where the hell did you get this coin?” someone whispered from the suspicious bunch.</p>\n<p>The reply came also in the same hushed manner. “Don’t ask me now, just know I’ve got a few more hidden in my house. I can’t move my family, but if you’re fine with this, I can invest in your goods earlier.”</p>\n<p>“We’re fine? Of course we’re fine! Don’t you know how amazing this coin is?”</p>\n<p>“It’s amazing? I can’t even buy satays with this. Nobody here would receive unfamiliar currency.”</p>\n<p>“But don’t you know how far ahead you can go if merchants know you grab some of these coins?”</p>\n<p>“You tell me.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, these coins weren’t issued by any countries, but they’re valuable. Lots of herbs and ingredients in the black markets can only be bought with these coins...”</p>\n<p><em>...whisper whisper whisper...</em></p>\n<p>Mila approached.</p>\n<p>“Ey, what are you doing?!”</p>\n<p>For some reasons, Shira and Monkey, one of his companions, almost jumped in fright by her barking. Both Mila and Romana behind her saw Shira and Monkey were acting suspicious--but Sneak, the third silhouette, didn’t even try to hide that he was nibbling on something delicious.</p>\n<p>Mila, with a weird face, hissed, “Is that… <em>rendang</em> you guys were eating?”</p>\n<p>“<em>Cough, cough,</em>” hiding the opened wrapping banana leaves, Shira awkwardly trying to make an excuse, “I think Malikh Family is too eager to cut off relationships with our Yashura Family so… I reckon they don’t need this anymore…”</p>\n<p>Mila was so angry she slapped the banana leaves in Shira’s hand.</p>\n<p>“Ah, my rendang…”</p>\n<p>“Your rendang?! You goddamn moron!” Mila hissed, she didn’t dare to roar and announce themselves to other guests. “You’re about to get cuckolded and all you think about is a goddamn rendang?!”</p>\n<p>“Young master, someone trying to get you cuckolded?” licking his fingers for some leftover rendang sauce, Snake asked from the side.</p>\n<p>Shira shook his head. “Cuckold is a very strong word. That girl didn’t even consider me from the beginning. It’s not like we're a married couple yet.”</p>\n<p>He then came to pick the spoiled beef and mourned, “ah… my poor rendang.”</p>\n<p>“Stop crying over that shit! It’s not important!”</p>\n<p>Monkey blurted, “Rendang is not important?”</p>\n<p>Mila glared at Monkey. The monkey-faced peddler closed his mouth as soon as he opened it.</p>\n<p>Romana saw her friend Mila had a bad affinity with her cousin whenever she was angry, thus came to explain from the side, “Young Master Shira, don’t you know people outside the Mossack culture do take engagement seriously? It’s understandable for a young heir of a conservative family like Yashura to not care much about it--but, whatever your feelings regarding your engagement is, if Young Lady Bhela has an affair outside, she’ll also drag down Yashura Family’s reputation. So please be mindful about it more for the sake of your family.”</p>\n<p>They didn’t really think about this deeply since straightforward Mossack people were the type to have children before they were even married. If things went awry, Shira reckoned his uncle and the elders in his family might think the engagement matter was similar to puppy love, about children bantering, but the young generation who was exposed to stories and gossips from books and travellers might think about it differently. And someone who didn’t hang out so much like Shira wouldn’t be able to tell how these youngsters would talk about this incident in the future.</p>\n<p>So Shira stood up and patted his trouser, admitted, “Ah, you’re right, Romana.”</p>\n<p>Mila crossed her arms. Frowning at her cousin. “What are you gonna do now? Fight them? No need to be afraid, I’m with you.”</p>\n<p>Snake, still squatting comfortably, added, “Young Master, my grandfather and my older brother are still here too. You won’t be at a disadvantage in case things go downhill.”</p>\n<p>“It’s decided. Let’s kick their asses!” Mila growled.</p>\n<p>“The heck are you talking about kicking people’s asses in Ngajen Ceremony?” Shira grunted.</p>\n<p>“Then at least let me slap that slut’s arrogant face!”</p>\n<p>Shira shook his head.</p>\n<p>“Let’s go,” he said.</p>\n<p>“We’re gonna slap her face now?” Mila asked.</p>\n<p>“No. We at least have to make Family Yashura’s presence known here,” Shira said. He caught his companions’ confused expressions, so he added, “Everyone is getting excited because most of them are young'uns. But if this incident gets out of the hands, the elders from other families won’t be silent about it.”</p>\n<p>Mila wanted to say something but didn’t after seeing Shira’s relaxed face. She didn’t want to say something silly that’d change the boy’s mind. Therefore, with Shira leading the way, she and her friend Romana went to see the ruckus caused by the noble’s arrival. Leaving Monkey and Sneak who were silent looking at their back.</p>\n<p>The two exchanged glances.</p>\n<p>They looked down, eyes sweeping the ground.</p>\n<p>“Mm?” Monkey mumbled, his hands crawling all over the dirt.</p>\n<p>Snake took out a magic wand. The wand shimmered with a gentle light, then he used that to give some light to the ground where the rendang was spoiled.</p>\n<p>But it was Monkey who shouted in joy, “I got one!”</p>\n<p>“Give me that!” Snake pounced the moment he saw Monkey rubbed the dirt of a piece of rendang.</p>\n<p>Pushing out Snake’s face from grabbing the rendang in his hand, Monkey felt wronged and cried, “Why would a rich gentleman like you fight over a single beef with this poor peddler? Don’t you know my family can only afford to eat beef once a year?”</p>\n<p>“Why, you asked?” Snake sneered, “There’s no need to say the obvious. You don’t get to eat Patriarch Shuro’s handmade rendang everyday! And I’m saying this after starving for beef ever since I’m following you.”</p>\n<p>“Fuck off!”</p>\n<p>“Give me that!”</p>\n<p>“No!”</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the shadowy corner where they were wrestling came to be lightened up with a lit torch.</p>\n<p>“Ehem, you two gentlemen,” a voice called.</p>\n<p>For a moment, Monkey and Snake stopped fighting.</p>\n<p>The voice owner was a man with Malikh Family’s servant uniform. Reluctantly, he continued, “Badril Village locals are usually open-minded and tolerant people. However, we have a bottom line. If you two couldn’t hold it you should rent some inn room or do it in the bushes! Don’t do it in the open, you’re making people uncomfortable! Know some shame!”</p>\n<p>Monkey at first didn’t get what the servant was talking about. Then he realized during infighting over the rendang, he had opened his legs, and Snake was on top of him in a very, very awkward manner.</p>\n<p>“Dammit!” he kicked Snake and trembling over the horror he caught himself in. But suddenly he noticed the rendang in his hand already vanished. He whirled his head around. Snake was already licking his fingers with a satisfied face.</p>\n<p>“Dammit!” Monkey howled again.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The one who enthusiastically greeted the young noble of Blackwood Family was Elder Jhamil instead of Bhela Malikh. He managed to conjure thirty years worth of bullshitting skills to flatter and fawn over the other party, rather thick faced to continue despite the young master of noble family rolled his eyes several times. As soon as the young noble caught the sight of a short-haired girl he immediately escaped from Elder Jhamil’s clutch with a big grin on his face.</p>\n<p>“Ah, Sister Bhela!”</p>\n<p>“Young Master Frane Blackwood.”</p>\n<p>“How are you doing Young Lady Bhela? Fancy to meet you again,” he said as he gifted the girl a flower.</p>\n<p>Bhela received the flower but then immediately passed it to a random maidservant beside her. She said as if it was nothing, “I’m fine. Thank you.”</p>\n<p>Young Master Frane Blackwood smiled wryly. “I’ve been travelling with hardly any rest so that I can see you sooner, my young lady,” the young master of Blackwood Family, Frane Blackwood, said, “may I be so lucky to receive your company tonight?”</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry, but here the words ‘tonight’s companion’ have different meanings than when you say it in the western-style ball--so, no, Young Master Blackwood, I can’t give you company tonight,” she said.</p>\n<p>The young noble still had a smile and wanted to correct his wording, but Bhela suddenly raised her hand and said, “Excuse me.”</p>\n<p>She went past him and greeted another pair of guests instead.</p>\n<p>“Greeting, sir, madam.”</p>\n<p>“It’s about time,” the middle-aged man didn’t answer Bhela’s greeting, but complained instead. “You know the other families had begun their ceremonies, right? Even though we don’t have the same ceremony as your Ngajen Ceremony from the place where I come from, but I know those who don’t take any old ceremonies seriously only brought bad luck over their lands.”</p>\n<p>There was a rare restraint in Bhela’s voice as she replied, “I apologize for our bad conduct, Sir Instructor. I will request the elders to proceed with the ceremony. Please let me lead you toward the reserved spot I previously prepared for both of you.”</p>\n<p>“Lead the way then.”</p>\n<p>Badril Village locals witnessed the valiant Young Lady of Malikh Family taking charge of the Ngajen Ceremony as the Chief Chef, but with the appearance of her bowing to two unfamiliar guests as well, whispers were floating amongst the Ngajen Ceremony guests. Before long, everyone knew that two guests Bhela Malikh greeted were the ones she personally invited, but was neglected before the family’s gate because of the excitement made by the noble’s arrival. Bhela came to them to apologize in person.</p>\n<p>Young Master Frane Blackwood, who felt ignored, pulled a self-decrepitating sneer. He complained to Elder Jhamil instead, “Oh, Malikh Family elder, can you tell me the identity of those two guests who made even Young Lady Bhela to bow her head?”</p>\n<p>“Ehem, ehem,” Elder Jhamil didn’t know what to answer, so he concocted a reply out of thin air, “I think they were relatives from her maternal family.”</p>\n<p>“Is that so? From the way they are dressed, they don’t look from that respectable background enough to get the young lady’s full attention. Don’t you think so?”</p>\n<p>“Young noble is right. Young Lady Bhela’s father once was a gangster thus he didn’t manage to teach common sense to the young lady. I’ll talk to her later to explain what’s really important.”</p>\n<p>After a bit of excuse and fawning, Young Master Blackwood felt this Elder Jhamil was acceptable. He told the Blackwood Family’s servants to bring the gifts he had prepared, which were naturally accepted by Elder Jhamil on the young lady’s behalf. In the meantime, people were disappointed that the drama they were expecting didn’t happen. But what could they do besides shaking their heads and disperse?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Year after year, the ngajen ceremony evolved from stiff sessions of praying ceremony for village safety to the new stylish festivities of foods and happy times for the youngsters, where fads and trends emerge. However big their way of life was changing the conservative major families, Yashura and Elzhier, still pretty much followed the old ways, especially when it came to the prayers. Only Malikh Family amongst the three that eager to embrace the new world that was coming. And by Elder Jhamil’s direction, instead of local shamans, Malikh Family asked help from foreign priests from western orthodox temples from nearby villages to lead the prayer.</p>\n<p>It was all good if one made a progressive decision with the greater good in mind. But here was the problem; orthodox temple priests usually led prayers for abundant harvest, while Ngajen Ceremony was all about calming Selaqs from descending the mountain. These priests probably hadn’t any clue how Selaqs looked like.</p>\n<p>“It was inappropriate for a noble to pray to old Mossack deities they don’t believe in, that was Malikhs’ excuses,'' Mila complained non-stop since they finished praying with other guests. In her hands--like a young mother hugging her baby--were plates of food she had just plundered from Malikh Family’s banquet tables prepared to entertain guests.</p>\n<p>“What deity? Wasn’t the mantra replaced from ancient Mossack prayers to magic spell mantra to calm down Selaq since… I don’t know, fifty years ago?” Romana said. The food in her hands was no less than Mila’s. These two girls seemed to think Malikh Family would regret offending them if they plunder the latter’s prepared feast like no tomorrow.</p>\n<p>“That's what I was saying! We no longer those ancient Mossacks who would sacrifice relatives so Selaqs won’t come down the mountain! Nowadays we’ve been using legit spells to keep all those Selaqs away, and these stupid Malikhs want to change the tradition just to appease some visiting noble? They’d rather avoid their noble guest to be uncomfortable than preventing Selaqs from coming down to chew their stupid brains, hah!”</p>\n<p>Compared to noisy girls beside him, Shira was able to keep his head to his feet. Romana signaled Mila with her eyes when she realized the boy wasn’t so into retaliating against the Malikhs; instead of invading the feast Shira, grabbed Malikh Family’s snacks moderately whenever he could--just like any other normal guests that came here.</p>\n<p>Mila grumbled with a bad mood, faced Shira and said, “Don’t you have something you need to do?”</p>\n<p>“Like what?” Shira hoped this cheeky cousin of his wouldn’t say something about kicking people’s asses again.</p>\n<p>“We can’t wait for something to happen,” she said. “Go ask that bitc--I mean, that fiancée of yours--go ask for a dance. The young’uns are starting to get heated. Look there, one of them couples are dancing. You go join them since that short-haired cunt is your fiancée after all.”</p>\n<p>Mila glanced around for a while before she realized she just had her tongue slipped. She quickly corrected her previous words, “Did I say cunt? I mean short-haired bitch--no, short-haired <em>young lady</em>.”</p>\n<p>“Why don’t you just be honest with yourself here. People have been calling Malikhs much worse here because the foreign priests matter!” Romana laughed.</p>\n<p>At that moment a very young maidservant of Malikh Family just passed by and overheard their conversation. The little maidservant snorted in anger, which made Mila snorted back as a retort.</p>\n<p>“Go, go! Go dance with her!” Mila whispered when she was sure only Shira and Romana were around.</p>\n<p>Shira clicked his tongue. “I don’t even have a single proper conversation with her these past ten years. Why should I go ask her dance out of the blue? Just showing our face around here is enough.”</p>\n<p>“Fool! If she accepted to dance with you then all is good, that would only confirm Malikh Family’s cocky attitude is only because their dipshit brains are getting fried by their own inflated proud ego, nothing serious! But if she ignores you in front of others… heh--she dares!”</p>\n<p>“That’s easy for you to say. If someone you don’t like suddenly asks your hands for a dance, what would you feel later on when you found out refusing means two families become enemies?”</p>\n<p>“Uh-uh, I don’t feel nothing. If he’s my fiancé then it’s my job to go my way out to make it clear in public! Going dancing, going kissing, like a proper damned couple! That’s what the goddamn engagement is all about! Right?”</p>\n<p>Mila ate a cookie and she blinked. Unsure of the previous words she said, she glanced at Romana and murmured, “...right?”</p>\n<p>Romana shrugged.</p>\n<p>But Shira wouldn’t back down easily. He continued arguing, “What if your fiancé is Bony Elzhier, then? Are you going to kiss him to prove he’s your fiancé?”</p>\n<p>Mila hid her gasp.</p>\n<p>“You wanna die?” she pursed her lips. “Listen to me or I’m gonna smack your face!”</p>\n<p>Shira groaned against his cousin’s unreasonableness. But before he could concoct a satisfying retort, Snake and Monkey came out of nowhere.</p>\n<p>“Oh, Young Master Shira,” Monkey came patting him on the shoulder, “it seems you get cuckolded for real this time.”</p>\n<p>People were clapping and whistling as the flashy Young Master Frane Blackwood led Young Lady Bhela Malikh by the hand.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Malikh was entertaining two guests previously, but that bald elder raised a fuss about how she neglected the young noble, so in the end it came to this.”</p>\n<p>Monkey laughed as he teased Shira with his elbow, “They’re going to dance. When two people were dancing in Ngajen Ceremony, that meant they--” he caught the scary experssion on Mila’s face, stopped, “nevermind…”</p>\n<p>“That slut!” Mila hissed.</p>\n<p>This was getting serious. Whenever Mila showed that kind of face something bad would happen. Again, the moment Shira opened his mouth to say something, someone else came to grab him in the shoulder.</p>\n<p>“Brat, your woman is going to cuckold you in public,” said the newcomer, Good-Natured Spirit, who literally came out of the thin air.</p>\n<p>“You too?”</p>\n<p>Shira had a headache. Both Monkey and Snake couldn’t see the annoying Good-Natured Spirit, but the three of them were in harmony in mocking him. They mocked him to the point saying he wouldn’t care would only embarrass him further.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, being led by the hand, Bhela Malikh asked Young Master Blackwood, “What kind of remedy Blackwood Family brought with you?”</p>\n<p>“Why so much in hurry, my young lady?” the young noble gave a laugh and a flash of smile. “No need to worry, Blackwood Family sympathize with the disaster that befell your father, so my mother send me here to personally deliver the medicine Blackwood House had sought far and wide.”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh said nothing more. The Young Master of Blackwood Family pondered as he read the cold expression of the girl, thinking that even with flowers and jewelry gifts, nothing could move this young lady. Such a waste of that beautiful face to not letting a single smile escaped, Young Master Blackwood could only smacked his lips and shook his head. But as soon as he mentioned a medicine he brought for her father, the feisty young lady became amiable almost immediately.</p>\n<p>Good thing for him. Bhela Malikh was talented, the Blackwood Family planned to have her inside their house, and if things went this smoothly he could do that his mother told him sooner than he expected.</p>\n<p>“Little bitch of Malikh Family,” a girl roared, “you finally show your true color you bitch! Is Yashura Family a joke to you?!”</p>\n<p>The furious Mila Yashura became the center of attention. She snorted as she strode, like an angry bull preparing to charge, with the mood that would make the crowd wordlessly give way to her. Not only because they didn’t want anything to do with the infamous young lady of Yashura Family--who, when angry, once punched Bony in the face with a nosebleed--but also because she got a sword in her hands.</p>\n<p>Shira glanced down. His father’s sword he brought with him was gone. He looked again at the unsheated weapon in his cousin’s hands.</p>\n<p>He could only slap his own face the moment he noticed what was happened.</p>\n<p>Mila took a step forward slowly, but her face turned even fiercer. She spoke, “You got guts to bring a lover from outside, eh? I knew something fishy happened when I saw you cut your hair, you little slut.”</p>\n<p>“I cut my hair because it got in the way during my training,” Bhela replied plainly. “And this is not my lover. Just a relative of my friend.”</p>\n<p>“You lying little slut. As if someone like you have any friends!”</p>\n<p>“I do have a friend.” Bhela said. A rare emphasizing tone in her voice was telling that she was upset, but she held back from explaining further.</p>\n<p>“I don’t care what your excuse is! Do you think I don’t know what you shitty Malikhs up to? You already don’t put Yashura Family in your eyes, eh? Just because you bitch have a little vacation outside, eh? If you think you’re a big shot, why don’t you prove it here and now?!”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh was silent for a while. Looking at Mila, she then asked, “And what are you suggesting I should do, Young Lady Yashura?”</p>\n<p>Mila stabbed her sword into the ground.</p>\n<p>“I just want to know how awesome is this Archer class you’ve got overseas that makes you Malikhs stop putting us Yashuras in your eyes,” Mila sneered. “Why don’t we test it with my sword, eh? Let’s do a duel, bitch.”</p>\n<p>Bhela just looked at Mila strangely.</p>\n<p>“But you’re a Specialist class,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Aha! Getting scared, aren’t ya, you little cunt?”</p>\n<p>Bhela didn’t want to argue with her. So she told the nearest servant to go grab a bow.</p>\n<p>On the other side, Monkey anxiously elbowed Shira, said, “Should I drag your cousin back?”</p>\n<p>“Stand down, mister. Mila is the one who’s starting it. She can’t afford to back down now.”</p>\n<p>Beside them Snake was nodding as he understood what Shira meant.</p>\n<p>Then with a laugh, Good-Natured Spirit, who was already tired jeering him, said to Shira. “Kid, shit just got real. Ain’t that a good idea to pull her before it’s too late?”</p>\n<p>Shira wanted to but he couldn’t. He knew exactly Mila’s strength. Fighting bare hands, she might get a chance to stand against the strongest youngster in the village, but it would become a different story when weapons and mana were involved.</p>\n<p>Since Mila was the one to propose the duel, bailing out before the fight began would be slapping her own face in front of the guests. It was a bad idea, because Mila didn’t appear to have the slightest chance to win. So bad that it’d be more reasonable to just surrender. But Shira knew Mila hated to go back on her words the most. Thus he silently moved closer to her, prepared to pull her back in before the situation really got out of his hands.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Young Master Blackwood, was pulled out by an adjutant of his family.</p>\n<p>Smirking, he asked the adjutant, “Who is that girl who picking a fight with Bhela?”</p>\n<p>“Seems like the eldest young lady of that family,” the adjutant replied.</p>\n<p>“You mean the family my Bhela got engaged to?” Young Master Frane Blackwood asked as if Bhela already his. The corner of his lips curled as he thought this might be a good chance to do something on the engagement that Blackwood House already saw as a thorn in their eyes. “Do you have something on that girl?”</p>\n<p>“Replying to young master, since Yashura Family is the main obstacle for us to get Young Lady Bhela Malikh to our side, your mother has already sent someone to investigate them. The eldest young lady of Yashura Family merely a Level 10 Specialist class who just graduated from Novice about seven months ago.”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood couldn’t help but chuckle. Even though the two young ladies had the same level, a Specialist merely support class that wasn’t suited in combat. This duel affair would turn out to be a joke.</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood scoffed. “Let my Bhela teach her some manners. I don’t want anyone to disturb us after this.”</p>\n<p>“Young master,” the adjutant lowered his voice, “I don’t think that’s a good idea.”</p>\n<p>“What’s on your mind, adjutant?”</p>\n<p>“I just made a round to check the guests attending this ceremony, and I found…”--he lowered his voice--“...some spectators amongst the guests that shouldn’t have be here….”</p>\n<p>“Go on,” the young noble urged.</p>\n<p>“I just received the word, young master, there are experts that Elder Jhamil said he didn’t invite.”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood frowned. “What… what’s that supposed to mean?”</p>\n<p>On the less crowded place of the courtyard, the middle-aged man who Bhela greeted before, along with the middle-aged woman, watched the commotion unfold while nibbling on steamed peanuts. He glanced at the other place where a man calmly sipping tea, a man with a hard face who couldn’t hide his sharp aura, then swept his gaze at the one who beside him, a short stature man who wore a headband to hide his reddish hair from public, who also happened to enjoy steamed peanuts while his focus solely at one direction in the crowd.</p>\n<p>All of them came in common garments incognito. But still Elder Jhamil sent people to keep tabs on them, especially since the bald elder still didn’t know the reason Bhela Malikh invited these foreigners.</p>\n<p>The ngajen ceremony usually consisted of three main parts--prayer, socializing, and sending offerings to the mountain as the finale. It was uncommon for irrelevant events to happen between them. However, since the young lady of the host had already accepted the duel, Malikh Family set up an emergency venue for the fight.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil came to invite himself as the judge. For a change to hummiliate those simple Yashuras and to slip himself onto the spotlight, he couldn’t ask for better opportunity.</p>\n<p>“You two ready?” Elder Jhamil asked both of the opposing sides. “This is a friendly match between two friendly families. So stop before your blade hit your enemy,” he said, seemingly talking to either sides, but didn’t say anything about the arrows part.</p>\n<p>Since Bhela Malikh was an Archer, she suggested to Mila, “I’m using a bow. So you can move first. I’ll try to dodge for ten seconds.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t need that,” Mila scoffed.</p>\n<p>“Very well…” she said. She glanced at Elder Jhamil, said, “Elder Jhamil, please begin the duel.&quot;</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil counted to three.</p>\n<p>The duel began.</p>\n<p>“AAAAAA!!!” Mila roared with the sword raised above her head, charging ahead.</p>\n<p>Contrast to her opponent’s battle cry, Bhela was solemn. She picked four arrows from the quiver tied on her hips. Nocking the arrows simultaneously, she took a deep breath as she concentrated to channel different natures elemental mana from her manasphere. The mana, through fingers and her thumb, flowing into all the four arrows and soon the tip of the arrows glowed with four different colors.</p>\n<p>The wind began to stir.</p>\n<p>And she raised the bow. She released the arrows.</p>\n<p><em>Fuuush fuuuushhh fuuushh shhuuuuusshh!</em></p>\n<p>Before even everyone noticed what happened, the mana Bhela channeled melted the flying arrows, within a span of milliseconds, turning them into dangerous magic projectiles of four elemental natures--fire, water, wind and lightning.</p>\n<p>Mila was confident before. She knew a trick against an Archer, but here she was dumbfounded by magic arrows coming to blast her way. She thought she was fighting an Archer, but got up against a Mage instead. This wasn’t what she signed up for.</p>\n<p><em>Clank!</em></p>\n<p>The first blue arrow dissapeared almost the moment it reached Mila. The sound of metallic clash that followed the said arrow resounded three more times, and the three arrows left behind too disappeared almost immediately. Mila, thought she ought to dodge the magic arrows, leap a step backward, but her hasty movement combined with the slippery mud made her slipped her foothold, accidentally fell to her butt instead.</p>\n<p>Bhela aimed down her bow. Everyone was staring at her with complicated and questioning gaze, as an Archer who could do magic, this was the first time everyone witnessed it.</p>\n<p>“It’s a four elemental affinity spell!” someone’s voice roared through the silenced venue, “I heard it, I doubted it, but she really did it!”</p>\n<p>Everyone looked at his way, the man who shouted, and saw that it was the middle-aged man whom Bhela invited from outside the village. He sat eating steamed peanuts then, now he was standing perplexed.</p>\n<p>Bhela, realizing that the man was the center of the attention, and bow to him from afar.</p>\n<p>“She really did it…” the man said under his breath.</p>\n<p>Someone who sat beside him said, “Sure she did, the only one right now--I guess now that you big brain from Elemental Stone School witnessed it I guess you can die without regret?”</p>\n<p>The man looked at the woman who accompanied him, he said still with expression of disbelieve, “It’s a four elemental affinity spell…”</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, you already said that.”</p>\n<p>The last and the most famous multi elemental Unique Class was, a mage with three elemental affinity skills, died of old age--was actually the headmaster of Elemental Stone School from seventy years ago. As a scholar and a mage researching deeply in topics of elemental mana all of his career, how could he didn’t know the value of a Unique Class who surpassed even the ex-headmaster of his school?</p>\n<p>“I can’t believe someone without a Mage Unique Class really did it…”</p>\n<p>“The most promising talent of this generation, alright, the first time I witnessed an Archer could do magic,” the woman said. “Good thing she stopped her arrows then--if not, the other girl would ended up so pitiful.”</p>\n<p>As the woman said that, someone else blurted not far away from there.</p>\n<p>“She didn’t stop it.”</p>\n<p>“Pardon? Sir Kurusiya?” the woman asked.</p>\n<p>The one she was talking to was the quiet man with sharp aura. He said as a matter of fact like tone, “She didn’t stop it. Someone else did,” he sipped his tea, and when the woman still confused, he explained with hoarse voice, “those are magic, but they were still arrows shot from a bow. You can’t stop flying arrows. That girl calculated and slightly missed her aim as to not hurting her opponent. But she didn’t plan to stop it.”</p>\n<p>The woman questioned him, “If she wasn’t the one who stopped it, then would you know why the arrows disappears?”</p>\n<p>The man put down his glass of tea. “I don’t know. Why you ask me? Ask that fool there who’s been grinning all the time.”</p>\n<p>The woman, along with the middle-aged man from Stone Elemental School, looked up to the bearded foreigner.</p>\n<p>“She’s not the one who stopped it,” the bearded man said with a smile.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Mila, who mellowed from her defeat and still sat on the muddy ground, gulped as she saw her cousin come to pick her up.</p>\n<p>“I lost,” she said to Shira.</p>\n<p>“No you didn’t, that girl is the one who put down her bow first, and you still got your swords in your hands--so technically you’d win.”</p>\n<p>“I fell to my butt, I was humiliated,” Mila said, her voice trembled, “I lost….”</p>\n<p>Shira sighed. He grabbed Mila’s hand and pulled her up. “It’s adult problems from hereon, Uncle Shuro would likely summon my father back. For now, let’s get out of here,” he said.</p>\n<p>Monkey and Snake, along with the nervous Romana, came to follow them from behind to shield them from people’s laughter. Mila was so humiliated the usually feisty tomboy was so down she couldn’t afford to hold her head straight. As Shira witnessed how pitiful his cousin was, regret overwhelming him when he remembered how he was holding back from taking action himself.</p>\n<p>“Brat,” someone called him.</p>\n<p>Shira turned his head. It was Good-Natured Spirit.</p>\n<p>“You owe me this time,” the Nalaq said.</p>\n<p>Shira nodded.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>“Hear ye hear ye people! Gather around and hear me announce something incredible, people! Gather around, will ya!”</p>\n<p>Standing on top of a table, Elder Jhamil shouted to gather people, announcing something that the Young Master of Blackwood Family passed him beforehands. “Although winner of the duel is Young Lady Bhela, Young Master Frane of Blackwood House is concerned by some stupid unruly girl of the supposed biggest family in Badril Village behavior would smear my young lady--”</p>\n<p>“Big news! Big news!” someone else’s shouting cut off Elder Jhamil’s announcement, “Young Master Bonithon is running around beating people! Watch your mouth if you don’t want get beaten for no reason!”</p>\n<p>“Bony is going crazy! He’s going to kick people’s asses! Nobody knows why!”</p>\n<p>“What the fuck is going on! Why Elzhier Family messing with us Malikhs now?”</p>\n<p>At the chaotic scene before him, Elder Jhamil’s face showed a frown and a hint of hesitation. He then cleared his phlegm anyway, trying to get people’s attention, then pushed on announcing carefully, “Young Master Frane Blackwood is concerned that--”</p>\n<p>“Elder Jhamil!!” a servant came running with a horrified expression, “Bony is coming for you, run away!”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil pointed his finger at the servant and roared, “What is that brat from Elzhier Family wants to do with me! Go kick him out, I’m trying to tell everybody something important here!”</p>\n<p>“But he doesn’t listen to reasons! He’s going to punch your face, is what he said just now!”</p>\n<p>“Imbecile! Do you think a young master would jump around like a monkey and punch an elder of another family in the damn face?! He’s making ruckus. Go on, kick him out!”</p>\n<p>Looking at the crowd from the rushedly made stage, he then smiled and continued, “Right, everybody, it’s Young Master of Blackwood Family; what I’m saying is that since Young Lady Bhela Malikh is winning with ease against the foolish young lady of <em>that</em> family, Young Master Blackwood concerned that some people would shrug my young lady’s victory. So he proposed, in order to make it clear the disparity between Malikh and--sheesh--Yashura, he proposed that him as a friendly representative of Malikh Family and Shira Yashura as the repre--”</p>\n<p>“Elder Jhamil--watch out!”</p>\n<p>He had it taking from lowly servants who cut off his announcement. Fuming in anger, Elder Jhamil pointed his finger toward the one who was spriting toward him and roared, “How many times I told you to just kick him out! Shut your trap and go kick the damned brat!”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was losing his cool. But what he failed to realize in time was that the one who sprinted toward him wasn’t a servant from his family. It was not the one who telling him to run away. And before he knew it, someone leaped up on the table where he was standing and delivered a punch to the face.</p>\n<p>“Gaaahhh!”</p>\n<p>Even after Elder Jhamil stumbled down the table he stood on, his assaulter didn’t plan to let him go. And what came after that was a torrent of hardened fist, pummeling his face even though he screamed for mercy. Only when the chaotic crowd succeeded in saving him did Elder Jhamil see the assaulter’s face--it was indeed the Young Master from Elzhier Family.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Bonithon… what did you… why did you do this… for what reason?!” Elder Jhamil choked out his grievance.</p>\n<p>Bony, the man who beat the bald elder black and blue, replied with nothing but a cold stare. Instead, it was an almost incoherent voice of Pilek who answered instead.</p>\n<p>“Kekekek, don’t be angry Elder Baldy! We just discussed how you were a splendid Pugilist a long time ago, so Boss Bony came here to find out whether it was true or not! That’s why he asked you to a barehand duel!” Pilek came in with a swagger and a bottle of booze in his hand. From a single glance anybody could tell he was drunk.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s lips trembled. What duel? That brat just leaped out of nowhere without saying anything, then immediately beating him black and blue!</p>\n<p>The only one from the three delinquents who hadn’t had the smell of liquor from his body was Polio. He wore an apologetic smile, and with a slight sigh, he said, “Please forgive them, dear kind Malikh sirs, my friends are terrible when they are drunk.”</p>\n<p>Polio made a round to apologize to any Malikhs he saw. But the Malikh Family didn’t appreciate his gesture, receiving jeerings in return.</p>\n<p>Polio was a patient young man, but Pilek wasn’t. The drunk Pilek didn’t take their attitude kindly, randomly walking to a servant, said, “Hah? What the fuck are you staring me at, you no-name Malikh servant? Wanna die, eh? Huuuraah!!!”</p>\n<p><em>Shatter!</em></p>\n<p>Without a warning he swung the booze in his hand to a Malikh family servant. The man he attacked stumbled backward holding his bloodied head from the crash Pilek gave him.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Bhela Malikh had just settled greeting four foreign guests that she invited from outside, and was on her way to fetch cuisines from the kitchen to humor her guests, then she witnessed the chaotic brawl unfold with a crowdful of cheers and jeers mixed in between. Perhaps there were more than a dozen men involved, with the Malikhs servants, guards, common family members even an elder came along to surround Bony and his two underlings.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela…” a little maidservant with a crest of Elzhier Family in her uniform bowed to Bhela politely.</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at her. She returned the bow even though the other party clearly was a servant. “Miss Elzhier,” she spoke softly.</p>\n<p>“No need to be polite to this servant, Young Lady.”</p>\n<p>“I can’t be impolite to Sister Ryntia’s friends.”</p>\n<p>The Elzhier Family maidservant smiled. Since Bhela insisted, then she wouldn’t be bowing her head anymore.</p>\n<p>She said, “Eldest Young Lady sends me to ask for your forgiveness for her brother’s brashness, Young Lady Bhela.”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at the brawl that started in her family’s courtyard. This chaos would spell imperfect on tonight's Malikh Family’s Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>“There’s no need for that. Since I accepted Young Lady Mila Yashura’s duel then I somewhat anticipated Young Master Bonithon will follow suit to make trouble tonight. If anything, it is I the one who should apologize to Sister Ryntia because I couldn’t handle the situation well. Please tell her that I’ll try to maintain friendship between Malikh and Elzhier Family.”</p>\n<p>Still with the serene smile on her face, the Elzhier Family maidservant studied the expression on Bhela’s face. She spoke a moment after, “Then I’ll let Eldest Young Lady Elzhier knows by tomorrow.”</p>\n<p>“Thanks,” Bhela offered her gratitude with a bow.</p>\n<p>By this time, the brawl became anything but intensified, as men either from Elzhier Family or thugs that previously had dealings with Bony’s group came in to reinforce the Elzhier young master. Before the Malikhs could pressure the intruders with numbers, but then the completely overwhelmed by the new reinforcement.</p>\n<p>“Huurraaahh!” Pilek sent a Malikh man flying with his kick. “Where the fuck your previous cocky taunt? Cat got your tongue, eh?”</p>\n<p>The only unspoken rules in brawls were strictly no usage of mana and spell as well as no sharp objects to use as weapons. But when it was chaotic and nobody could watch everybody the sharpest mind with tricks the one who prevailed--this is why the likes of Pilek and his friend Polio who always struck in place people wouldn’t be willing the one who were taking the advantage in brawls. Even hunters and seasoned guards were no match against these naughty brats.</p>\n<p>For example, when Pilek’s punch was blocked by Elder Jhamil’s son, “You shitty brat, just wait till I deal with your father--kuukgghh!”</p>\n<p>And because no one was watching, Pilek used his knee to strike the cocky young elder in the balls.</p>\n<p>With a sad whimper from his trembling lips, Elder Jhamil’s son curled onto the ground holding his precious balls that Polio struck.</p>\n<p>Seeing that a family elder was mercilessly defeated, a few Malikhs came to avenge their young elder. By then, Pilek already had Polio watching over his back.</p>\n<p>At that point, no Malikhs could match them in hand-in-hand brawl.</p>\n<p>A stranger then casually walked in. Pilek stopped, looking at him, and amidst the chaotic scene it took a while for him to find out that the man was actually a foreigner--an eastern Kaya man. The man had a sheathed sword on his hips. But Pilek wasn’t afraid as long as he stick with the brawl rules to use only fighting unarmed.</p>\n<p>“Huurraaah!”</p>\n<p>Pilek threw a feint. Most simple Malikhs would fall for this. But the eastern Kaya man didn’t budge. Seemed to even anticipate it. With a movement too fast for Pilek to follow the man grabbed his wrist, flicked him and sent him into the air like it was nothing.</p>\n<p>It was only after Pilek rolled in the mud he realized what had happened.</p>\n<p>The man then glanced aside and walked toward Polio who in his own right was too engrossed with the brawl. With his left hand pushing Polio’s shoulder and the other hand grabbing his wrist, he flipped Polio just like he did Pilek beforehand.</p>\n<p>Pilek and a few others that the man previously flipped were amazed by how effortlessly the man disabling enthusiastic young men from fighting.</p>\n<p>The sword handle the man had was wrapped with cloth and its body too thin for regular blades. Those who noticed this would understand that the man wasn’t an ordinary Kaya. Polio was one of them.</p>\n<p>“A Samurai!” he exclaimed a moment after he got thrown onto the muddy ground.</p>\n<p>The Kaya man stopped, looking at him, then spoke with a displeased tone, “I am but a masterless ronin.”</p>\n<p>The man then continued walking toward a different direction.</p>\n<p>Bony was fighting with three men alone, so he couldn’t afford to look around. He didn’t realize the Kaya man at first, but when the man tried to grab the wild young master’s wrist, Bony reacted--he reacted by throwing a punch to the man’s face.</p>\n<p>The man slapped his flying fist from the side, tremendously muffled its momentum. Again, he tried to grab Bony’s wrist and his shoulder. Bony tried resisting but the man’s speed was too fast for him to compete.</p>\n<p>As the man prepared to flip him, Bony felt a faint gush of the wind from his legs. It didn’t take him a second to realize the man just putting his hand on his shoulder as a feint--his real target was to gently nudge his foot on rooting from the ground, which, if he’d focus his effort to get his shoulder free from the man’s grasp, a small window of opening that could be used by his opponent to disrupt his sense of balance. Thus Bony firmly stomped his feet to the ground instead. He grabbed the man’s sleeve to make his opponent not be able to easily throw like Pilek and Polio.</p>\n<p>Responding to Bony’s choice, the man curled the corner of his lips. Bony caught a hint of taunt when he staring the man in the eyes.</p>\n<p>“Kkuuuggghh!”</p>\n<p>Bony did succeed in preventing himself get flipped to the ground. But he got struck in the gut instead.</p>\n<p>The man didn’t let him go. The moment Bony stepping backward due to shock having stricken, the man was charging and got his wrist in the blink of the eyes--what happened afterward was Bony got his feet swept and he completely lost his ground, and got cheered by his friends as the last man who got thrown into the mud.</p>\n<p>Bony then sat there looking as the fight stopped; since someone took him down, more and less the Malikhs had won the brawl.</p>\n<p>“Aren’t you Thoqek’s son?” the Kaya man asked Bony.</p>\n<p>Bony wasn’t willing to open his mouth when his father’s name got mentioned.</p>\n<p>Receiving no answer, the man thus carelessly said, “Unexpectedly, you’ve got more guts than your father. Get up now, and stop making trouble in Ghalim Malikh’s home.”</p>\n<p>The young ruffians with Bony as the leader naturally wouldn’t be arrogant anymore since they had been defeated. They retreated calmly, and the Malikhs didn’t dare taunt them the second time in case Bony would change his mind and started on a rampage again. In the end, the real reason why Bony came targeting Malikh Family, as many people knew, was that he wasn’t a drinker that would lose reason to punch another family’s elder in the face.</p>\n<p>Speaking about an elder who got a punch in the face; after Bony and others were gone, Elder Jhamil showed his nose out of his hiding place. He gritted his teeth. He swore he’d use his full resource to get back from Bony’s father in the next village council meeting.</p>\n<p>“Elder Jhamil, you still haven’t announced the thing I ask you to do,” from behind, the sullen young noble Frane Blackwood said to him.</p>\n<p>“Y-young Master Blackwood, please spare me--the mood isn’t that good to draw people’s attention after that kid crashing our Ngajen Ceremony just now. How about I brief it to other village leaders tomorrow in the village council meeting?”</p>\n<p>“No, I want everyone to know it by tonight. This is the right time and the right place to announce it. Besides, I want to see what kind of a young man the one who’s supposed to be my rival.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil didn’t want to show his beaten face to the crowd tonight. But as much as he love his face he knew flattery wouldn’t get him out of this situation--at least not if he didn’t want to offend the young noble. And so with a heavy face he climbed the table once again, hiding off his reluctancy.</p>\n<p>Someone heartily made a joke on him, “Elder Jhamil, we thought you’re a man who care about face the most--I don’t expect you to boldly show how handsome you’ve become now!”</p>\n<p>“Kids nowadays getting big headed by their privileges as young masters--naturally I’ll let their fathers know how to discipline their brats!” Elder Jhamil coldly said. “Anyway, you all know that my Young Lady Bhela is a girl with talent and her future is boundless. Here in Malikh Family we’re not willing to throw our princess to cow’s dunk that is Yashura Family’s trash young master. And our friend Young Noble Frane Blackwood also thinks the same!”</p>\n<p>Such passionate speech, naturally people were cheering in anticipation of the next spectacle they thought they were going to witness.</p>\n<p>Getting the cue from Elder Jhamil, Frane Blackwood came forward with a swagger. “I speak this as a close friend of Young Lady Bhela Malikh. Someone with the name of Shira Yashura; if you think you’re worthy of her, do you dare to prove it by having a duel with me?!”</p>\n<p>The crowd was silent. They were waiting for the reply.</p>\n<p>Frane Blackwood swept the crowd with his eyes.</p>\n<p>Someone said to him the boy he challenged was utter trash. He was amused guessing how this trash would respond to his duel challenge, especially when Bhela Malikh had just completely defeated the cheeky young lady from his family.</p>\n<p>There were already murmurs spreading. People were also curious whether Shira was going to accept or run away from it.</p>\n<p>And then…</p>\n<p>“<em>Cough, cough…</em>” someone awkwardly stepped forward with a wry smile plastered on his face. People recognized his face, which looked like a monkey, and many of them had seen him together with Shira Yashura.</p>\n<p>He was Monkey. He said, “This young noble… about your proposed duel… I’m afraid Young Master Shira Yashura can’t answer it tonight.”</p>\n<p>Frane Blackwood laughed. “Why? He’s scared? His cousin challenged Young Lady Bhela to a duel for no apparent reason; don’t tell me we can do the same to them?”</p>\n<p>“No, it’s not that.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil pointed his finger at Monkey. “We all know Shira Yashura is a trash who can’t even advance to Level 4 Novice! Young Master Frane Blackwood is kind. Tonight, he’s going to give Shira one chance to admit that he’s unworthy of Young Lady Bhela Malikh to the crowd here. He does that, and there will be no need for Young Master Frane Blackwood to embarrass him by kicking his ass!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, but he can’t give you an answer tonight,” Monkey insisted.</p>\n<p>Now it was Elder Jhamil who laughed. “He’s really scared facing Young Master Frane right now?!”</p>\n<p>“No…”</p>\n<p>“Then why?”</p>\n<p>Monkey sighed.</p>\n<p>“Because he’s already gone home!”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was furious. The whole point he had to gather people even though his face had been beaten by Bony was to call out the boy and embarrass him in public, as per the young noble request. But the said person himself already went home, so Elder Jhamil standing on top of the table was for nothing.</p>\n<p>Immediately he ordered a servant to send the message to Yashura Family, while in between, cursing the fact that he didn’t get the chance to distract the guests from discussing the previous brawl. Sure enough, not only the people were talking about Bhela Malikh’s hidden Unique Class, they were also talking about Bony, and people he beat to pulp, especially Elder Jhamil. People no longer cared to gossip about Young Lady Mila Yashura who had been sent home defeated, but they laughed at someone present who had just his misfortune like Elder Jhamil instead.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil had lost his face in the end. Literally and metaphorically.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, with a solemn expression Monkey looked at his partner Snake who was enjoying the banquet and had amused himself watching the spectacle previously.</p>\n<p>Monkey said with a whisper, “Why the hell your family doesn’t show his face when they dumping shit to Young Master and Young Lady Yashura just now?!”</p>\n<p>Snake glanced at him lazily. “I don’t know. They said they were going to diagnose Patriarch Ghalim Malikh previously.”</p>\n<p>“Can’t you just fetch your brother instead? Didn’t you put your words to assure young master before this? What if he thinks we’re people who put our words lightly?”</p>\n<p>“The one who’s diagnosing the patriarch is my grandfather, my brother supposed to be free enough to be a busybody just now,” Snake said, displeased by Monkey’s tone accusing him of being unloyal to his own word.</p>\n<p>Actually, he also confused why his brother didn’t show his nose when Young Lady Mila recklessly brought a sword to challenge Bhela to a duel. From his understanding of his brother’s character and the relationship between his family and Yashura from what he knew told him that more or less his brother was going to back Yashura if the drama with Malikh Family intensified. But he didn’t. Snake would barge into Malikh Family’s doors to look for his grandfather if he knew it was going to be like this instead.</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-4/chapter-4":"<p>Badril Village, though had been two years passed without her presence, was the same as always for Bhela Malikh. She hadn’t that many acquaintances her age she could consider friendly before. In spite of that, from the day she returned, people act as if they were her rekindled childhood friends she never knew she had.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” a daughter of an elder from Elzhier Family asked curiously, “is the rumor about that story true?”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at her with eyelids half-closed.</p>\n<p>“Which rumor?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, silly you, of course <em>that</em> rumor! The one about your romance with a blue blood noble!”</p>\n<p>Giggles of girls followed after the girl’s words. When Bhela returned to Badril Village she brought not only fame and reputation, but interesting stories and rumors as well. She was currently surrounded by curious young ladies who sought for exciting gossip.</p>\n<p>“Yeah, yeah!” another girl excitedly hussing in low voice. “I heard he’ll attend Malikh’s ngajen ceremony tonight!”</p>\n<p>“Really?”</p>\n<p>“Why else would Young Lady Bhela take the Chef Chief position if she didn’t expect for her lover to come tonight? He’ll come for sure!”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, yeah, everybody is saying Young Lady Bhela doing just for that!”</p>\n<p>Bhela found it was amazing how people could conjure their own rumors despite not seeing the true story by their own eyes.</p>\n<p>And just when the young ladies started getting excited discussing Young Lady Bhela’s ‘love life’, a vigorous shout resounded the courtyard announcing that Blackwood Family had arrived.</p>\n<p>“Blackwood Family?” someone cocked their head and looked over the direction of the gate. “What kind of family is so bold announcing their names in other family’s ngajen ceremony? Not even Village Head’s Elzhier Family would do to the ceremony host!”</p>\n<p>“Only foreigners to be that stupid to be rude in big family like Malikh! If this is my place I’d send a guard to kick their ass out as soon as possible!”</p>\n<p>“Look over there! Malikh Family elders are rushing to the gate! Let’s check out how’s Malikhs going to deal with it!”</p>\n<p>Curious guests were tailing the elders to see some commotion they thought would occur. However, not only did the Malikhs not make a fuss over it, they even bowed their heads toward the newly arrived noble as if they were servants greeting their returning master. Young people were overly excited because nobles were foreign and appeared in stories all of their lives.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Mila, who already went back with her friend, was gritting teeth with anger. Beside her Romana was holding the tomboy back, though concerned she didn't say a word.</p>\n<p>“Why should I am the one who always had to hold myself back?” Mila hissed in a low voice as if she was wronged.</p>\n<p>“Look around and think about who’s receiving the blow the most. Everyone’s talking about your cousin right now--do you want to make it worse for him?”</p>\n<p>After hearing her friend’s warning, Mila began to take a deep breath and think things through. Romana was right. When she opened her ears Mila could hear people comparing the young master of this noble Blackwood Family with her cousin Shira. They compared such a gallant-looking young noble with a trash of Yashura Family young master, adding with their own biased seasoning here and there, making her cousin Shira look really bad. Mila trembled as her face boiled red from holding back her anger.</p>\n<p>“Where’s Shira right now?”</p>\n<p>“I think he went hiding!” Romana said.</p>\n<p>“Hiding?! He’s embarrassed to show his face that much?”</p>\n<p>After circling around a bit, Mila found the boy’s silhouette in the shadow far from the braziers' light. There, he was squatting, hiding along with two other silhouettes who were also squatting in a suspicious manner.</p>\n<p>“Now, young master, where the hell did you get this coin?” someone whispered from the suspicious bunch.</p>\n<p>The reply came also in the same hushed manner. “Don’t ask me now, just know I’ve got a few more hidden in my house. I can’t move my family, but if you’re fine with this, I can invest in your goods earlier.”</p>\n<p>“We’re fine? Of course we’re fine! Don’t you know how amazing this coin is?”</p>\n<p>“It’s amazing? I can’t even buy satays with this. Nobody here would receive unfamiliar currency.”</p>\n<p>“But don’t you know how far ahead you can go if merchants know you grab some of these coins?”</p>\n<p>“You tell me.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, these coins weren’t issued by any countries, but they’re valuable. Lots of herbs and ingredients in the black markets can only be bought with these coins...”</p>\n<p><em>...whisper whisper whisper...</em></p>\n<p>Mila approached.</p>\n<p>“Ey, what are you doing?!”</p>\n<p>For some reasons, Shira and Monkey, one of his companions, almost jumped in fright by her barking. Both Mila and Romana behind her saw Shira and Monkey were acting suspicious--but Sneak, the third silhouette, didn’t even try to hide that he was nibbling on something delicious.</p>\n<p>Mila, with a weird face, hissed, “Is that… <em>rendang</em> you guys were eating?”</p>\n<p>“<em>Cough, cough,</em>” hiding the opened wrapping banana leaves, Shira awkwardly trying to make an excuse, “I think Malikh Family is too eager to cut off relationships with our Yashura Family so… I reckon they don’t need this anymore…”</p>\n<p>Mila was so angry she slapped the banana leaves in Shira’s hand.</p>\n<p>“Ah, my rendang…”</p>\n<p>“Your rendang?! You goddamn moron!” Mila hissed, she didn’t dare to roar and announce themselves to other guests. “You’re about to get cuckolded and all you think about is a goddamn rendang?!”</p>\n<p>“Young master, someone trying to get you cuckolded?” licking his fingers for some leftover rendang sauce, Snake asked from the side.</p>\n<p>Shira shook his head. “Cuckold is a very strong word. That girl didn’t even consider me from the beginning. It’s not like we're a married couple yet.”</p>\n<p>He then came to pick the spoiled beef and mourned, “ah… my poor rendang.”</p>\n<p>“Stop crying over that shit! It’s not important!”</p>\n<p>Monkey blurted, “Rendang is not important?”</p>\n<p>Mila glared at Monkey. The monkey-faced peddler closed his mouth as soon as he opened it.</p>\n<p>Romana saw her friend Mila had a bad affinity with her cousin whenever she was angry, thus came to explain from the side, “Young Master Shira, don’t you know people outside the Mossack culture do take engagement seriously? It’s understandable for a young heir of a conservative family like Yashura to not care much about it--but, whatever your feelings regarding your engagement is, if Young Lady Bhela has an affair outside, she’ll also drag down Yashura Family’s reputation. So please be mindful about it more for the sake of your family.”</p>\n<p>They didn’t really think about this deeply since straightforward Mossack people were the type to have children before they were even married. If things went awry, Shira reckoned his uncle and the elders in his family might think the engagement matter was similar to puppy love, about children bantering, but the young generation who was exposed to stories and gossips from books and travellers might think about it differently. And someone who didn’t hang out so much like Shira wouldn’t be able to tell how these youngsters would talk about this incident in the future.</p>\n<p>So Shira stood up and patted his trouser, admitted, “Ah, you’re right, Romana.”</p>\n<p>Mila crossed her arms. Frowning at her cousin. “What are you gonna do now? Fight them? No need to be afraid, I’m with you.”</p>\n<p>Snake, still squatting comfortably, added, “Young Master, my grandfather and my older brother are still here too. You won’t be at a disadvantage in case things go downhill.”</p>\n<p>“It’s decided. Let’s kick their asses!” Mila growled.</p>\n<p>“The heck are you talking about kicking people’s asses in Ngajen Ceremony?” Shira grunted.</p>\n<p>“Then at least let me slap that slut’s arrogant face!”</p>\n<p>Shira shook his head.</p>\n<p>“Let’s go,” he said.</p>\n<p>“We’re gonna slap her face now?” Mila asked.</p>\n<p>“No. We at least have to make Family Yashura’s presence known here,” Shira said. He caught his companions’ confused expressions, so he added, “Everyone is getting excited because most of them are young'uns. But if this incident gets out of the hands, the elders from other families won’t be silent about it.”</p>\n<p>Mila wanted to say something but didn’t after seeing Shira’s relaxed face. She didn’t want to say something silly that’d change the boy’s mind. Therefore, with Shira leading the way, she and her friend Romana went to see the ruckus caused by the noble’s arrival. Leaving Monkey and Sneak who were silent looking at their back.</p>\n<p>The two exchanged glances.</p>\n<p>They looked down, eyes sweeping the ground.</p>\n<p>“Mm?” Monkey mumbled, his hands crawling all over the dirt.</p>\n<p>Snake took out a magic wand. The wand shimmered with a gentle light, then he used that to give some light to the ground where the rendang was spoiled.</p>\n<p>But it was Monkey who shouted in joy, “I got one!”</p>\n<p>“Give me that!” Snake pounced the moment he saw Monkey rubbed the dirt of a piece of rendang.</p>\n<p>Pushing out Snake’s face from grabbing the rendang in his hand, Monkey felt wronged and cried, “Why would a rich gentleman like you fight over a single beef with this poor peddler? Don’t you know my family can only afford to eat beef once a year?”</p>\n<p>“Why, you asked?” Snake sneered, “There’s no need to say the obvious. You don’t get to eat Patriarch Shuro’s handmade rendang everyday! And I’m saying this after starving for beef ever since I’m following you.”</p>\n<p>“Fuck off!”</p>\n<p>“Give me that!”</p>\n<p>“No!”</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the shadowy corner where they were wrestling came to be lightened up with a lit torch.</p>\n<p>“Ehem, you two gentlemen,” a voice called.</p>\n<p>For a moment, Monkey and Snake stopped fighting.</p>\n<p>The voice owner was a man with Malikh Family’s servant uniform. Reluctantly, he continued, “Badril Village locals are usually open-minded and tolerant people. However, we have a bottom line. If you two couldn’t hold it you should rent some inn room or do it in the bushes! Don’t do it in the open, you’re making people uncomfortable! Know some shame!”</p>\n<p>Monkey at first didn’t get what the servant was talking about. Then he realized during infighting over the rendang, he had opened his legs, and Snake was on top of him in a very, very awkward manner.</p>\n<p>“Dammit!” he kicked Snake and trembling over the horror he caught himself in. But suddenly he noticed the rendang in his hand already vanished. He whirled his head around. Snake was already licking his fingers with a satisfied face.</p>\n<p>“Dammit!” Monkey howled again.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The one who enthusiastically greeted the young noble of Blackwood Family was Elder Jhamil instead of Bhela Malikh. He managed to conjure thirty years worth of bullshitting skills to flatter and fawn over the other party, rather thick faced to continue despite the young master of noble family rolled his eyes several times. As soon as the young noble caught the sight of a short-haired girl he immediately escaped from Elder Jhamil’s clutch with a big grin on his face.</p>\n<p>“Ah, Sister Bhela!”</p>\n<p>“Young Master Frane Blackwood.”</p>\n<p>“How are you doing Young Lady Bhela? Fancy to meet you again,” he said as he gifted the girl a flower.</p>\n<p>Bhela received the flower but then immediately passed it to a random maidservant beside her. She said as if it was nothing, “I’m fine. Thank you.”</p>\n<p>Young Master Frane Blackwood smiled wryly. “I’ve been travelling with hardly any rest so that I can see you sooner, my young lady,” the young master of Blackwood Family, Frane Blackwood, said, “may I be so lucky to receive your company tonight?”</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry, but here the words ‘tonight’s companion’ have different meanings than when you say it in the western-style ball--so, no, Young Master Blackwood, I can’t give you company tonight,” she said.</p>\n<p>The young noble still had a smile and wanted to correct his wording, but Bhela suddenly raised her hand and said, “Excuse me.”</p>\n<p>She went past him and greeted another pair of guests instead.</p>\n<p>“Greeting, sir, madam.”</p>\n<p>“It’s about time,” the middle-aged man didn’t answer Bhela’s greeting, but complained instead. “You know the other families had begun their ceremonies, right? Even though we don’t have the same ceremony as your Ngajen Ceremony from the place where I come from, but I know those who don’t take any old ceremonies seriously only brought bad luck over their lands.”</p>\n<p>There was a rare restraint in Bhela’s voice as she replied, “I apologize for our bad conduct, Sir Instructor. I will request the elders to proceed with the ceremony. Please let me lead you toward the reserved spot I previously prepared for both of you.”</p>\n<p>“Lead the way then.”</p>\n<p>Badril Village locals witnessed the valiant Young Lady of Malikh Family taking charge of the Ngajen Ceremony as the Chief Chef, but with the appearance of her bowing to two unfamiliar guests as well, whispers were floating amongst the Ngajen Ceremony guests. Before long, everyone knew that two guests Bhela Malikh greeted were the ones she personally invited, but was neglected before the family’s gate because of the excitement made by the noble’s arrival. Bhela came to them to apologize in person.</p>\n<p>Young Master Frane Blackwood, who felt ignored, pulled a self-decrepitating sneer. He complained to Elder Jhamil instead, “Oh, Malikh Family elder, can you tell me the identity of those two guests who made even Young Lady Bhela to bow her head?”</p>\n<p>“Ehem, ehem,” Elder Jhamil didn’t know what to answer, so he concocted a reply out of thin air, “I think they were relatives from her maternal family.”</p>\n<p>“Is that so? From the way they are dressed, they don’t look from that respectable background enough to get the young lady’s full attention. Don’t you think so?”</p>\n<p>“Young noble is right. Young Lady Bhela’s father once was a gangster thus he didn’t manage to teach common sense to the young lady. I’ll talk to her later to explain what’s really important.”</p>\n<p>After a bit of excuse and fawning, Young Master Blackwood felt this Elder Jhamil was acceptable. He told the Blackwood Family’s servants to bring the gifts he had prepared, which were naturally accepted by Elder Jhamil on the young lady’s behalf. In the meantime, people were disappointed that the drama they were expecting didn’t happen. But what could they do besides shaking their heads and disperse?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Year after year, the ngajen ceremony evolved from stiff sessions of praying ceremony for village safety to the new stylish festivities of foods and happy times for the youngsters, where fads and trends emerge. However big their way of life was changing the conservative major families, Yashura and Elzhier, still pretty much followed the old ways, especially when it came to the prayers. Only Malikh Family amongst the three that eager to embrace the new world that was coming. And by Elder Jhamil’s direction, instead of local shamans, Malikh Family asked help from foreign priests from western orthodox temples from nearby villages to lead the prayer.</p>\n<p>It was all good if one made a progressive decision with the greater good in mind. But here was the problem; orthodox temple priests usually led prayers for abundant harvest, while Ngajen Ceremony was all about calming Selaqs from descending the mountain. These priests probably hadn’t any clue how Selaqs looked like.</p>\n<p>“It was inappropriate for a noble to pray to old Mossack deities they don’t believe in, that was Malikhs’ excuses,'' Mila complained non-stop since they finished praying with other guests. In her hands--like a young mother hugging her baby--were plates of food she had just plundered from Malikh Family’s banquet tables prepared to entertain guests.</p>\n<p>“What deity? Wasn’t the mantra replaced from ancient Mossack prayers to magic spell mantra to calm down Selaq since… I don’t know, fifty years ago?” Romana said. The food in her hands was no less than Mila’s. These two girls seemed to think Malikh Family would regret offending them if they plunder the latter’s prepared feast like no tomorrow.</p>\n<p>“That's what I was saying! We no longer those ancient Mossacks who would sacrifice relatives so Selaqs won’t come down the mountain! Nowadays we’ve been using legit spells to keep all those Selaqs away, and these stupid Malikhs want to change the tradition just to appease some visiting noble? They’d rather avoid their noble guest to be uncomfortable than preventing Selaqs from coming down to chew their stupid brains, hah!”</p>\n<p>Compared to noisy girls beside him, Shira was able to keep his head to his feet. Romana signaled Mila with her eyes when she realized the boy wasn’t so into retaliating against the Malikhs; instead of invading the feast Shira, grabbed Malikh Family’s snacks moderately whenever he could--just like any other normal guests that came here.</p>\n<p>Mila grumbled with a bad mood, faced Shira and said, “Don’t you have something you need to do?”</p>\n<p>“Like what?” Shira hoped this cheeky cousin of his wouldn’t say something about kicking people’s asses again.</p>\n<p>“We can’t wait for something to happen,” she said. “Go ask that bitc--I mean, that fiancée of yours--go ask for a dance. The young’uns are starting to get heated. Look there, one of them couples are dancing. You go join them since that short-haired cunt is your fiancée after all.”</p>\n<p>Mila glanced around for a while before she realized she just had her tongue slipped. She quickly corrected her previous words, “Did I say cunt? I mean short-haired bitch--no, short-haired <em>young lady</em>.”</p>\n<p>“Why don’t you just be honest with yourself here. People have been calling Malikhs much worse here because the foreign priests matter!” Romana laughed.</p>\n<p>At that moment a very young maidservant of Malikh Family just passed by and overheard their conversation. The little maidservant snorted in anger, which made Mila snorted back as a retort.</p>\n<p>“Go, go! Go dance with her!” Mila whispered when she was sure only Shira and Romana were around.</p>\n<p>Shira clicked his tongue. “I don’t even have a single proper conversation with her these past ten years. Why should I go ask her dance out of the blue? Just showing our face around here is enough.”</p>\n<p>“Fool! If she accepted to dance with you then all is good, that would only confirm Malikh Family’s cocky attitude is only because their dipshit brains are getting fried by their own inflated proud ego, nothing serious! But if she ignores you in front of others… heh--she dares!”</p>\n<p>“That’s easy for you to say. If someone you don’t like suddenly asks your hands for a dance, what would you feel later on when you found out refusing means two families become enemies?”</p>\n<p>“Uh-uh, I don’t feel nothing. If he’s my fiancé then it’s my job to go my way out to make it clear in public! Going dancing, going kissing, like a proper damned couple! That’s what the goddamn engagement is all about! Right?”</p>\n<p>Mila ate a cookie and she blinked. Unsure of the previous words she said, she glanced at Romana and murmured, “...right?”</p>\n<p>Romana shrugged.</p>\n<p>But Shira wouldn’t back down easily. He continued arguing, “What if your fiancé is Bony Elzhier, then? Are you going to kiss him to prove he’s your fiancé?”</p>\n<p>Mila hid her gasp.</p>\n<p>“You wanna die?” she pursed her lips. “Listen to me or I’m gonna smack your face!”</p>\n<p>Shira groaned against his cousin’s unreasonableness. But before he could concoct a satisfying retort, Snake and Monkey came out of nowhere.</p>\n<p>“Oh, Young Master Shira,” Monkey came patting him on the shoulder, “it seems you get cuckolded for real this time.”</p>\n<p>People were clapping and whistling as the flashy Young Master Frane Blackwood led Young Lady Bhela Malikh by the hand.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Malikh was entertaining two guests previously, but that bald elder raised a fuss about how she neglected the young noble, so in the end it came to this.”</p>\n<p>Monkey laughed as he teased Shira with his elbow, “They’re going to dance. When two people were dancing in Ngajen Ceremony, that meant they--” he caught the scary experssion on Mila’s face, stopped, “nevermind…”</p>\n<p>“That slut!” Mila hissed.</p>\n<p>This was getting serious. Whenever Mila showed that kind of face something bad would happen. Again, the moment Shira opened his mouth to say something, someone else came to grab him in the shoulder.</p>\n<p>“Brat, your woman is going to cuckold you in public,” said the newcomer, Good-Natured Spirit, who literally came out of the thin air.</p>\n<p>“You too?”</p>\n<p>Shira had a headache. Both Monkey and Snake couldn’t see the annoying Good-Natured Spirit, but the three of them were in harmony in mocking him. They mocked him to the point saying he wouldn’t care would only embarrass him further.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, being led by the hand, Bhela Malikh asked Young Master Blackwood, “What kind of remedy Blackwood Family brought with you?”</p>\n<p>“Why so much in hurry, my young lady?” the young noble gave a laugh and a flash of smile. “No need to worry, Blackwood Family sympathize with the disaster that befell your father, so my mother send me here to personally deliver the medicine Blackwood House had sought far and wide.”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh said nothing more. The Young Master of Blackwood Family pondered as he read the cold expression of the girl, thinking that even with flowers and jewelry gifts, nothing could move this young lady. Such a waste of that beautiful face to not letting a single smile escaped, Young Master Blackwood could only smacked his lips and shook his head. But as soon as he mentioned a medicine he brought for her father, the feisty young lady became amiable almost immediately.</p>\n<p>Good thing for him. Bhela Malikh was talented, the Blackwood Family planned to have her inside their house, and if things went this smoothly he could do that his mother told him sooner than he expected.</p>\n<p>“Little bitch of Malikh Family,” a girl roared, “you finally show your true color you bitch! Is Yashura Family a joke to you?!”</p>\n<p>The furious Mila Yashura became the center of attention. She snorted as she strode, like an angry bull preparing to charge, with the mood that would make the crowd wordlessly give way to her. Not only because they didn’t want anything to do with the infamous young lady of Yashura Family--who, when angry, once punched Bony in the face with a nosebleed--but also because she got a sword in her hands.</p>\n<p>Shira glanced down. His father’s sword he brought with him was gone. He looked again at the unsheated weapon in his cousin’s hands.</p>\n<p>He could only slap his own face the moment he noticed what was happened.</p>\n<p>Mila took a step forward slowly, but her face turned even fiercer. She spoke, “You got guts to bring a lover from outside, eh? I knew something fishy happened when I saw you cut your hair, you little slut.”</p>\n<p>“I cut my hair because it got in the way during my training,” Bhela replied plainly. “And this is not my lover. Just a relative of my friend.”</p>\n<p>“You lying little slut. As if someone like you have any friends!”</p>\n<p>“I do have a friend.” Bhela said. A rare emphasizing tone in her voice was telling that she was upset, but she held back from explaining further.</p>\n<p>“I don’t care what your excuse is! Do you think I don’t know what you shitty Malikhs up to? You already don’t put Yashura Family in your eyes, eh? Just because you bitch have a little vacation outside, eh? If you think you’re a big shot, why don’t you prove it here and now?!”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh was silent for a while. Looking at Mila, she then asked, “And what are you suggesting I should do, Young Lady Yashura?”</p>\n<p>Mila stabbed her sword into the ground.</p>\n<p>“I just want to know how awesome is this Archer class you’ve got overseas that makes you Malikhs stop putting us Yashuras in your eyes,” Mila sneered. “Why don’t we test it with my sword, eh? Let’s do a duel, bitch.”</p>\n<p>Bhela just looked at Mila strangely.</p>\n<p>“But you’re a Specialist class,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Aha! Getting scared, aren’t ya, you little cunt?”</p>\n<p>Bhela didn’t want to argue with her. So she told the nearest servant to go grab a bow.</p>\n<p>On the other side, Monkey anxiously elbowed Shira, said, “Should I drag your cousin back?”</p>\n<p>“Stand down, mister. Mila is the one who’s starting it. She can’t afford to back down now.”</p>\n<p>Beside them Snake was nodding as he understood what Shira meant.</p>\n<p>Then with a laugh, Good-Natured Spirit, who was already tired jeering him, said to Shira. “Kid, shit just got real. Ain’t that a good idea to pull her before it’s too late?”</p>\n<p>Shira wanted to but he couldn’t. He knew exactly Mila’s strength. Fighting bare hands, she might get a chance to stand against the strongest youngster in the village, but it would become a different story when weapons and mana were involved.</p>\n<p>Since Mila was the one to propose the duel, bailing out before the fight began would be slapping her own face in front of the guests. It was a bad idea, because Mila didn’t appear to have the slightest chance to win. So bad that it’d be more reasonable to just surrender. But Shira knew Mila hated to go back on her words the most. Thus he silently moved closer to her, prepared to pull her back in before the situation really got out of his hands.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Young Master Blackwood, was pulled out by an adjutant of his family.</p>\n<p>Smirking, he asked the adjutant, “Who is that girl who picking a fight with Bhela?”</p>\n<p>“Seems like the eldest young lady of that family,” the adjutant replied.</p>\n<p>“You mean the family my Bhela got engaged to?” Young Master Frane Blackwood asked as if Bhela already his. The corner of his lips curled as he thought this might be a good chance to do something on the engagement that Blackwood House already saw as a thorn in their eyes. “Do you have something on that girl?”</p>\n<p>“Replying to young master, since Yashura Family is the main obstacle for us to get Young Lady Bhela Malikh to our side, your mother has already sent someone to investigate them. The eldest young lady of Yashura Family merely a Level 10 Specialist class who just graduated from Novice about seven months ago.”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood couldn’t help but chuckle. Even though the two young ladies had the same level, a Specialist merely support class that wasn’t suited in combat. This duel affair would turn out to be a joke.</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood scoffed. “Let my Bhela teach her some manners. I don’t want anyone to disturb us after this.”</p>\n<p>“Young master,” the adjutant lowered his voice, “I don’t think that’s a good idea.”</p>\n<p>“What’s on your mind, adjutant?”</p>\n<p>“I just made a round to check the guests attending this ceremony, and I found…”--he lowered his voice--“...some spectators amongst the guests that shouldn’t have be here….”</p>\n<p>“Go on,” the young noble urged.</p>\n<p>“I just received the word, young master, there are experts that Elder Jhamil said he didn’t invite.”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood frowned. “What… what’s that supposed to mean?”</p>\n<p>On the less crowded place of the courtyard, the middle-aged man who Bhela greeted before, along with the middle-aged woman, watched the commotion unfold while nibbling on steamed peanuts. He glanced at the other place where a man calmly sipping tea, a man with a hard face who couldn’t hide his sharp aura, then swept his gaze at the one who beside him, a short stature man who wore a headband to hide his reddish hair from public, who also happened to enjoy steamed peanuts while his focus solely at one direction in the crowd.</p>\n<p>All of them came in common garments incognito. But still Elder Jhamil sent people to keep tabs on them, especially since the bald elder still didn’t know the reason Bhela Malikh invited these foreigners.</p>\n<p>The ngajen ceremony usually consisted of three main parts--prayer, socializing, and sending offerings to the mountain as the finale. It was uncommon for irrelevant events to happen between them. However, since the young lady of the host had already accepted the duel, Malikh Family set up an emergency venue for the fight.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil came to invite himself as the judge. For a change to hummiliate those simple Yashuras and to slip himself onto the spotlight, he couldn’t ask for better opportunity.</p>\n<p>“You two ready?” Elder Jhamil asked both of the opposing sides. “This is a friendly match between two friendly families. So stop before your blade hit your enemy,” he said, seemingly talking to either sides, but didn’t say anything about the arrows part.</p>\n<p>Since Bhela Malikh was an Archer, she suggested to Mila, “I’m using a bow. So you can move first. I’ll try to dodge for ten seconds.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t need that,” Mila scoffed.</p>\n<p>“Very well…” she said. She glanced at Elder Jhamil, said, “Elder Jhamil, please begin the duel.&quot;</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil counted to three.</p>\n<p>The duel began.</p>\n<p>“AAAAAA!!!” Mila roared with the sword raised above her head, charging ahead.</p>\n<p>Contrast to her opponent’s battle cry, Bhela was solemn. She picked four arrows from the quiver tied on her hips. Nocking the arrows simultaneously, she took a deep breath as she concentrated to channel different natures elemental mana from her manasphere. The mana, through fingers and her thumb, flowing into all the four arrows and soon the tip of the arrows glowed with four different colors.</p>\n<p>The wind began to stir.</p>\n<p>And she raised the bow. She released the arrows.</p>\n<p><em>Fuuush fuuuushhh fuuushh shhuuuuusshh!</em></p>\n<p>Before even everyone noticed what happened, the mana Bhela channeled melted the flying arrows, within a span of milliseconds, turning them into dangerous magic projectiles of four elemental natures--fire, water, wind and lightning.</p>\n<p>Mila was confident before. She knew a trick against an Archer, but here she was dumbfounded by magic arrows coming to blast her way. She thought she was fighting an Archer, but got up against a Mage instead. This wasn’t what she signed up for.</p>\n<p><em>Clank!</em></p>\n<p>The first blue arrow dissapeared almost the moment it reached Mila. The sound of metallic clash that followed the said arrow resounded three more times, and the three arrows left behind too disappeared almost immediately. Mila, thought she ought to dodge the magic arrows, leap a step backward, but her hasty movement combined with the slippery mud made her slipped her foothold, accidentally fell to her butt instead.</p>\n<p>Bhela aimed down her bow. Everyone was staring at her with complicated and questioning gaze, as an Archer who could do magic, this was the first time everyone witnessed it.</p>\n<p>“It’s a four elemental affinity spell!” someone’s voice roared through the silenced venue, “I heard it, I doubted it, but she really did it!”</p>\n<p>Everyone looked at his way, the man who shouted, and saw that it was the middle-aged man whom Bhela invited from outside the village. He sat eating steamed peanuts then, now he was standing perplexed.</p>\n<p>Bhela, realizing that the man was the center of the attention, and bow to him from afar.</p>\n<p>“She really did it…” the man said under his breath.</p>\n<p>Someone who sat beside him said, “Sure she did, the only one right now--I guess now that you big brain from Elemental Stone School witnessed it I guess you can die without regret?”</p>\n<p>The man looked at the woman who accompanied him, he said still with expression of disbelieve, “It’s a four elemental affinity spell…”</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, you already said that.”</p>\n<p>The last and the most famous multi elemental Unique Class was, a mage with three elemental affinity skills, died of old age--was actually the headmaster of Elemental Stone School from seventy years ago. As a scholar and a mage researching deeply in topics of elemental mana all of his career, how could he didn’t know the value of a Unique Class who surpassed even the ex-headmaster of his school?</p>\n<p>“I can’t believe someone without a Mage Unique Class really did it…”</p>\n<p>“The most promising talent of this generation, alright, the first time I witnessed an Archer could do magic,” the woman said. “Good thing she stopped her arrows then--if not, the other girl would ended up so pitiful.”</p>\n<p>As the woman said that, someone else blurted not far away from there.</p>\n<p>“She didn’t stop it.”</p>\n<p>“Pardon? Sir Kurusiya?” the woman asked.</p>\n<p>The one she was talking to was the quiet man with sharp aura. He said as a matter of fact like tone, “She didn’t stop it. Someone else did,” he sipped his tea, and when the woman still confused, he explained with hoarse voice, “those are magic, but they were still arrows shot from a bow. You can’t stop flying arrows. That girl calculated and slightly missed her aim as to not hurting her opponent. But she didn’t plan to stop it.”</p>\n<p>The woman questioned him, “If she wasn’t the one who stopped it, then would you know why the arrows disappears?”</p>\n<p>The man put down his glass of tea. “I don’t know. Why you ask me? Ask that fool there who’s been grinning all the time.”</p>\n<p>The woman, along with the middle-aged man from Stone Elemental School, looked up to the bearded foreigner.</p>\n<p>“She’s not the one who stopped it,” the bearded man said with a smile.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Mila, who mellowed from her defeat and still sat on the muddy ground, gulped as she saw her cousin come to pick her up.</p>\n<p>“I lost,” she said to Shira.</p>\n<p>“No you didn’t, that girl is the one who put down her bow first, and you still got your swords in your hands--so technically you’d win.”</p>\n<p>“I fell to my butt, I was humiliated,” Mila said, her voice trembled, “I lost….”</p>\n<p>Shira sighed. He grabbed Mila’s hand and pulled her up. “It’s adult problems from hereon, Uncle Shuro would likely summon my father back. For now, let’s get out of here,” he said.</p>\n<p>Monkey and Snake, along with the nervous Romana, came to follow them from behind to shield them from people’s laughter. Mila was so humiliated the usually feisty tomboy was so down she couldn’t afford to hold her head straight. As Shira witnessed how pitiful his cousin was, regret overwhelming him when he remembered how he was holding back from taking action himself.</p>\n<p>“Brat,” someone called him.</p>\n<p>Shira turned his head. It was Good-Natured Spirit.</p>\n<p>“You owe me this time,” the Nalaq said.</p>\n<p>Shira nodded.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>“Hear ye hear ye people! Gather around and hear me announce something incredible, people! Gather around, will ya!”</p>\n<p>Standing on top of a table, Elder Jhamil shouted to gather people, announcing something that the Young Master of Blackwood Family passed him beforehands. “Although winner of the duel is Young Lady Bhela, Young Master Frane of Blackwood House is concerned by some stupid unruly girl of the supposed biggest family in Badril Village behavior would smear my young lady--”</p>\n<p>“Big news! Big news!” someone else’s shouting cut off Elder Jhamil’s announcement, “Young Master Bonithon is running around beating people! Watch your mouth if you don’t want get beaten for no reason!”</p>\n<p>“Bony is going crazy! He’s going to kick people’s asses! Nobody knows why!”</p>\n<p>“What the fuck is going on! Why Elzhier Family messing with us Malikhs now?”</p>\n<p>At the chaotic scene before him, Elder Jhamil’s face showed a frown and a hint of hesitation. He then cleared his phlegm anyway, trying to get people’s attention, then pushed on announcing carefully, “Young Master Frane Blackwood is concerned that--”</p>\n<p>“Elder Jhamil!!” a servant came running with a horrified expression, “Bony is coming for you, run away!”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil pointed his finger at the servant and roared, “What is that brat from Elzhier Family wants to do with me! Go kick him out, I’m trying to tell everybody something important here!”</p>\n<p>“But he doesn’t listen to reasons! He’s going to punch your face, is what he said just now!”</p>\n<p>“Imbecile! Do you think a young master would jump around like a monkey and punch an elder of another family in the damn face?! He’s making ruckus. Go on, kick him out!”</p>\n<p>Looking at the crowd from the rushedly made stage, he then smiled and continued, “Right, everybody, it’s Young Master of Blackwood Family; what I’m saying is that since Young Lady Bhela Malikh is winning with ease against the foolish young lady of <em>that</em> family, Young Master Blackwood concerned that some people would shrug my young lady’s victory. So he proposed, in order to make it clear the disparity between Malikh and--sheesh--Yashura, he proposed that him as a friendly representative of Malikh Family and Shira Yashura as the repre--”</p>\n<p>“Elder Jhamil--watch out!”</p>\n<p>He had it taking from lowly servants who cut off his announcement. Fuming in anger, Elder Jhamil pointed his finger toward the one who was spriting toward him and roared, “How many times I told you to just kick him out! Shut your trap and go kick the damned brat!”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was losing his cool. But what he failed to realize in time was that the one who sprinted toward him wasn’t a servant from his family. It was not the one who telling him to run away. And before he knew it, someone leaped up on the table where he was standing and delivered a punch to the face.</p>\n<p>“Gaaahhh!”</p>\n<p>Even after Elder Jhamil stumbled down the table he stood on, his assaulter didn’t plan to let him go. And what came after that was a torrent of hardened fist, pummeling his face even though he screamed for mercy. Only when the chaotic crowd succeeded in saving him did Elder Jhamil see the assaulter’s face--it was indeed the Young Master from Elzhier Family.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Bonithon… what did you… why did you do this… for what reason?!” Elder Jhamil choked out his grievance.</p>\n<p>Bony, the man who beat the bald elder black and blue, replied with nothing but a cold stare. Instead, it was an almost incoherent voice of Pilek who answered instead.</p>\n<p>“Kekekek, don’t be angry Elder Baldy! We just discussed how you were a splendid Pugilist a long time ago, so Boss Bony came here to find out whether it was true or not! That’s why he asked you to a barehand duel!” Pilek came in with a swagger and a bottle of booze in his hand. From a single glance anybody could tell he was drunk.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s lips trembled. What duel? That brat just leaped out of nowhere without saying anything, then immediately beating him black and blue!</p>\n<p>The only one from the three delinquents who hadn’t had the smell of liquor from his body was Polio. He wore an apologetic smile, and with a slight sigh, he said, “Please forgive them, dear kind Malikh sirs, my friends are terrible when they are drunk.”</p>\n<p>Polio made a round to apologize to any Malikhs he saw. But the Malikh Family didn’t appreciate his gesture, receiving jeerings in return.</p>\n<p>Polio was a patient young man, but Pilek wasn’t. The drunk Pilek didn’t take their attitude kindly, randomly walking to a servant, said, “Hah? What the fuck are you staring me at, you no-name Malikh servant? Wanna die, eh? Huuuraah!!!”</p>\n<p><em>Shatter!</em></p>\n<p>Without a warning he swung the booze in his hand to a Malikh family servant. The man he attacked stumbled backward holding his bloodied head from the crash Pilek gave him.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Bhela Malikh had just settled greeting four foreign guests that she invited from outside, and was on her way to fetch cuisines from the kitchen to humor her guests, then she witnessed the chaotic brawl unfold with a crowdful of cheers and jeers mixed in between. Perhaps there were more than a dozen men involved, with the Malikhs servants, guards, common family members even an elder came along to surround Bony and his two underlings.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela…” a little maidservant with a crest of Elzhier Family in her uniform bowed to Bhela politely.</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at her. She returned the bow even though the other party clearly was a servant. “Miss Elzhier,” she spoke softly.</p>\n<p>“No need to be polite to this servant, Young Lady.”</p>\n<p>“I can’t be impolite to Sister Ryntia’s friends.”</p>\n<p>The Elzhier Family maidservant smiled. Since Bhela insisted, then she wouldn’t be bowing her head anymore.</p>\n<p>She said, “Eldest Young Lady sends me to ask for your forgiveness for her brother’s brashness, Young Lady Bhela.”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at the brawl that started in her family’s courtyard. This chaos would spell imperfect on tonight's Malikh Family’s Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>“There’s no need for that. Since I accepted Young Lady Mila Yashura’s duel then I somewhat anticipated Young Master Bonithon will follow suit to make trouble tonight. If anything, it is I the one who should apologize to Sister Ryntia because I couldn’t handle the situation well. Please tell her that I’ll try to maintain friendship between Malikh and Elzhier Family.”</p>\n<p>Still with the serene smile on her face, the Elzhier Family maidservant studied the expression on Bhela’s face. She spoke a moment after, “Then I’ll let Eldest Young Lady Elzhier knows by tomorrow.”</p>\n<p>“Thanks,” Bhela offered her gratitude with a bow.</p>\n<p>By this time, the brawl became anything but intensified, as men either from Elzhier Family or thugs that previously had dealings with Bony’s group came in to reinforce the Elzhier young master. Before the Malikhs could pressure the intruders with numbers, but then the completely overwhelmed by the new reinforcement.</p>\n<p>“Huurraaahh!” Pilek sent a Malikh man flying with his kick. “Where the fuck your previous cocky taunt? Cat got your tongue, eh?”</p>\n<p>The only unspoken rules in brawls were strictly no usage of mana and spell as well as no sharp objects to use as weapons. But when it was chaotic and nobody could watch everybody the sharpest mind with tricks the one who prevailed--this is why the likes of Pilek and his friend Polio who always struck in place people wouldn’t be willing the one who were taking the advantage in brawls. Even hunters and seasoned guards were no match against these naughty brats.</p>\n<p>For example, when Pilek’s punch was blocked by Elder Jhamil’s son, “You shitty brat, just wait till I deal with your father--kuukgghh!”</p>\n<p>And because no one was watching, Pilek used his knee to strike the cocky young elder in the balls.</p>\n<p>With a sad whimper from his trembling lips, Elder Jhamil’s son curled onto the ground holding his precious balls that Polio struck.</p>\n<p>Seeing that a family elder was mercilessly defeated, a few Malikhs came to avenge their young elder. By then, Pilek already had Polio watching over his back.</p>\n<p>At that point, no Malikhs could match them in hand-in-hand brawl.</p>\n<p>A stranger then casually walked in. Pilek stopped, looking at him, and amidst the chaotic scene it took a while for him to find out that the man was actually a foreigner--an eastern Kaya man. The man had a sheathed sword on his hips. But Pilek wasn’t afraid as long as he stick with the brawl rules to use only fighting unarmed.</p>\n<p>“Huurraaah!”</p>\n<p>Pilek threw a feint. Most simple Malikhs would fall for this. But the eastern Kaya man didn’t budge. Seemed to even anticipate it. With a movement too fast for Pilek to follow the man grabbed his wrist, flicked him and sent him into the air like it was nothing.</p>\n<p>It was only after Pilek rolled in the mud he realized what had happened.</p>\n<p>The man then glanced aside and walked toward Polio who in his own right was too engrossed with the brawl. With his left hand pushing Polio’s shoulder and the other hand grabbing his wrist, he flipped Polio just like he did Pilek beforehand.</p>\n<p>Pilek and a few others that the man previously flipped were amazed by how effortlessly the man disabling enthusiastic young men from fighting.</p>\n<p>The sword handle the man had was wrapped with cloth and its body too thin for regular blades. Those who noticed this would understand that the man wasn’t an ordinary Kaya. Polio was one of them.</p>\n<p>“A Samurai!” he exclaimed a moment after he got thrown onto the muddy ground.</p>\n<p>The Kaya man stopped, looking at him, then spoke with a displeased tone, “I am but a masterless ronin.”</p>\n<p>The man then continued walking toward a different direction.</p>\n<p>Bony was fighting with three men alone, so he couldn’t afford to look around. He didn’t realize the Kaya man at first, but when the man tried to grab the wild young master’s wrist, Bony reacted--he reacted by throwing a punch to the man’s face.</p>\n<p>The man slapped his flying fist from the side, tremendously muffled its momentum. Again, he tried to grab Bony’s wrist and his shoulder. Bony tried resisting but the man’s speed was too fast for him to compete.</p>\n<p>As the man prepared to flip him, Bony felt a faint gush of the wind from his legs. It didn’t take him a second to realize the man just putting his hand on his shoulder as a feint--his real target was to gently nudge his foot on rooting from the ground, which, if he’d focus his effort to get his shoulder free from the man’s grasp, a small window of opening that could be used by his opponent to disrupt his sense of balance. Thus Bony firmly stomped his feet to the ground instead. He grabbed the man’s sleeve to make his opponent not be able to easily throw like Pilek and Polio.</p>\n<p>Responding to Bony’s choice, the man curled the corner of his lips. Bony caught a hint of taunt when he staring the man in the eyes.</p>\n<p>“Kkuuuggghh!”</p>\n<p>Bony did succeed in preventing himself get flipped to the ground. But he got struck in the gut instead.</p>\n<p>The man didn’t let him go. The moment Bony stepping backward due to shock having stricken, the man was charging and got his wrist in the blink of the eyes--what happened afterward was Bony got his feet swept and he completely lost his ground, and got cheered by his friends as the last man who got thrown into the mud.</p>\n<p>Bony then sat there looking as the fight stopped; since someone took him down, more and less the Malikhs had won the brawl.</p>\n<p>“Aren’t you Thoqek’s son?” the Kaya man asked Bony.</p>\n<p>Bony wasn’t willing to open his mouth when his father’s name got mentioned.</p>\n<p>Receiving no answer, the man thus carelessly said, “Unexpectedly, you’ve got more guts than your father. Get up now, and stop making trouble in Ghalim Malikh’s home.”</p>\n<p>The young ruffians with Bony as the leader naturally wouldn’t be arrogant anymore since they had been defeated. They retreated calmly, and the Malikhs didn’t dare taunt them the second time in case Bony would change his mind and started on a rampage again. In the end, the real reason why Bony came targeting Malikh Family, as many people knew, was that he wasn’t a drinker that would lose reason to punch another family’s elder in the face.</p>\n<p>Speaking about an elder who got a punch in the face; after Bony and others were gone, Elder Jhamil showed his nose out of his hiding place. He gritted his teeth. He swore he’d use his full resource to get back from Bony’s father in the next village council meeting.</p>\n<p>“Elder Jhamil, you still haven’t announced the thing I ask you to do,” from behind, the sullen young noble Frane Blackwood said to him.</p>\n<p>“Y-young Master Blackwood, please spare me--the mood isn’t that good to draw people’s attention after that kid crashing our Ngajen Ceremony just now. How about I brief it to other village leaders tomorrow in the village council meeting?”</p>\n<p>“No, I want everyone to know it by tonight. This is the right time and the right place to announce it. Besides, I want to see what kind of a young man the one who’s supposed to be my rival.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil didn’t want to show his beaten face to the crowd tonight. But as much as he love his face he knew flattery wouldn’t get him out of this situation--at least not if he didn’t want to offend the young noble. And so with a heavy face he climbed the table once again, hiding off his reluctancy.</p>\n<p>Someone heartily made a joke on him, “Elder Jhamil, we thought you’re a man who care about face the most--I don’t expect you to boldly show how handsome you’ve become now!”</p>\n<p>“Kids nowadays getting big headed by their privileges as young masters--naturally I’ll let their fathers know how to discipline their brats!” Elder Jhamil coldly said. “Anyway, you all know that my Young Lady Bhela is a girl with talent and her future is boundless. Here in Malikh Family we’re not willing to throw our princess to cow’s dunk that is Yashura Family’s trash young master. And our friend Young Noble Frane Blackwood also thinks the same!”</p>\n<p>Such passionate speech, naturally people were cheering in anticipation of the next spectacle they thought they were going to witness.</p>\n<p>Getting the cue from Elder Jhamil, Frane Blackwood came forward with a swagger. “I speak this as a close friend of Young Lady Bhela Malikh. Someone with the name of Shira Yashura; if you think you’re worthy of her, do you dare to prove it by having a duel with me?!”</p>\n<p>The crowd was silent. They were waiting for the reply.</p>\n<p>Frane Blackwood swept the crowd with his eyes.</p>\n<p>Someone said to him the boy he challenged was utter trash. He was amused guessing how this trash would respond to his duel challenge, especially when Bhela Malikh had just completely defeated the cheeky young lady from his family.</p>\n<p>There were already murmurs spreading. People were also curious whether Shira was going to accept or run away from it.</p>\n<p>And then…</p>\n<p>“<em>Cough, cough…</em>” someone awkwardly stepped forward with a wry smile plastered on his face. People recognized his face, which looked like a monkey, and many of them had seen him together with Shira Yashura.</p>\n<p>He was Monkey. He said, “This young noble… about your proposed duel… I’m afraid Young Master Shira Yashura can’t answer it tonight.”</p>\n<p>Frane Blackwood laughed. “Why? He’s scared? His cousin challenged Young Lady Bhela to a duel for no apparent reason; don’t tell me we can do the same to them?”</p>\n<p>“No, it’s not that.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil pointed his finger at Monkey. “We all know Shira Yashura is a trash who can’t even advance to Level 4 Novice! Young Master Frane Blackwood is kind. Tonight, he’s going to give Shira one chance to admit that he’s unworthy of Young Lady Bhela Malikh to the crowd here. He does that, and there will be no need for Young Master Frane Blackwood to embarrass him by kicking his ass!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, but he can’t give you an answer tonight,” Monkey insisted.</p>\n<p>Now it was Elder Jhamil who laughed. “He’s really scared facing Young Master Frane right now?!”</p>\n<p>“No…”</p>\n<p>“Then why?”</p>\n<p>Monkey sighed.</p>\n<p>“Because he’s already gone home!”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was furious. The whole point he had to gather people even though his face had been beaten by Bony was to call out the boy and embarrass him in public, as per the young noble request. But the said person himself already went home, so Elder Jhamil standing on top of the table was for nothing.</p>\n<p>Immediately he ordered a servant to send the message to Yashura Family, while in between, cursing the fact that he didn’t get the chance to distract the guests from discussing the previous brawl. Sure enough, not only the people were talking about Bhela Malikh’s hidden Unique Class, they were also talking about Bony, and people he beat to pulp, especially Elder Jhamil. People no longer cared to gossip about Young Lady Mila Yashura who had been sent home defeated, but they laughed at someone present who had just his misfortune like Elder Jhamil instead.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil had lost his face in the end. Literally and metaphorically.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, with a solemn expression Monkey looked at his partner Snake who was enjoying the banquet and had amused himself watching the spectacle previously.</p>\n<p>Monkey said with a whisper, “Why the hell your family doesn’t show his face when they dumping shit to Young Master and Young Lady Yashura just now?!”</p>\n<p>Snake glanced at him lazily. “I don’t know. They said they were going to diagnose Patriarch Ghalim Malikh previously.”</p>\n<p>“Can’t you just fetch your brother instead? Didn’t you put your words to assure young master before this? What if he thinks we’re people who put our words lightly?”</p>\n<p>“The one who’s diagnosing the patriarch is my grandfather, my brother supposed to be free enough to be a busybody just now,” Snake said, displeased by Monkey’s tone accusing him of being unloyal to his own word.</p>\n<p>Actually, he also confused why his brother didn’t show his nose when Young Lady Mila recklessly brought a sword to challenge Bhela to a duel. From his understanding of his brother’s character and the relationship between his family and Yashura from what he knew told him that more or less his brother was going to back Yashura if the drama with Malikh Family intensified. But he didn’t. Snake would barge into Malikh Family’s doors to look for his grandfather if he knew it was going to be like this instead.</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-4/chapter-5-1":"<authors-note id=\"Radhy\" type=\"danger\">\n<p>I don’t recommend reading from here onwards because the chapter below is still from the previous draft, which is different from the previous 4 chapters. Further edits will be made that most likely makes this chapter quite different than the current one.</p>\n</authors-note>\n<p>In a certain hall in Malikh Family’s left wing complex, four people sat idly on the bamboo mats covered floor. They were being served local-specialty ginger drinks mixed with brown sugar with herbs to drink. There were also some roasted peanuts to chew. Despite they dressed humbly when attending the Ngajen Ceremony, three of them were elders with statuses, while one of them, the sword bearing Kaya man, wasn’t anyone to ignore either.</p>\n<p>Having knowing this, they still waiting for their host, Bhela Malikh, to wrap up the Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>“Still,” Madame Sylvia said after a sip of ginger drink, “I wouldn’t have expected the girl’s talent to be that rare when she approached my sect with the invitation. The top brass only interested of her being the top grade during the seminar thus sent me to check her out. How about you, Mister Harrington?”</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t expecting it either. I only interested when the report said she showed a potential of being two elemental-affinities Archer. Three already great, but with four elementals, chances she’ll get her name down in history books.”</p>\n<p>“That is what happen if she able to live long enough to develop her full potential,” the quiet man with sharp aura remarked. His face was thin, rough, and since he never liked to smile, he always looked like he meant business. The man was role model of eastern Kaya race ancient warriors--stand and sit in straight posture, humorless, and most importantly, always bringing the sharp, thin sword of katana on his hips.</p>\n<p>Madame Sylvia was interested on his remark. So she asked, “Oh, why you think of that, Sir Kurusiya?”</p>\n<p>The eastern man replied, “Because she tangled herself with Blackwood Family,” he paused. “If this Blackwood the same one from this Blackwood guy I know, then it’s definitely a bad news for her.”</p>\n<p>Mister Harrington from Elemental Stone School disagreed.</p>\n<p>“Since when our factions become soft?” he questioned. “We’re not that pitiful to handle some second-rate noble family. Honestly, I think that young man from that Blackwood Family such a pest. If Young Lady Bhela asks for my favor, I’ll handle him cleanly and thoroughly--right here, right now.”</p>\n<p>“I’m not talking about Blackwood Family, I’m talking about the creepy guy with Blackwood as his last name,” Sir Kurusiya said as he put down his ginger drink. He wasn’t happy, so Madame Sylvia signaled Mister Harrington that it best not to continue arguing with the scary eastern Kaya man.</p>\n<p>The hall suddenly turned quiet. Then, the fourth man was happily enjoyed his drink, out of the blue he blurted for his opinion that no one asked for. “That boy from Yashura Family is sure interesting…”</p>\n<p>Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia smiled wryly. Nobody said anything about Yashura Family up until now. The fourth man, Baront Staterwind, came from a very peculiar faction. Which actually had nothing to do with Bhela’s type of talent. Even when he had already came to Badril Village, none would think he accepted Bhela Malikh’s invitation just to scout her talent.</p>\n<p>The hall’s door was knocked. Bhela entered. She politely greeted the four respected guests before she sat down.</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry for the wait, dear elders. Malikh Family hasn’t prepared the best dishes for you during the ceremony, so I asked the best chef we have to cook special meals for you,” Bhela said, then she glanced at the door. “Please enter, aunty!”</p>\n<p>The moment she called, a middle-aged woman who helped Bhela in the kitchen before came with a line of maidservants, bringing freshly cooked dinner meals with them. It was better than what the Malikhs served for the guests before, even compared to the meals served for the family’s important guests cooked by Bhela as the chief chef.</p>\n<p>“I rather you serve me some alcohol,” the eastern Sir Kurusiya said to her.</p>\n<p>Bhela nodded at his request and asked the aunty to fetch the best alcohol she could find. Of course, the best person to get help was the elder who provided Bhela with the hall to host her guests. Bhela hoped the said elder already knew the importance of this meeting thus not being stingy with his alcohol collection.</p>\n<p>“Can we start now, young lady? I don’t have a good alcohol tolerance so I rather get this completed before us adults get to drink,” Madame Sylvia said.</p>\n<p>“We have delicious food here served, Madame Sylvia. To be honest, all the wait before is for the aunties preparing dinner for dear elders,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>But not of the adults believed her words easily.</p>\n<p>“Hoho, you seem so nervous, young lady. You might not look like it, but you seem about to cry,” Sir Baront Staterwind said.</p>\n<p>“Just state what you want from us, don’t waste anymore time,” Sir Kurusiya urged.</p>\n<p>Bhela lowered her head. With her lips tremblingly parted, she said, “As you might know, my father fell ill when I was overseas attending the seminar. My mother has contacted many doctors and alchemists to make medicines for him, yet my father’s condition never improved. I request for elders’ wisdom and strength, please help my poor father, he was in misery for months…”</p>\n<p>Bhela prostated.</p>\n<p>“Please, help me father… he’s dying… please…” she begged.</p>\n<p>Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia exchanged glances. The peculiar beardy man, Sir Baront, merely nodded without letting his thoughts known. Meanwhile, Sir Kurusiya, who didn’t bulge seeing the pretty girl begging in front of him, coldly said, “Well, this is really a waste of time.”</p>\n<p>Hearing the eastern man snorted, Bhela’s heart went cold. She prepared herself bowing down for help, without stating a single offer to prove how desperate herself.</p>\n<p>“And, young lady…” Madame Sylvia asked slowly, “what would you do if someone managed to heal your father?”</p>\n<p>Bhela rose up. She looked straight to Madam Sylvia’s gaze, then said, “Anything,”</p>\n<p>“Anything?”</p>\n<p>“Anything.”</p>\n<p>The room went quiet. Only Mister Harrington’s regretful sigh could be heard.</p>\n<p>It was Sir Baront Staterwind who explained with a good intention, “It really seems you haven’t grasped the situation you were in, young lady. The guest who gave you the gift from before, he’s a young master of a family known as the peerless medicine makers and doctors. If they couldn’t cure your father illness, then I believe no one in this room knows who really can.”</p>\n<p>“If I had a petty mind, young lady, I’d kill for the cosmetic you got from them. That’s how valuable their skills are,” Madam Sylvia said as she shook her head in pity.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh bit her lips. She was eloquent when she invited these experts months ago. Yet tonight, she had completely became tongue-tied and defeated. The cold air suddenly felt more unbearable. Although the warm meals’ delicious aroma wafted through the hall, not a single person had any incentive to touch their food. Everyone in the hall sunken into silence.</p>\n<p>“You want my advice, young lady?” the sharp voice of Sir Kurusiya sliced through the awkward atmosphere. He continued, “Having turned your back against Yashura Family is the dumbest decision you did. I didn’t come here because of you. I know your father, and I certainly know that swordsman from Yashura Family more. It’s a pity I couldn’t meet them today. Really, a complete waste miles and miles of journey.”</p>\n<p>With that, Sir Kurusiya, stood up and prepared to leave.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh quickly swallowed her bitterness, also stood up and said, “Please, Elder Kurusiya, let me see you the way out.”</p>\n<p>“No, don’t,” Sir Kurusiya flatly rejected her offer. “Sit down. These three fogies still haven’t decided what they want to do with you. Better think carefully about what you’re going to say to them next.”</p>\n<p>The eastern man saw himself out. Following his suggestion, Bhela Malikh sat down again and faced the three experts, with her mind suddenly became as blank as a barren field in the corner of abandoned land. She didn’t know what she ought to say to them, seeing the looks of pity they directed at her. Then, just when she managed to regain her bravery to say something, the door slammed open--</p>\n<p>“I come as the representative of Blackwood Family!” Young Master Frane Blackwood boldly yelled.</p>\n<p>He swagered himself in along with Elder Jhamil’s son and the adjutant of Blackwood Family under his wings. The arrogant behaviour of this young noble completely disregard the experts in the room. Madame Sylvia had enough. She dissed him, “What are you doing here uninvited?”</p>\n<p>Instead of the adjutant who usually spoke for his young master, it was the young elder of Malikh Family, Elder Jhamil’s son who replying. “This madam has eyes but doesn’t know what good for her. Of course Young Master Blackwood is invited! He’s the special guest of Malikh Family after all!”</p>\n<p>“What’s your name, boy?” the middle-aged woman hissed.</p>\n<p>“I’m Elder Jhamil’s eldest son! What’s up with you, you don’t have the right to know my name!”</p>\n<p>“Is that it? Very well. It seems just because I respect the southerner custom by dressing commonly you ignorant people already forgot what's best for you. Very well!”</p>\n<p><em>Zziiing!</em></p>\n<p>With a flashing draw of metallic sword, Madame Sylvia stood up to give this ignorant young elder a lesson. But her companion Mister Harrington quickly pulled her back before things really blown up.</p>\n<p>“You brought a weapon with you!” the Elder Jhamil’s son screamed with his finger pointing at Madame Sylvia who already trembling holding back her fury. “Do you not know what’s gonna happen to guests who bring weapons inside their host’s home?”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood rolled his eyes and told his adjutant, “Send this toad out of here, he’s too noisy!”</p>\n<p>“Right away,” the adjutant said. Then with his bony hands, he pulled the screaming Elder Jhamil’s son forcefully.</p>\n<p>“Is the discussion still ongoing?” Frane Blackwood asked the sitting guests as he tightened the blue necktie he wore. He said to Bhela, “Blackwood Family offers a lifetime terms of benefit for you, young lady. Not only medicines, if it boost potion you ask, or equipments, magic items, weapons--you name it, we have all things you’d dare to imagine!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho,” his uninvited offer gave Sir Baront Staterwind a chuckle. The three guests Bhela invited hailed from their own factions, so even if they wanted to rope Bhela in, they would consult with their higher ups about the specific terms they’d give to her as benefits. However, Blackwood Family was, in fact, only a noble family, not an organizational faction, with the only way in was through marriage--so of course the young noble would be able to offer a “lifetime benefits” to her so brazenly.</p>\n<p>“Thank you for holding back your anger, Madame Sylvia,” Bhela completely bowed her head to the angry guest while she completely disregarded Young Master Blackwood’s offers.</p>\n<p>Madame Sylvia nodded. She then looked at Young Master Blackwood and snorted. “Young lady, think carefully about what we said before. Some incapable people only able to spout honey trap to get what they want. Don’t be foolish because your father’s situation.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you for the advice…”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood wanted to argue with this lady. But he also held himself back as he didn’t know the other party’s identity. Therefore, all he could do was haughtily smiling elegantly as a proper noble as he was.</p>\n<p>“Has the discussion already started?” Frane Blackwood asked again. Pity him, not even one interested in answering. Because of that his face became red as he fumed with anger.</p>\n<p>“Ah,” Sir Baront Staterwind looked outside the window and slapped his thigh, “look how late it is! I planned to sleep early because I have something I need to do tomorrow early in the morning!”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh quickly offered to see him till the gate.</p>\n<p>“Hoho, how about you two?” Sir Baront asked the last two foreign experts, the pair of middle-aged man and woman, “overstaying your visit is considering a burden to these good Mossack folks, don’t you think so?”</p>\n<p>“I’m but an ignorant western lady, I know little about the way of the southern people, so please don’t mind us being shameless,” Madame Sylvia said. She then looked at Bhela, “Young Lady Bhela, Mister Harrington and I apparently haven’t booked our place in the village’s inns. We don’t know our talks would turned out dragged this late. For this I have to beg you to let us stay in Malikh Family for a few good days.”</p>\n<p>“Hoho…” Sir Baront Staterwind chuckled as he looked at the poker face pair of experts. Wasn’t the four of them--including Sir Kurusiya, checked in the same inn this afternoon? It was clear Madame Sylvia and Mister Harrington had their own intentions, thus Sir Baront Staterwind shrugged the idea of exposing their little white lies.</p>\n<p>And with that, Bhela Malikh led the three expert guests she invited out of the room. Young Master Blackwood, who was ignored so hard she almost exploded, yelling, “Young Lady Bhela!”</p>\n<p>Bhela turned around. “Yes, Young Master Blackwood?”</p>\n<p>“How about me?”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh blinked. Then she picked a bowl of roasted peanuts and approached him, saying softly, “Please sit down and enjoy this snack. I need to attend to my guests.”</p>\n<p>Hearing her soft, yet slightly cold voice, Young Lady Blackwood the understood something that made him excited, so excited he obediently sat down and nimbled on the roasted peanuts the beautiful Young Lady Bhela gave him.</p>\n<p>Then after Bhela brought the guests out, the Blackwood Family adjutant who was waiting outside came in inside the hall.</p>\n<p>“What are you doing?!” Young Master Blackwood hissed.</p>\n<p>The adjutant gawked. “Young master, I’m here to serve you…”</p>\n<p>“Serve me?” the young master cringed. What a joke! Soon he’d have a time being alone with Young Lady Bhela, and this old man wanted to be here right when he had the chance of his lifetime? What if there--during the discussion--was an accident where he had to be responsible as a man? Would he be happy if the adjutant was here when that happened?</p>\n<p>Absolutely not!</p>\n<p>“Get out! Don’t dawdle around here tonight! I need to discuss an important manner with Young Lady Bhela secretly!”</p>\n<p>“Y-young master--”</p>\n<p>“What are you waiting for! Go back to the inn and don’t bother me till the next morning!”</p>\n<p>The adjutant naturally understood what was inside the young master’s mind. He didn’t dare to linger around. With careful steps, he closed the door and went back to the inn Blackwood Family checked in.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Young Master Blackwood was so excited he couldn’t sit calmly alone in the hall. The thought of having private discussion with a girl as pretty as Bhela Malikh made him thinking a lot of things. Slowly, he getting horny.</p>\n<p>“What is taking her so long?” he mumbled to himself after waiting a fruitless thirty minutes. “Is it maybe she needs to… prepare, herself?”</p>\n<p>If it was going to be her first time, of course she needed time to prepare herself, Young Master Blackwood thought. This young noble had “befriend” and participating in “private discussions” with many experienced women. But virgin girls, he never tasted any.</p>\n<p>Because of that, he willing to wait however much longer for the young lady to prepare herself. And thus, after waiting for another thirty minutes, nothing happened. Nothing happened for the next hour as well. Then, after waiting for nearly three hours alone, the door finally opened…</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela, you finally ready!” Young Master Blackwood snapped out of his sleepy face and excitedly came to greet the visitor. Much to his disappointment, the visitor turned out to be the faithful adjutant.</p>\n<p>“Why is that you?!” Young Master Blackwood roared.</p>\n<p>“Y-young master… let’s get back to the inn,” the adjutant nervously asked.</p>\n<p>“Where’s Young Lady Bhela?”</p>\n<p>“She is in her room…”</p>\n<p>“Then you send someone there to ask her when she’s going to meet me,” the young noble ordered.</p>\n<p>“I’m afraid I can’t… young master…”</p>\n<p>“I’ve been waiting for hours, why?”</p>\n<p>The adjutant gulped before he replied.</p>\n<p>“Because the young lady has already gone sleeping since three hours ago!”</p>\n<p>So much for his dreamy private discussion! Young Master Blackwood was so angry for being misled that he slapped the adjutant’s face all the way back to his inn.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A single torch on a stick stubbornly lit the corner of the village in spite of the strong wind. A howling wolf in the distance reinforced the lone, cold sense of the midnight Badril Village. The only shop that still open at this hours could be counted with one hand, and this liquor shop was one of them. No customer visited it except a foreign eastern Kaya man.</p>\n<p>A series of step could be heard. The sleepy shopkeeper snapped back when he heard a new customer approaching.</p>\n<p>“Give me a glass of <em>tuak</em>, shopkeeper,” the new customer ordered with a booming voice. One could see his beardy feature when his face exposed to the shop’s lantern light. “Mind if I join you, Sir Kurusiya?”</p>\n<p>The eastern man didn’t reply. He drank his alcohol instead.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront Staterwind laughed by his cold treatment. The beardy guy was an easygoing person, so he casually grabbed a bowl of steamed peanuts and started to nibble on those snacks.</p>\n<p>“You’re not visiting Bhela’s father? You said you know him, you know, saying hi to a sick old buddy?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t say hi to a dying man,” Sir Kurusiya said.</p>\n<p>The answer made the air awkward. So Sir Baront quickly came with another topic.</p>\n<p>“It seems those two lovers adamant to protect the girl,” he said, referring to the other two experts who once were couple before Mister Harrington lost Madame Sylvia to another guy. “Or I think they just want some privacy to have some little reunion… who knows?”</p>\n<p>Sir Kurusiya never bothered with petty gossip, he callously replied, “They don’t know Malikh Family. They can’t protect her forever.”</p>\n<p>“Exactly,” Sir Baront Staterwind agreed. After that both men continued drinking without saying anything.</p>\n<p>“Hey shopkeeper,” Sir Baront called, “don’t you have anything with less alcohol? I have a business I’d like to deal with tomorrow, so I want to avoid shitty hangover.”</p>\n<p>“I have some sweet <em>tuak</em>,” the shopkeeper poured a new bottle into Sir Baront’s empty glass, “this one usually for them boys who haven’t gone coming of age ceremony. No alcohol, costs as little as four copper kobe coins.”</p>\n<p>“Four coppers, ah! Why’s that the souther I go the cheaper the drink?” he sipped it, “mm! Pretty good, my good man!”</p>\n<p>He tipped the shopkeeper with a silver coin. The shopkeeper was dumbfounded but quickly recovered and hid the coin safely.</p>\n<p>Sir Kurusiya said to Sir Baront, “You want to go to Yashura Family tomorrow?”</p>\n<p>“How did you know?”</p>\n<p>“Even though I can’t see him, I know the one who repelled Bhela’s arrow was a Nalaq,” Sir Kurusiya said.</p>\n<p>“Hoho, since I managed to rope in the young lady of Yurin Family, I’ve got promoted to an instructor,” Sir Baront smiled widely. “Doing the legwork isn’t my job anymore… but checking him and the boy won’t hurt, so I’m going. Hmm, I wonder if the Nalaq has already form his contract?”</p>\n<p>“Huuh…” the shopkeeper, who had been hearing their chatting, couldn’t help but asked, “you good sir, what’s this talking about a Nalaq having to do with Yashura Family?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, you’re a Yashura?” Sir Baront asked.</p>\n<p>“I’m Elzhier, from the outer family,” the shopkeeper said. “I’ve been in this village for forty years, but never I’ve heard any Nalaq passing by.”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, that’s why I’m going. Usually a rogue Nalaq isn’t someone tied with a faction, so they aren’t that big of deal--which also make them easier to rope in!”</p>\n<p>“Ooohh! Are you a Nalaq expert, mister? From overseas? Our family’s eldest young lady actually was scouted by a passing expert from overseas too, an expert from purple something sect!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, you mean Purple Garden Sect?” Sir Baront Staterwind and asked as he played along.</p>\n<p>But Sir Kurusiya was sceptic. “Purple Garden Sect is too far. And someone from that kind of superpower faction won’t be too idle to accidentally passing by on this kind of rural village.”</p>\n<p>Sir Baront nodded at Sir Kurusiya’s logic. Even if it was that particular sect that accepted the said young lady, both experts wouldn’t be too sure about whether she could be the sect’s legitimate disciple. Their doubts made the shopkeeper embarrassed. Since ten years ago, the tales of the eldest young lady of Elzhier Family being accepted by a foreign expert was a legend amongst Badril Village locals. Except her and the recent Malikh Family’s young lady, no one in the village was lucky got scouted to study oversea, so it became a fact that Elzhier Family was very proud of--and was one of the reasons why the Elzhier could win the village head’s seat from Yashura Family after their decades of leading Badril Village. But the problem was, in the letters their young lady sent home, she always talked about shops, fashions, and some other trivial stuffs that usually young women her age excited about. That made even her father, the current Elzhier Family’s patriarch and the Village Head, felt it was became difficult to still boasting the young lady’s status after ten years of her spending overseas.</p>\n<p>“But still, experts, you might not know this, but our eldest young lady was Young Lady of Malikh Family’s closest childhood friend! When Young Lady Bhela Malikh only a little girl our young lady gave her a lot of pointers and knowledge, so much that I assure that if it wasn’t for her being there for Young Lady Bhela, the Malikh Family wouldn’t get their talented Unique Class for at least the next one hundred years!”</p>\n<p>“Right…” Sir Baront became awkward instantly. To think some ignorant folks believed blessing of Unique Classes was that simple, even Sir Kurusiya scoffed at the idea.</p>\n<p>The shopkeeper’s face became red as he realized it was wise not to delay any longer. So he quickly said, “If you have some spare time, sir experts, I’m sure our Elzhier Family willing to entertain you!”</p>\n<p>After paying for their drinks, even the agreeable Sir Baront Staterwind felt it was very awkward for him to return to this little shop. Both decided not to get themselves involved with Elzhier Family after the shopkeeper’s little salesman talks, whilst not knowing the inn they stayed inn owned by Elzhier Family.</p>\n<p>On the way back, Sir Baront asked Sir Kurusiya for advice.</p>\n<p>“Yo, Kurusiya, I’m going to accept the Yashura boy as my third disciple if the Nalaq’s pretty good. But, you know, the Nalaq who contracted with youngest disciple is a master thirteen thousands years ago. She was a heavy weight figure, so I reckon I’ll let her calls the shot. What’s your opinion on this?”</p>\n<p>“How powerful is this Nalaq you’re talking about?”</p>\n<p>Sir Baront grinned. “You know the legend about Seven Pillars of Tiramikal Continent? She’s the Frost Mage mentioned in that history. Pretty neat, huh? She was able to revive as Nalaq and regained her consciousness five years ago. All the big shots in my Blue Robe Society can’t wait for the girl she’s contracted with to formally accepted into our faction.”</p>\n<p>“If that’s the case then your disciple isn’t necesserily worse than Malikh’s four elemental Archer girl.”</p>\n<p>“So you know why I can’t accept the boy if he’s too crude--I can’t afford to offend this madam Nalaq even the slightest bit.” he took out a bag of roasted peanuts he bought from the shopkeeper, and started to nibble on them. “I’m going to write a letter to my disciples, they’ve been playing around in the neighboring village. This madam Nalaq will come and check the boy herself.”</p>\n<p>Sir Kurusiya abruptly stopped his steps.</p>\n<p>“You want my advice?” he looked straight at Sir Baront’s eyes. “My advice is simple. You’re going to make this madam Nalaq of yours polite and you’re going to beg her to be mindful of her attitude in front of Yashura Family.”</p>\n<p>“You’re joking? You serious?”</p>\n<p>“I’m always serious,” Sir Kurusiya said.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Patriarch of Yashura Family, Shuro Yashura, was exhilarated to see Grandpa Piss and Snotty came to visit the village. One part because he treasured the friendships between their family and Grandpa Piss’s relatives, but mainly, he got to show-off his latest coconut cake recipe.</p>\n<p>“Ah, this is life, drinking <em>tuak</em> when we’re watching the moon, getting drunk while we’re eating coconuts. What a life!” Patriarch Shuro mumbled.</p>\n<p>“What a life indeed,” Grandpa Piss nodded with a low chuckle. On the sky, the full moon was shining bright really beautiful.</p>\n<p>After he’d done his part in ngajen ceremony, Patriarch Shuro Yashura accompanied the old Alchemist and his grandson in a spacious veranda, where they ate coconut cakes and drinking _tuak _while spending time moongazing. They had the Yashura Family’s sole butler, Yulong, to hold the _tuak _bottle and refilled their cups when empty.</p>\n<p>“Grandpa Piss, why didn’t you tell us beforehand before you visit Badril Village? We ran out of <em>rendang</em> before even the ceremony ended, so I’m sorry if you couldn’t eat <em>rendang</em>!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, we already ate chicken curry in Malikh Family, you don’t have to prepare food for us,” Grandpa Piss said.</p>\n<p>“How about breakfast? Are we still have leftover chickens, Yulong?”</p>\n<p>“We still have some leftover grilled village chicken, I’ll talk with the kitchen to reheat two portion first thing in the morning,” Yulong said.</p>\n<p>The Yashura Family’s patriarch was a role model of the stereotype Mossack people. He loved to cook and loved even more to feed people. It was no wonder why southern Mossacks’ visitors always felt welcomed whenever they visited the southern lands.</p>\n<p>“I sent them to bring <em>rendang</em> to Malikh Family, I never expected something like that to happen, hah!” Patriarch Shuro shook his head with a weak smile plastered on his face. During their talk, Grandpa Piss mentioned they met with Shira and Mila, as well mentioned the duel that happened between the two families’ young ladies and the upcoming duel between Shira and the young noble from Blackwood Family. “Whatever, if jerks wanted to fight with us, we won’t back down. Yashura Family never a coward!”</p>\n<p>“I believe Young Master Shira knows what he has to do,” Grandpa Piss assured.</p>\n<p>“I hope so, pity his father never around to hold the sky falling for him,” Patriarch Shuro gulped his <em>tuak</em>. “Anyway, let’s talk about something else. That Ghalim, you checked on him, Grandpa? What’s happened to him?”</p>\n<p>Snotty a little scared when Shuro Yashura suddenly brought up that topic. Snotty glanced at Butler Yulong’s wrinkled face, Yulong smiled back at him. The big muscle man couldn’t help but shuddered inside.</p>\n<p>“Patriarch Ghalim isn’t feeling well after eating some unhygienic food. I already prescribed some medicine for him, but I don’t know when he’d be able to get back at being patriarch since his digestive system was never good.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, is that so? Never knew he had something like that,” Patriarch Shuro mumbled. “There’s this really bad rumor about him being poisoned, Grandpa Piss, we never had something wicked like that in Badril Village.”</p>\n<p>“No, no no no, I can assure you, it’s not poison. I’ve been in the business more than seventy years--it’s <em>not</em> a poison.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss helped Yashura Family a lot when the patriarch’s in-law, Jhuro’s wife, had Shira in her belly. So Patriarch Shuro had long esteemed Grandpa Piss’s medicinal skill, even though he didn’t really had any idea how skillful the friendly old man was. He believed Grandpa Piss in the end.</p>\n<p>“We shouldn’t talk about sad things, Patriarch. Here, I bought a <em>tuak</em> my family handmade ourself. Let’s give it a try,” Grandpa Piss said.</p>\n<p>“Please, let me,” Butler Yulong asked the <em>tuak</em> bottle Grandpa Piss took out and poured it evenly to Patriarch Shuro’s, Grandpa Piss’s, along with Snotty’s glasses.</p>\n<p>The second thing Patriarch Shuro loved, after coconuts, was a strong <em>tuak</em>. He was the first one to gulp his glass clean, and he sighed about how good Grandpa Piss’s family <em>tuak</em> craft was. However, soon after that, his eyes somehow became heavy.</p>\n<p>“Huhh… usually, I still can drink till dawn…” Patriarch Shuro said with a yawn. “Let’s drink together… come on, Snotty, come drink with Uncle Shuro more.”</p>\n<p>“Patriarch, I think you are tired,” Yulong said softly, rejecting to pour patriarch’s glass.</p>\n<p>“Snotty, you go accompany Uncle Shuro inside,” Grandpa Piss said.</p>\n<p>Snotty nodded while still holding his glass full of <em>tuak</em>. The liquor was definitely mixed with something. Considering it was his grandfather who presented it, it was amazing to see Patriarch Shuro Yashura to be able to resist the urge to sleepiness. Snotty stood up and brought the yawning Shuro Yashura away.</p>\n<p>After both of them gone, Yulong picked up a clean glass. He poured the liquor that made Patriarch Shuro sleepy and drank it for himself. Grandpa Piss took out his second bottle and accompanied Yulong drinking <em>tuak</em>.</p>\n<p>“Is there’s something you need to discuss with me?” Yulong asked.</p>\n<p>“Indeed, it’s about Ghalim Malikh’s real condition…” Grandpa Piss didn’t leave any details when he told the Butler Yulong what had really happened in Malikh Family, particularly his discovery about the true nature of poison that made Patriarch Ghalim bedridden.</p>\n<p>When he heard that shocking fact, there was no surprise in the butler’s old face. Only sorrow and regret.</p>\n<p>“I knew this would happened,” Yulong sighed.</p>\n<p>“Then there’s Blackwood Family too…” Grandpa Piss’s sigh followed. “They seems interested in taking away Young Lady Bhela as a bride… I really don’t know what to say…”</p>\n<p>Yulong drank the <em>tuak</em> and told Grandpa Piss his reasoning, “That boy from Blackwood Family still hasn’t accepted Sir Jhuro’s decission to retire sixteen years ago. He’s been keeping quiet because he knew even the royalty and the organization behind him couldn’t protect him from Old Sir Lharu’s and Old Madam Sari’s retrubution. Time’s change. I reckon there’s some change somewhere that make him cocky.”</p>\n<p>“Old Sir and Old Madam too far away to give help in case something like this happens suddenly. Should I help you and Sir Jhuro keeping tabs on Blackwood Family?” Grandpa Piss asked.</p>\n<p>While Jhuro Yashura left behind resources and men outside before he retired, he almost never interacted with the high society of nobility. For ears and eyes to reach those fancy places, it would take time and efforts for current Yulong and Shuro Yashura to do so. It was way better to ask Grandpa Piss who already familiar due to his family’s generations of Alchemist profession. However, Yulong rejected the offer without giving it a real thought.</p>\n<p>“You don’t need to worry. Blackwood Family only taking a ride of that boy’s ambition. If he really supports his foster family right from the start, Blackwood won’t be stuck with their viscount nobility rank.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss wanted to offer any more help, but he long sensed the old butler’s distrust of him on affairs that didn’t include medicines and elixirs. So he kept his mouth shut for the time being.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, a golden owl landed on the veranda where the two old men enjoyed their <em>tuak</em>. The own brought a small piece of paper and inked quill with it.</p>\n<p>“Go, send this message to Sir Jhuro, as fast as possible!” Butler Yulong said to the owl after he wrote his tiny letter. Then he glanced at Grandpa Piss and said, “this is an owl I keep around in case there’s an emergency. Sir Jhuro also brought one with him.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss nodded with a painful smile. This golden owl was long thought to be extinct, but the reality there were small amounts of them were being kept in case of emergencies. They were rare, almost becoming birds of legend. Small to medium sized kingdoms wouldn’t dare to think getting their hands on it, not to mention Grandpa Piss’s own family. But this old butler had one with him. And the prodigial man of Yashura Family casually brought this treasure bird with him to travel around the southern land.</p>\n<p>“This is really for emergency,” Yulong said coldly, knowing full well the old Alchemist’s envy.</p>\n<p>“I know, I know--for emergency.”</p>\n<p>The owl then flew away bringing Yulong’s letter.</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss and Snotty returned back to their own village the next morning. After sending them away, Yulong found out the young master, Shira Yashura, wanted to go to the market to pick some goods for his contracted pedlers to sell. He was worried the young master’s inexperience getting him exploited. Therefore, he waited in the gate and followed the boy from behind.</p>\n<p>In front of an inn owned by Elzhier Family, Yulong saw a familiar eastern Kaya man came out with a respectable, but humble Mossack man behind him. The Kaya man, Sir Kurusiya, noticed Yulong, immediately cupped his fist and bowed his body. That was a salute of great respect eastern Kaya men usually give to people they regard highly. Sir Baront Staterwind didn’t know what was going on, so he imitated his companion to salute Yulong even though he didn’t really know he was only a butler.</p>\n<p>“You know them, Yulong?” Shira asked.</p>\n<p>“The Kaya man once works in the same place as your father, young master.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, that’s why you know him.” Yulong was his mother helper, and his father brought him along to Yashura Family when Shira still in his mother’s belly. Shira never liked to listen about his father’s past, even though it was often glorified since he was completely stopped marauding bandits from approaching Badril Village. Walking toward the market, Shira kept quiet and didn’t ask the matter any further.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Far away from Badril Village, the golden owl Yulong tasked with the emergency letter flew through walls of mist and mountains. It instinctively knew the location of its recipient, Jhuro Yashura, even though Yulong wasn’t necesserarily knew where he was. Not even a half day passed by since the bird took off from Yashura Family, it flew already more than halfway toward its destination.</p>\n<p>Its speed was unprecendeted amongst the magical beast. No wonder commonfolks thought it was the bird of the legend. It was a shame that it failed to detect a single flash on the horizon, resulting it to succumb to a terrible fate.</p>\n<p><em>Flap flap flap!</em></p>\n<p>The owl futilely tried to avoid danger.</p>\n<p>A single flash all it took to capture the dumbfounded owl. A pair of cold talons gripped its short neck and the next thing it knew, the owl panically flapping its wings in search of oxygen, only to be deprived of fresh air even more. The owl couldn’t see the beast, it only saw a dashingly crimson flash before it was captured by the neck. The hostile beast scretched, only after that the owl realized a damned predator eagle already got it. Annoyed by the owl’s desperate struggle, the eagle broke its neck. The handsome crimson-colored eagle then delivered the dead owl to a mysterious masked man, who then passed it to another man--a pale, thin man who only dressed himself as black as the phantom itself.</p>\n<p>“This owl coming out from Yashura Family, Mister Blackwood. The bird brings a letter with it,” the masked man said as he presented the letter to the pale man.</p>\n<p>“Ah, so they figured it out about the poison,” the pale man with Blackwood surname said. Beside him and the masked man, there was a third man who drained the blood of the golden owl, prepared a little feast of its dead body. The man was very peculiar; bald, with veined oversized muscles that looked like it was almost exploded, and the strange tatooes that covered its body. He was a northern barbarian, the kind that never took orders from civilized men no matter they came from the west, south, or the east. Yet, when the Blackwood guy told him top plucking the dead owl, he obidiently put aside the carcass, not daring to show any hints of disatisfaction.</p>\n<p>“Mister, the young lady of Malikh Family turns out to be a four-elemental Unique Class, she’s a real talent with tremendous potential--your sister tries to take her to Blackwood Family and having a setback because there’s some experts happened to visit Malikh Family. Shall we send anymore resources to help her?”</p>\n<p>“What’s her Blackwood Family have to do with me? It’s already good enough I let her to use my name to coerce people and strengthen her influence in commerce world. She’s getting annoying every time she’s using my toys. That Jhuju’s poison I sent to her only a reminder to Ghalim of our old friendship, my sister should be thankful enough if she gets some benefits from it.”</p>\n<p>The masked man knew the pale man was irritated by his sister’s cockiness. So he excused himself and brought the crimson eagle with him, disappearing into the shadow.</p>\n<p>“We’ve rested enough,” the pale man said as he crumbled the small letter he read. The bald barbarian’s head cocked and he await the order. “Prepare the horses,” the man continued, “I’ve got an old friend I should say hi to.”</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-4/chapter-5":"<authors-note id=\"Radhy\" type=\"danger\">\n<p>I don’t recommend reading from here onwards because the chapter below is still from the previous draft, which is different from the previous 4 chapters. Further edits will be made that most likely makes this chapter quite different than the current one.</p>\n</authors-note>\n<p>In a certain hall in Malikh Family’s left wing complex, four people sat idly on the bamboo mats covered floor. They were being served local-specialty ginger drinks mixed with brown sugar with herbs to drink. There were also some roasted peanuts to chew. Despite they dressed humbly when attending the Ngajen Ceremony, three of them were elders with statuses, while one of them, the sword bearing Kaya man, wasn’t anyone to ignore either.</p>\n<p>Having knowing this, they still waiting for their host, Bhela Malikh, to wrap up the Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>“Still,” Madame Sylvia said after a sip of ginger drink, “I wouldn’t have expected the girl’s talent to be that rare when she approached my sect with the invitation. The top brass only interested of her being the top grade during the seminar thus sent me to check her out. How about you, Mister Harrington?”</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t expecting it either. I only interested when the report said she showed a potential of being two elemental-affinities Archer. Three already great, but with four elementals, chances she’ll get her name down in history books.”</p>\n<p>“That is what happen if she able to live long enough to develop her full potential,” the quiet man with sharp aura remarked. His face was thin, rough, and since he never liked to smile, he always looked like he meant business. The man was role model of eastern Kaya race ancient warriors--stand and sit in straight posture, humorless, and most importantly, always bringing the sharp, thin sword of katana on his hips.</p>\n<p>Madame Sylvia was interested on his remark. So she asked, “Oh, why you think of that, Sir Kurusiya?”</p>\n<p>The eastern man replied, “Because she tangled herself with Blackwood Family,” he paused. “If this Blackwood the same one from this Blackwood guy I know, then it’s definitely a bad news for her.”</p>\n<p>Mister Harrington from Elemental Stone School disagreed.</p>\n<p>“Since when our factions become soft?” he questioned. “We’re not that pitiful to handle some second-rate noble family. Honestly, I think that young man from that Blackwood Family such a pest. If Young Lady Bhela asks for my favor, I’ll handle him cleanly and thoroughly--right here, right now.”</p>\n<p>“I’m not talking about Blackwood Family, I’m talking about the creepy guy with Blackwood as his last name,” Sir Kurusiya said as he put down his ginger drink. He wasn’t happy, so Madame Sylvia signaled Mister Harrington that it best not to continue arguing with the scary eastern Kaya man.</p>\n<p>The hall suddenly turned quiet. Then, the fourth man was happily enjoyed his drink, out of the blue he blurted for his opinion that no one asked for. “That boy from Yashura Family is sure interesting…”</p>\n<p>Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia smiled wryly. Nobody said anything about Yashura Family up until now. The fourth man, Baront Staterwind, came from a very peculiar faction. Which actually had nothing to do with Bhela’s type of talent. Even when he had already came to Badril Village, none would think he accepted Bhela Malikh’s invitation just to scout her talent.</p>\n<p>The hall’s door was knocked. Bhela entered. She politely greeted the four respected guests before she sat down.</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry for the wait, dear elders. Malikh Family hasn’t prepared the best dishes for you during the ceremony, so I asked the best chef we have to cook special meals for you,” Bhela said, then she glanced at the door. “Please enter, aunty!”</p>\n<p>The moment she called, a middle-aged woman who helped Bhela in the kitchen before came with a line of maidservants, bringing freshly cooked dinner meals with them. It was better than what the Malikhs served for the guests before, even compared to the meals served for the family’s important guests cooked by Bhela as the chief chef.</p>\n<p>“I rather you serve me some alcohol,” the eastern Sir Kurusiya said to her.</p>\n<p>Bhela nodded at his request and asked the aunty to fetch the best alcohol she could find. Of course, the best person to get help was the elder who provided Bhela with the hall to host her guests. Bhela hoped the said elder already knew the importance of this meeting thus not being stingy with his alcohol collection.</p>\n<p>“Can we start now, young lady? I don’t have a good alcohol tolerance so I rather get this completed before us adults get to drink,” Madame Sylvia said.</p>\n<p>“We have delicious food here served, Madame Sylvia. To be honest, all the wait before is for the aunties preparing dinner for dear elders,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>But not of the adults believed her words easily.</p>\n<p>“Hoho, you seem so nervous, young lady. You might not look like it, but you seem about to cry,” Sir Baront Staterwind said.</p>\n<p>“Just state what you want from us, don’t waste anymore time,” Sir Kurusiya urged.</p>\n<p>Bhela lowered her head. With her lips tremblingly parted, she said, “As you might know, my father fell ill when I was overseas attending the seminar. My mother has contacted many doctors and alchemists to make medicines for him, yet my father’s condition never improved. I request for elders’ wisdom and strength, please help my poor father, he was in misery for months…”</p>\n<p>Bhela prostated.</p>\n<p>“Please, help me father… he’s dying… please…” she begged.</p>\n<p>Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia exchanged glances. The peculiar beardy man, Sir Baront, merely nodded without letting his thoughts known. Meanwhile, Sir Kurusiya, who didn’t bulge seeing the pretty girl begging in front of him, coldly said, “Well, this is really a waste of time.”</p>\n<p>Hearing the eastern man snorted, Bhela’s heart went cold. She prepared herself bowing down for help, without stating a single offer to prove how desperate herself.</p>\n<p>“And, young lady…” Madame Sylvia asked slowly, “what would you do if someone managed to heal your father?”</p>\n<p>Bhela rose up. She looked straight to Madam Sylvia’s gaze, then said, “Anything,”</p>\n<p>“Anything?”</p>\n<p>“Anything.”</p>\n<p>The room went quiet. Only Mister Harrington’s regretful sigh could be heard.</p>\n<p>It was Sir Baront Staterwind who explained with a good intention, “It really seems you haven’t grasped the situation you were in, young lady. The guest who gave you the gift from before, he’s a young master of a family known as the peerless medicine makers and doctors. If they couldn’t cure your father illness, then I believe no one in this room knows who really can.”</p>\n<p>“If I had a petty mind, young lady, I’d kill for the cosmetic you got from them. That’s how valuable their skills are,” Madam Sylvia said as she shook her head in pity.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh bit her lips. She was eloquent when she invited these experts months ago. Yet tonight, she had completely became tongue-tied and defeated. The cold air suddenly felt more unbearable. Although the warm meals’ delicious aroma wafted through the hall, not a single person had any incentive to touch their food. Everyone in the hall sunken into silence.</p>\n<p>“You want my advice, young lady?” the sharp voice of Sir Kurusiya sliced through the awkward atmosphere. He continued, “Having turned your back against Yashura Family is the dumbest decision you did. I didn’t come here because of you. I know your father, and I certainly know that swordsman from Yashura Family more. It’s a pity I couldn’t meet them today. Really, a complete waste miles and miles of journey.”</p>\n<p>With that, Sir Kurusiya, stood up and prepared to leave.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh quickly swallowed her bitterness, also stood up and said, “Please, Elder Kurusiya, let me see you the way out.”</p>\n<p>“No, don’t,” Sir Kurusiya flatly rejected her offer. “Sit down. These three fogies still haven’t decided what they want to do with you. Better think carefully about what you’re going to say to them next.”</p>\n<p>The eastern man saw himself out. Following his suggestion, Bhela Malikh sat down again and faced the three experts, with her mind suddenly became as blank as a barren field in the corner of abandoned land. She didn’t know what she ought to say to them, seeing the looks of pity they directed at her. Then, just when she managed to regain her bravery to say something, the door slammed open--</p>\n<p>“I come as the representative of Blackwood Family!” Young Master Frane Blackwood boldly yelled.</p>\n<p>He swagered himself in along with Elder Jhamil’s son and the adjutant of Blackwood Family under his wings. The arrogant behaviour of this young noble completely disregard the experts in the room. Madame Sylvia had enough. She dissed him, “What are you doing here uninvited?”</p>\n<p>Instead of the adjutant who usually spoke for his young master, it was the young elder of Malikh Family, Elder Jhamil’s son who replying. “This madam has eyes but doesn’t know what good for her. Of course Young Master Blackwood is invited! He’s the special guest of Malikh Family after all!”</p>\n<p>“What’s your name, boy?” the middle-aged woman hissed.</p>\n<p>“I’m Elder Jhamil’s eldest son! What’s up with you, you don’t have the right to know my name!”</p>\n<p>“Is that it? Very well. It seems just because I respect the southerner custom by dressing commonly you ignorant people already forgot what's best for you. Very well!”</p>\n<p><em>Zziiing!</em></p>\n<p>With a flashing draw of metallic sword, Madame Sylvia stood up to give this ignorant young elder a lesson. But her companion Mister Harrington quickly pulled her back before things really blown up.</p>\n<p>“You brought a weapon with you!” the Elder Jhamil’s son screamed with his finger pointing at Madame Sylvia who already trembling holding back her fury. “Do you not know what’s gonna happen to guests who bring weapons inside their host’s home?”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood rolled his eyes and told his adjutant, “Send this toad out of here, he’s too noisy!”</p>\n<p>“Right away,” the adjutant said. Then with his bony hands, he pulled the screaming Elder Jhamil’s son forcefully.</p>\n<p>“Is the discussion still ongoing?” Frane Blackwood asked the sitting guests as he tightened the blue necktie he wore. He said to Bhela, “Blackwood Family offers a lifetime terms of benefit for you, young lady. Not only medicines, if it boost potion you ask, or equipments, magic items, weapons--you name it, we have all things you’d dare to imagine!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho,” his uninvited offer gave Sir Baront Staterwind a chuckle. The three guests Bhela invited hailed from their own factions, so even if they wanted to rope Bhela in, they would consult with their higher ups about the specific terms they’d give to her as benefits. However, Blackwood Family was, in fact, only a noble family, not an organizational faction, with the only way in was through marriage--so of course the young noble would be able to offer a “lifetime benefits” to her so brazenly.</p>\n<p>“Thank you for holding back your anger, Madame Sylvia,” Bhela completely bowed her head to the angry guest while she completely disregarded Young Master Blackwood’s offers.</p>\n<p>Madame Sylvia nodded. She then looked at Young Master Blackwood and snorted. “Young lady, think carefully about what we said before. Some incapable people only able to spout honey trap to get what they want. Don’t be foolish because your father’s situation.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you for the advice…”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood wanted to argue with this lady. But he also held himself back as he didn’t know the other party’s identity. Therefore, all he could do was haughtily smiling elegantly as a proper noble as he was.</p>\n<p>“Has the discussion already started?” Frane Blackwood asked again. Pity him, not even one interested in answering. Because of that his face became red as he fumed with anger.</p>\n<p>“Ah,” Sir Baront Staterwind looked outside the window and slapped his thigh, “look how late it is! I planned to sleep early because I have something I need to do tomorrow early in the morning!”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh quickly offered to see him till the gate.</p>\n<p>“Hoho, how about you two?” Sir Baront asked the last two foreign experts, the pair of middle-aged man and woman, “overstaying your visit is considering a burden to these good Mossack folks, don’t you think so?”</p>\n<p>“I’m but an ignorant western lady, I know little about the way of the southern people, so please don’t mind us being shameless,” Madame Sylvia said. She then looked at Bhela, “Young Lady Bhela, Mister Harrington and I apparently haven’t booked our place in the village’s inns. We don’t know our talks would turned out dragged this late. For this I have to beg you to let us stay in Malikh Family for a few good days.”</p>\n<p>“Hoho…” Sir Baront Staterwind chuckled as he looked at the poker face pair of experts. Wasn’t the four of them--including Sir Kurusiya, checked in the same inn this afternoon? It was clear Madame Sylvia and Mister Harrington had their own intentions, thus Sir Baront Staterwind shrugged the idea of exposing their little white lies.</p>\n<p>And with that, Bhela Malikh led the three expert guests she invited out of the room. Young Master Blackwood, who was ignored so hard she almost exploded, yelling, “Young Lady Bhela!”</p>\n<p>Bhela turned around. “Yes, Young Master Blackwood?”</p>\n<p>“How about me?”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh blinked. Then she picked a bowl of roasted peanuts and approached him, saying softly, “Please sit down and enjoy this snack. I need to attend to my guests.”</p>\n<p>Hearing her soft, yet slightly cold voice, Young Lady Blackwood the understood something that made him excited, so excited he obediently sat down and nimbled on the roasted peanuts the beautiful Young Lady Bhela gave him.</p>\n<p>Then after Bhela brought the guests out, the Blackwood Family adjutant who was waiting outside came in inside the hall.</p>\n<p>“What are you doing?!” Young Master Blackwood hissed.</p>\n<p>The adjutant gawked. “Young master, I’m here to serve you…”</p>\n<p>“Serve me?” the young master cringed. What a joke! Soon he’d have a time being alone with Young Lady Bhela, and this old man wanted to be here right when he had the chance of his lifetime? What if there--during the discussion--was an accident where he had to be responsible as a man? Would he be happy if the adjutant was here when that happened?</p>\n<p>Absolutely not!</p>\n<p>“Get out! Don’t dawdle around here tonight! I need to discuss an important manner with Young Lady Bhela secretly!”</p>\n<p>“Y-young master--”</p>\n<p>“What are you waiting for! Go back to the inn and don’t bother me till the next morning!”</p>\n<p>The adjutant naturally understood what was inside the young master’s mind. He didn’t dare to linger around. With careful steps, he closed the door and went back to the inn Blackwood Family checked in.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Young Master Blackwood was so excited he couldn’t sit calmly alone in the hall. The thought of having private discussion with a girl as pretty as Bhela Malikh made him thinking a lot of things. Slowly, he getting horny.</p>\n<p>“What is taking her so long?” he mumbled to himself after waiting a fruitless thirty minutes. “Is it maybe she needs to… prepare, herself?”</p>\n<p>If it was going to be her first time, of course she needed time to prepare herself, Young Master Blackwood thought. This young noble had “befriend” and participating in “private discussions” with many experienced women. But virgin girls, he never tasted any.</p>\n<p>Because of that, he willing to wait however much longer for the young lady to prepare herself. And thus, after waiting for another thirty minutes, nothing happened. Nothing happened for the next hour as well. Then, after waiting for nearly three hours alone, the door finally opened…</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela, you finally ready!” Young Master Blackwood snapped out of his sleepy face and excitedly came to greet the visitor. Much to his disappointment, the visitor turned out to be the faithful adjutant.</p>\n<p>“Why is that you?!” Young Master Blackwood roared.</p>\n<p>“Y-young master… let’s get back to the inn,” the adjutant nervously asked.</p>\n<p>“Where’s Young Lady Bhela?”</p>\n<p>“She is in her room…”</p>\n<p>“Then you send someone there to ask her when she’s going to meet me,” the young noble ordered.</p>\n<p>“I’m afraid I can’t… young master…”</p>\n<p>“I’ve been waiting for hours, why?”</p>\n<p>The adjutant gulped before he replied.</p>\n<p>“Because the young lady has already gone sleeping since three hours ago!”</p>\n<p>So much for his dreamy private discussion! Young Master Blackwood was so angry for being misled that he slapped the adjutant’s face all the way back to his inn.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A single torch on a stick stubbornly lit the corner of the village in spite of the strong wind. A howling wolf in the distance reinforced the lone, cold sense of the midnight Badril Village. The only shop that still open at this hours could be counted with one hand, and this liquor shop was one of them. No customer visited it except a foreign eastern Kaya man.</p>\n<p>A series of step could be heard. The sleepy shopkeeper snapped back when he heard a new customer approaching.</p>\n<p>“Give me a glass of <em>tuak</em>, shopkeeper,” the new customer ordered with a booming voice. One could see his beardy feature when his face exposed to the shop’s lantern light. “Mind if I join you, Sir Kurusiya?”</p>\n<p>The eastern man didn’t reply. He drank his alcohol instead.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront Staterwind laughed by his cold treatment. The beardy guy was an easygoing person, so he casually grabbed a bowl of steamed peanuts and started to nibble on those snacks.</p>\n<p>“You’re not visiting Bhela’s father? You said you know him, you know, saying hi to a sick old buddy?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t say hi to a dying man,” Sir Kurusiya said.</p>\n<p>The answer made the air awkward. So Sir Baront quickly came with another topic.</p>\n<p>“It seems those two lovers adamant to protect the girl,” he said, referring to the other two experts who once were couple before Mister Harrington lost Madame Sylvia to another guy. “Or I think they just want some privacy to have some little reunion… who knows?”</p>\n<p>Sir Kurusiya never bothered with petty gossip, he callously replied, “They don’t know Malikh Family. They can’t protect her forever.”</p>\n<p>“Exactly,” Sir Baront Staterwind agreed. After that both men continued drinking without saying anything.</p>\n<p>“Hey shopkeeper,” Sir Baront called, “don’t you have anything with less alcohol? I have a business I’d like to deal with tomorrow, so I want to avoid shitty hangover.”</p>\n<p>“I have some sweet <em>tuak</em>,” the shopkeeper poured a new bottle into Sir Baront’s empty glass, “this one usually for them boys who haven’t gone coming of age ceremony. No alcohol, costs as little as four copper kobe coins.”</p>\n<p>“Four coppers, ah! Why’s that the souther I go the cheaper the drink?” he sipped it, “mm! Pretty good, my good man!”</p>\n<p>He tipped the shopkeeper with a silver coin. The shopkeeper was dumbfounded but quickly recovered and hid the coin safely.</p>\n<p>Sir Kurusiya said to Sir Baront, “You want to go to Yashura Family tomorrow?”</p>\n<p>“How did you know?”</p>\n<p>“Even though I can’t see him, I know the one who repelled Bhela’s arrow was a Nalaq,” Sir Kurusiya said.</p>\n<p>“Hoho, since I managed to rope in the young lady of Yurin Family, I’ve got promoted to an instructor,” Sir Baront smiled widely. “Doing the legwork isn’t my job anymore… but checking him and the boy won’t hurt, so I’m going. Hmm, I wonder if the Nalaq has already form his contract?”</p>\n<p>“Huuh…” the shopkeeper, who had been hearing their chatting, couldn’t help but asked, “you good sir, what’s this talking about a Nalaq having to do with Yashura Family?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, you’re a Yashura?” Sir Baront asked.</p>\n<p>“I’m Elzhier, from the outer family,” the shopkeeper said. “I’ve been in this village for forty years, but never I’ve heard any Nalaq passing by.”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, that’s why I’m going. Usually a rogue Nalaq isn’t someone tied with a faction, so they aren’t that big of deal--which also make them easier to rope in!”</p>\n<p>“Ooohh! Are you a Nalaq expert, mister? From overseas? Our family’s eldest young lady actually was scouted by a passing expert from overseas too, an expert from purple something sect!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, you mean Purple Garden Sect?” Sir Baront Staterwind and asked as he played along.</p>\n<p>But Sir Kurusiya was sceptic. “Purple Garden Sect is too far. And someone from that kind of superpower faction won’t be too idle to accidentally passing by on this kind of rural village.”</p>\n<p>Sir Baront nodded at Sir Kurusiya’s logic. Even if it was that particular sect that accepted the said young lady, both experts wouldn’t be too sure about whether she could be the sect’s legitimate disciple. Their doubts made the shopkeeper embarrassed. Since ten years ago, the tales of the eldest young lady of Elzhier Family being accepted by a foreign expert was a legend amongst Badril Village locals. Except her and the recent Malikh Family’s young lady, no one in the village was lucky got scouted to study oversea, so it became a fact that Elzhier Family was very proud of--and was one of the reasons why the Elzhier could win the village head’s seat from Yashura Family after their decades of leading Badril Village. But the problem was, in the letters their young lady sent home, she always talked about shops, fashions, and some other trivial stuffs that usually young women her age excited about. That made even her father, the current Elzhier Family’s patriarch and the Village Head, felt it was became difficult to still boasting the young lady’s status after ten years of her spending overseas.</p>\n<p>“But still, experts, you might not know this, but our eldest young lady was Young Lady of Malikh Family’s closest childhood friend! When Young Lady Bhela Malikh only a little girl our young lady gave her a lot of pointers and knowledge, so much that I assure that if it wasn’t for her being there for Young Lady Bhela, the Malikh Family wouldn’t get their talented Unique Class for at least the next one hundred years!”</p>\n<p>“Right…” Sir Baront became awkward instantly. To think some ignorant folks believed blessing of Unique Classes was that simple, even Sir Kurusiya scoffed at the idea.</p>\n<p>The shopkeeper’s face became red as he realized it was wise not to delay any longer. So he quickly said, “If you have some spare time, sir experts, I’m sure our Elzhier Family willing to entertain you!”</p>\n<p>After paying for their drinks, even the agreeable Sir Baront Staterwind felt it was very awkward for him to return to this little shop. Both decided not to get themselves involved with Elzhier Family after the shopkeeper’s little salesman talks, whilst not knowing the inn they stayed inn owned by Elzhier Family.</p>\n<p>On the way back, Sir Baront asked Sir Kurusiya for advice.</p>\n<p>“Yo, Kurusiya, I’m going to accept the Yashura boy as my third disciple if the Nalaq’s pretty good. But, you know, the Nalaq who contracted with youngest disciple is a master thirteen thousands years ago. She was a heavy weight figure, so I reckon I’ll let her calls the shot. What’s your opinion on this?”</p>\n<p>“How powerful is this Nalaq you’re talking about?”</p>\n<p>Sir Baront grinned. “You know the legend about Seven Pillars of Tiramikal Continent? She’s the Frost Mage mentioned in that history. Pretty neat, huh? She was able to revive as Nalaq and regained her consciousness five years ago. All the big shots in my Blue Robe Society can’t wait for the girl she’s contracted with to formally accepted into our faction.”</p>\n<p>“If that’s the case then your disciple isn’t necesserily worse than Malikh’s four elemental Archer girl.”</p>\n<p>“So you know why I can’t accept the boy if he’s too crude--I can’t afford to offend this madam Nalaq even the slightest bit.” he took out a bag of roasted peanuts he bought from the shopkeeper, and started to nibble on them. “I’m going to write a letter to my disciples, they’ve been playing around in the neighboring village. This madam Nalaq will come and check the boy herself.”</p>\n<p>Sir Kurusiya abruptly stopped his steps.</p>\n<p>“You want my advice?” he looked straight at Sir Baront’s eyes. “My advice is simple. You’re going to make this madam Nalaq of yours polite and you’re going to beg her to be mindful of her attitude in front of Yashura Family.”</p>\n<p>“You’re joking? You serious?”</p>\n<p>“I’m always serious,” Sir Kurusiya said.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Patriarch of Yashura Family, Shuro Yashura, was exhilarated to see Grandpa Piss and Snotty came to visit the village. One part because he treasured the friendships between their family and Grandpa Piss’s relatives, but mainly, he got to show-off his latest coconut cake recipe.</p>\n<p>“Ah, this is life, drinking <em>tuak</em> when we’re watching the moon, getting drunk while we’re eating coconuts. What a life!” Patriarch Shuro mumbled.</p>\n<p>“What a life indeed,” Grandpa Piss nodded with a low chuckle. On the sky, the full moon was shining bright really beautiful.</p>\n<p>After he’d done his part in ngajen ceremony, Patriarch Shuro Yashura accompanied the old Alchemist and his grandson in a spacious veranda, where they ate coconut cakes and drinking _tuak _while spending time moongazing. They had the Yashura Family’s sole butler, Yulong, to hold the _tuak _bottle and refilled their cups when empty.</p>\n<p>“Grandpa Piss, why didn’t you tell us beforehand before you visit Badril Village? We ran out of <em>rendang</em> before even the ceremony ended, so I’m sorry if you couldn’t eat <em>rendang</em>!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, we already ate chicken curry in Malikh Family, you don’t have to prepare food for us,” Grandpa Piss said.</p>\n<p>“How about breakfast? Are we still have leftover chickens, Yulong?”</p>\n<p>“We still have some leftover grilled village chicken, I’ll talk with the kitchen to reheat two portion first thing in the morning,” Yulong said.</p>\n<p>The Yashura Family’s patriarch was a role model of the stereotype Mossack people. He loved to cook and loved even more to feed people. It was no wonder why southern Mossacks’ visitors always felt welcomed whenever they visited the southern lands.</p>\n<p>“I sent them to bring <em>rendang</em> to Malikh Family, I never expected something like that to happen, hah!” Patriarch Shuro shook his head with a weak smile plastered on his face. During their talk, Grandpa Piss mentioned they met with Shira and Mila, as well mentioned the duel that happened between the two families’ young ladies and the upcoming duel between Shira and the young noble from Blackwood Family. “Whatever, if jerks wanted to fight with us, we won’t back down. Yashura Family never a coward!”</p>\n<p>“I believe Young Master Shira knows what he has to do,” Grandpa Piss assured.</p>\n<p>“I hope so, pity his father never around to hold the sky falling for him,” Patriarch Shuro gulped his <em>tuak</em>. “Anyway, let’s talk about something else. That Ghalim, you checked on him, Grandpa? What’s happened to him?”</p>\n<p>Snotty a little scared when Shuro Yashura suddenly brought up that topic. Snotty glanced at Butler Yulong’s wrinkled face, Yulong smiled back at him. The big muscle man couldn’t help but shuddered inside.</p>\n<p>“Patriarch Ghalim isn’t feeling well after eating some unhygienic food. I already prescribed some medicine for him, but I don’t know when he’d be able to get back at being patriarch since his digestive system was never good.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, is that so? Never knew he had something like that,” Patriarch Shuro mumbled. “There’s this really bad rumor about him being poisoned, Grandpa Piss, we never had something wicked like that in Badril Village.”</p>\n<p>“No, no no no, I can assure you, it’s not poison. I’ve been in the business more than seventy years--it’s <em>not</em> a poison.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss helped Yashura Family a lot when the patriarch’s in-law, Jhuro’s wife, had Shira in her belly. So Patriarch Shuro had long esteemed Grandpa Piss’s medicinal skill, even though he didn’t really had any idea how skillful the friendly old man was. He believed Grandpa Piss in the end.</p>\n<p>“We shouldn’t talk about sad things, Patriarch. Here, I bought a <em>tuak</em> my family handmade ourself. Let’s give it a try,” Grandpa Piss said.</p>\n<p>“Please, let me,” Butler Yulong asked the <em>tuak</em> bottle Grandpa Piss took out and poured it evenly to Patriarch Shuro’s, Grandpa Piss’s, along with Snotty’s glasses.</p>\n<p>The second thing Patriarch Shuro loved, after coconuts, was a strong <em>tuak</em>. He was the first one to gulp his glass clean, and he sighed about how good Grandpa Piss’s family <em>tuak</em> craft was. However, soon after that, his eyes somehow became heavy.</p>\n<p>“Huhh… usually, I still can drink till dawn…” Patriarch Shuro said with a yawn. “Let’s drink together… come on, Snotty, come drink with Uncle Shuro more.”</p>\n<p>“Patriarch, I think you are tired,” Yulong said softly, rejecting to pour patriarch’s glass.</p>\n<p>“Snotty, you go accompany Uncle Shuro inside,” Grandpa Piss said.</p>\n<p>Snotty nodded while still holding his glass full of <em>tuak</em>. The liquor was definitely mixed with something. Considering it was his grandfather who presented it, it was amazing to see Patriarch Shuro Yashura to be able to resist the urge to sleepiness. Snotty stood up and brought the yawning Shuro Yashura away.</p>\n<p>After both of them gone, Yulong picked up a clean glass. He poured the liquor that made Patriarch Shuro sleepy and drank it for himself. Grandpa Piss took out his second bottle and accompanied Yulong drinking <em>tuak</em>.</p>\n<p>“Is there’s something you need to discuss with me?” Yulong asked.</p>\n<p>“Indeed, it’s about Ghalim Malikh’s real condition…” Grandpa Piss didn’t leave any details when he told the Butler Yulong what had really happened in Malikh Family, particularly his discovery about the true nature of poison that made Patriarch Ghalim bedridden.</p>\n<p>When he heard that shocking fact, there was no surprise in the butler’s old face. Only sorrow and regret.</p>\n<p>“I knew this would happened,” Yulong sighed.</p>\n<p>“Then there’s Blackwood Family too…” Grandpa Piss’s sigh followed. “They seems interested in taking away Young Lady Bhela as a bride… I really don’t know what to say…”</p>\n<p>Yulong drank the <em>tuak</em> and told Grandpa Piss his reasoning, “That boy from Blackwood Family still hasn’t accepted Sir Jhuro’s decission to retire sixteen years ago. He’s been keeping quiet because he knew even the royalty and the organization behind him couldn’t protect him from Old Sir Lharu’s and Old Madam Sari’s retrubution. Time’s change. I reckon there’s some change somewhere that make him cocky.”</p>\n<p>“Old Sir and Old Madam too far away to give help in case something like this happens suddenly. Should I help you and Sir Jhuro keeping tabs on Blackwood Family?” Grandpa Piss asked.</p>\n<p>While Jhuro Yashura left behind resources and men outside before he retired, he almost never interacted with the high society of nobility. For ears and eyes to reach those fancy places, it would take time and efforts for current Yulong and Shuro Yashura to do so. It was way better to ask Grandpa Piss who already familiar due to his family’s generations of Alchemist profession. However, Yulong rejected the offer without giving it a real thought.</p>\n<p>“You don’t need to worry. Blackwood Family only taking a ride of that boy’s ambition. If he really supports his foster family right from the start, Blackwood won’t be stuck with their viscount nobility rank.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss wanted to offer any more help, but he long sensed the old butler’s distrust of him on affairs that didn’t include medicines and elixirs. So he kept his mouth shut for the time being.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, a golden owl landed on the veranda where the two old men enjoyed their <em>tuak</em>. The own brought a small piece of paper and inked quill with it.</p>\n<p>“Go, send this message to Sir Jhuro, as fast as possible!” Butler Yulong said to the owl after he wrote his tiny letter. Then he glanced at Grandpa Piss and said, “this is an owl I keep around in case there’s an emergency. Sir Jhuro also brought one with him.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss nodded with a painful smile. This golden owl was long thought to be extinct, but the reality there were small amounts of them were being kept in case of emergencies. They were rare, almost becoming birds of legend. Small to medium sized kingdoms wouldn’t dare to think getting their hands on it, not to mention Grandpa Piss’s own family. But this old butler had one with him. And the prodigial man of Yashura Family casually brought this treasure bird with him to travel around the southern land.</p>\n<p>“This is really for emergency,” Yulong said coldly, knowing full well the old Alchemist’s envy.</p>\n<p>“I know, I know--for emergency.”</p>\n<p>The owl then flew away bringing Yulong’s letter.</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss and Snotty returned back to their own village the next morning. After sending them away, Yulong found out the young master, Shira Yashura, wanted to go to the market to pick some goods for his contracted pedlers to sell. He was worried the young master’s inexperience getting him exploited. Therefore, he waited in the gate and followed the boy from behind.</p>\n<p>In front of an inn owned by Elzhier Family, Yulong saw a familiar eastern Kaya man came out with a respectable, but humble Mossack man behind him. The Kaya man, Sir Kurusiya, noticed Yulong, immediately cupped his fist and bowed his body. That was a salute of great respect eastern Kaya men usually give to people they regard highly. Sir Baront Staterwind didn’t know what was going on, so he imitated his companion to salute Yulong even though he didn’t really know he was only a butler.</p>\n<p>“You know them, Yulong?” Shira asked.</p>\n<p>“The Kaya man once works in the same place as your father, young master.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, that’s why you know him.” Yulong was his mother helper, and his father brought him along to Yashura Family when Shira still in his mother’s belly. Shira never liked to listen about his father’s past, even though it was often glorified since he was completely stopped marauding bandits from approaching Badril Village. Walking toward the market, Shira kept quiet and didn’t ask the matter any further.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Far away from Badril Village, the golden owl Yulong tasked with the emergency letter flew through walls of mist and mountains. It instinctively knew the location of its recipient, Jhuro Yashura, even though Yulong wasn’t necesserarily knew where he was. Not even a half day passed by since the bird took off from Yashura Family, it flew already more than halfway toward its destination.</p>\n<p>Its speed was unprecendeted amongst the magical beast. No wonder commonfolks thought it was the bird of the legend. It was a shame that it failed to detect a single flash on the horizon, resulting it to succumb to a terrible fate.</p>\n<p><em>Flap flap flap!</em></p>\n<p>The owl futilely tried to avoid danger.</p>\n<p>A single flash all it took to capture the dumbfounded owl. A pair of cold talons gripped its short neck and the next thing it knew, the owl panically flapping its wings in search of oxygen, only to be deprived of fresh air even more. The owl couldn’t see the beast, it only saw a dashingly crimson flash before it was captured by the neck. The hostile beast scretched, only after that the owl realized a damned predator eagle already got it. Annoyed by the owl’s desperate struggle, the eagle broke its neck. The handsome crimson-colored eagle then delivered the dead owl to a mysterious masked man, who then passed it to another man--a pale, thin man who only dressed himself as black as the phantom itself.</p>\n<p>“This owl coming out from Yashura Family, Mister Blackwood. The bird brings a letter with it,” the masked man said as he presented the letter to the pale man.</p>\n<p>“Ah, so they figured it out about the poison,” the pale man with Blackwood surname said. Beside him and the masked man, there was a third man who drained the blood of the golden owl, prepared a little feast of its dead body. The man was very peculiar; bald, with veined oversized muscles that looked like it was almost exploded, and the strange tatooes that covered its body. He was a northern barbarian, the kind that never took orders from civilized men no matter they came from the west, south, or the east. Yet, when the Blackwood guy told him top plucking the dead owl, he obidiently put aside the carcass, not daring to show any hints of disatisfaction.</p>\n<p>“Mister, the young lady of Malikh Family turns out to be a four-elemental Unique Class, she’s a real talent with tremendous potential--your sister tries to take her to Blackwood Family and having a setback because there’s some experts happened to visit Malikh Family. Shall we send anymore resources to help her?”</p>\n<p>“What’s her Blackwood Family have to do with me? It’s already good enough I let her to use my name to coerce people and strengthen her influence in commerce world. She’s getting annoying every time she’s using my toys. That Jhuju’s poison I sent to her only a reminder to Ghalim of our old friendship, my sister should be thankful enough if she gets some benefits from it.”</p>\n<p>The masked man knew the pale man was irritated by his sister’s cockiness. So he excused himself and brought the crimson eagle with him, disappearing into the shadow.</p>\n<p>“We’ve rested enough,” the pale man said as he crumbled the small letter he read. The bald barbarian’s head cocked and he await the order. “Prepare the horses,” the man continued, “I’ve got an old friend I should say hi to.”</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-4/chapter-6":"<p>When the news about what happened in Malikh Family’s ngajen ceremony arrived at Blackwood Family, Madam Blackwood was so enraged she broke the tea cup she held onto the floor. Establishing the family’s foot in Badril Village was supposed to be easy, but not only he failed to gain the support of Malikh Family and the villagers, the Young Master of Blackwood Family somehow managed to incite the bedridden patriarch’s supporters to regain their lost foothold against the corrupt Malikh Family’s elders.</p>\n<p>“There’s no point keeping him in that rural village,” Madam Blackwood said. She was a flamboyant, late thirty years old woman whose beauty was so superior that the previous viscount adopt her as a daughter. “Call Frane back to the city, he’s going to spend two months training in capital!”</p>\n<p>The butler who was waiting for her bowed and went away to carry out the task.</p>\n<p>“How’s Lyla’s birthday party going?”</p>\n<p>“Reply to madam, the party has started, the guests who came only from baron nobilities and mid-rank merchants,” a maid replied.</p>\n<p>The madam glanced the timid middle-aged man who sat on the same table as her. She scoffed, saying, “Look how your daughter made a name for herself. Not only the bribe money was wasted away, she coming on trips in the seminars only resulting her made a fool out of herself! Hah, like father, like daughter! Imbecile!”</p>\n<p>Madam Blackwood hurled the new cup that recently poured with hot, scalding tea. She purposely aimed at the table so the hot water splashed on the viscount’s hands. The timid viscount didn’t make a sound when his hands getting burnt, he didn’t dare to fight against his wife. It was already ten years too late for him to retaliate in any way. From the way he dragged his limping leg to fetch damp towel for his scaling skin, it was clear the waiting servants already used to ignore him.</p>\n<p>Recently, his wife’s mood had became the worst ever since their youngest daughter came back from the two years seminars. Unlike Frane--who only registered as his son by blood in papers, Lyla hadn’t show any particular talents in becoming a Class worthy of a noble family. She had a decent progress speed, a Level 7 Novice after seminars, but that progress mainly because she never had the interest to train herself. Madam Blackwood had bribed the officials so Lyla could enter the seminars supposed to boost her standing in high society, so she could catch higher ranking nobles eyes somehow. However, that plan failed in the worst way that could happen to a noble family like the Blackwood. She made blunders and broke rules so many times that she became a laughing stock. The only families that interested in her only lower rank nobles and not-so well off merchant families.</p>\n<p>“There also no point keeping that useless girl forever in the mansion,” Madam Blackwood said. “Send her to Badril Village by tomorrow. Make some smart men tending to her needs--they have to smart enough to know how to reel those Malikh villagers to say yes when I send my words in the future!”</p>\n<p>After the son’s failure, the madam would send her daughter, to do nothing but play around in Malikh Family. Even if there was something the girl could do, the madam surely wouldn’t choose this daughter of hers who she deemed too brainless to do even the simplest tasks. Her daughter was just that useless to her. The one with received the orders were people who accompanied her, who had experience in bribing and coercing. They were tasked to devour Malikh Family from the inside. The Blackwood would surely corner Bhela Malikh this time.</p>\n<p>Somewhere else, in a colorless courtyard, a birthday party already went on for about two hours. Most guests already leaving, not unlike the year before the two-years seminars happened when the sons of noble families dallying around waiting for a chance to talk with the young lady. Today, the Young Lady of Blackwood Family turned fourteen, two years before she would considered mature, but this young miss still pouting her mouth like a little girl.</p>\n<p>The old handmaid saw her young lady was bored and offered a treat.</p>\n<p>“Young lady, try this cake. A certain famous bakery made this just for your birthday.”</p>\n<p>The cake served on a small plate along with a silver fork. The girl took only mere seconds to finish it.</p>\n<p>“Is it good?” the handmaid asked.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t matter if it’s good or not, Aunt Jiji, I still hungry with this tiny minny bit of cake! Let me eat that one!” the girl pointed at the layered cake served on the center of the party.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Lyla, you can’t!”</p>\n<p>“Why can’t I?!”</p>\n<p>“You must present yourself as a proper young lady, so you can’t!”</p>\n<p>The cake was to be portioned to serve for the same amount of guests since the last party, but because the Blackwood Family’s young lady had a bad reputation in the seminars, most invited families didn’t actually come.</p>\n<p>“But I can’t be a lady if I’m hungry, am I?”</p>\n<p>“You must learn the way. Be patient, Young Lady Lyla!”</p>\n<p>“But I am huuungriiiiieeeehhh!!!”</p>\n<p>Aunt Jiji was terrified when she realized the young lady wasn’t referred only to portion of the cake, but she wanted to eat the whole cake. This shorty girl, although her feature was thin with only her cheeks got plump, actually had a talent to be a terrifying glutton that would be seen in Tiramikal Continent every one hundred years. It was a useless talent that brought only shame to Blackwood Family.</p>\n<p>It was fortunate that before the young lady could make a big ruckus, a maidservant came to bring the news about the madam’s decision. Aunt Jiji passed it to the young lady immediately.</p>\n<p>“You heard that, young lady! Madam is going to send you for a vacation!”</p>\n<p>Lyla’s head straightened, she forgot to pout. “Vacation? Where? Where where?”</p>\n<p>“To Badril Village!”</p>\n<p>“Badril Village?” the girl tilted her head. “Where’s that?”</p>\n<p>“If you promise Aunt Jiji not to eat too much cake today, Aunt Jiji will tell you where it is…”</p>\n<p>“I will if it turned out somewhere fun!”</p>\n<p>“Badril Village is where Young Lady Bhela’s home place!”</p>\n<p>“Sis Bhela’s home?!” Lyla gasped, “yahoooo!!!”</p>\n<p>Ignoring that she was the center of attention, Lyla suddenly jumped and danced like no tomorrow. Aunt Jiji tried to stop her, but it was futile since Lyla only promised not to be glutton. The remaining guests began whispering with each other. They were people who doubted the rumors about this Young Lady Blackwood, but after seeing how childish and ridiculous the girl danced, people were finally convinced. How was this a viscount’s daughter supposed to act? The girl danced her hips and hopped around like a bunny that had an itchy bum. Soon, the Young Lady Lyla Blackwood fell to the bottom list of desired young ladies to marry. Her reputation fell from not-so-smart, to stupid, and then fell again to brainless and imbecile. People didn’t see her in a good light. But that just how a girl named Lyla Blackwood really was.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Yashura Family got a peculiar visitor these past two days. He introduced himself as an expert from overseas, and somehow this foreign expert became interested in Shira Yashura. When the story leaked by insiders from Yashura Family, people were scratching their heads, wondering what could an educated man saw from this trash who could only get himself to level 3 Novice. Some people even sneered, saying that whole news was just Yashura Family’s little trick to clear up rumors from their heir’s name.</p>\n<p>“You understand, kiddo? There are three mandatory rules if someone wants to meet privately with me. First rule, it’s a <em>she</em>, not <em>he</em>. Second rule, big boobs. Third rule, in her lower part, there must be big bubbly butts, as big as her boobs. <em>Anything</em> lesser than that you can just send them back to wherever they came from.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit said that as he moved his chess piece, eating one of Shira’s pawns.</p>\n<p>“And remember, my standard is pretty high. Consult with how loadful those girls from Big-Boobed Sect are for more information,” the Nalaq continued.</p>\n<p>“Please don’t talk nonsense. I’m being serious here,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“Ey, I’m not talking nonsense. The girls from Big-Boobed Sect are real deal, okay? They’re huge! If you don’t believe me then you should go to Elzhier Family one of these days, go check out how glorious their boobs are. They always dance or become the maidservants when they’re not on duties.”</p>\n<p>“Ol’ Good-Natured Spirit… I don’t want to hear this imaginary all-woman sect of yours. Elzhier Family is only a normal rural family, they don’t host any sect members within their walls. If they did, the Village Head would boast about it at my uncle’s face every single day.”</p>\n<p>“You just don’t believe it because you never see how great they are--their boobs, I mean. How great those melons inside tight suits are! Just think about it; leather suits and melons--two entirely different things but if they come together they’d jiggling in harmony. This Good-Natured Spirit approved their sense of style.”</p>\n<p>“Forget about it, it’s not important--”</p>\n<p>“Boobs are important, ey!”</p>\n<p>Shira waved his hand as he didn’t want to continue this nonsense. He then moved a piece and finished his turn. He returned the topic back again, “The expert said he came from a first-tier faction called Blue Robe Society. If we can get his faction’s recognition then at least my family can silence all those rumors about me--especially the recent ones, they really are becoming a pain in the ass.”</p>\n<p>“I told you. I don’t talk with guys. No boobs, no good. Period.”</p>\n<p>“You are really becoming a pain in the ass,” Shira complained.</p>\n<p>After Shira said that, Good-Natured Spirit’s knight jumped over a wall of pawns to get on his bishop. Within a single breath Shira immediately moved his rook, creating a chain reaction that exposes the Nalaq’s defence, resulting his king trapped in three different direction.</p>\n<p>“Check mate.”</p>\n<p>“Ey, what the fu--” Good-Natured Spirit rage quit, flipping the chess board. “Hah! I knew it! You brat, you intentionally make me talk about boobs in order to lower my guard, right?! Fuck! That is how it is, isn’t it?!”</p>\n<p>“No, it is not.”</p>\n<p>“You sneaky bastard. You really got me,” Good-Natured Spirit threw his hands up in the air. <br>\n“Man, I surrender, that is some sick psychological tactic you got there.”</p>\n<p>“Now I don’t really know what you’re talking about.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit waved his hands in surrender, then he lit a cigarette. “Anyway, what do you want from me this time? Money again? I prepared some kobe coins enough for you to buy some candy, here, take this.”</p>\n<p>Shira shoved back the coin bag. “Not today. I just want you to meet Sir Baront Staterwind.”</p>\n<p>“No boobs, no good. Ask something else. How about I tell you the secret place where are those Big-Boobed Sect girls take their bath, ‘ey? Seems fair deal to me.”</p>\n<p>“How many times do I have to tell you--”</p>\n<p>“Sssshhh!!” Good-Natured Spirit hushed the boy. He then whispered, “you hear that?”</p>\n<p>Because the Nalaq suddenly became vigilant, Shira instinctively lowered his voice too. “Hear what?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“I heard some rats watching us…” the Nalaq covered his mouth, as if he didn’t want people to read lips what he said next, “some big-boobed rats…”</p>\n<p>“Huh… what?”</p>\n<p>“The girls from Big-Boobed Sect… they’re here…”</p>\n<p>“The heck are you talking about? This hill is Yashura Family’s property--”</p>\n<p>“Sssshhhh! They’ve noticed me noticing them. Wait here, I’mma get you some melons for your reward!”</p>\n<p>After he saying that, Good-Natured Spirit’s figure melting into the thin air.</p>\n<p>Shira Yashura sighed. At times, asking favor to this vulgar Nalaq not only difficult, it also unpredictable he’d only incite troubles if he not careful.</p>\n<p>After his winning streak for more than half a year maybe he became cocky. He forgot the Nalaq wasn’t there to solve his problem whenever he wanted, although the Nalaq sort of ended up like that after a few months he came here. Shira got some thinking, maybe he should stop seeing this Nalaq as his convenient piggy bank for his own good.</p>\n<p>“Really, he always making a mess for me to clean. I wonder if such thoughtless Nalaqs like him are common around here… now, where’s the last piece again?” he sighed for the second time.</p>\n<p>When he was picking up chess pieces that board Good-Natured Spirit flipped earlier, Shira realized there was a missing piece. Turned out it was stuck in the hole between tree roots.</p>\n<p>He plunged his hand to look for the missing chess piece.</p>\n<p>“Ugh… my fingers can’t reach.”</p>\n<p>He tried to squirm his body to fit his hand in.</p>\n<p>“Where is it again?”</p>\n<p>He frowned. He squirmed his body again really hard.</p>\n<p>“Oh, there it--”</p>\n<p><em>BOOOOOMMMMM!!!!</em></p>\n<p>An explosion happened not far away from the place he used to hang out, creating a wave of rolling dust that swept over the hill. Shira got his hand stuck between the tree rots, he could only hugged his head with his free hand and waited for the shockwave to finish. The chess pieces he gathered already nowhere to be found. He cooked up his head, looking left and right, and saw the greeny grasses were covered with dirts and trees were uprooted. The whole hill became a shithole kind of mess.</p>\n<p>Before the boy could swallow what was going on, a chuckle could be heard near him. Before him, Good-Natured Spirit emerged, coiling around the Nalaq’s body were purple-colored living flames that hungrily tried to eat him whole.</p>\n<p>As carefree as he usually was, Good-Natured Spirit said with a grin, “Those Big-Boobed Sect girls sure are feisty. They’re escaping too fast, I can’t get you melons. I managed to get a feeling of their butts, though. Here, there’s some fragrant left behind.”</p>\n<p>Shira stepped back when the Nalaq offered his palm. It was still on fire, the boy didn’t want to get burn along with him. Besides, he didn’t want to get involved with the Nalaq’s deprived hobby.</p>\n<p>“Sure you don’t want it?” Good-Natured Spirit took a last sniff from his palm, followed by a low chuckle of his.</p>\n<p>“Good-Natured Spirit… what’s that fire?”</p>\n<p>“Yeah? Dunno, man. Exorcism flame or something.”</p>\n<p>“Ohh… oh, it’s very nice to know you up until know. Good bye.”</p>\n<p>“Hmm? You want to go somewhere?” Realizing the purple flame was getting annoying, Good-Natured Spirit then patted away the coiling flame from his shoulders like it was nothing.</p>\n<p>Shira shrugged his shoulders. It seemed this bastard Nalaq was too tough for that exorcism flame. Maybe the flame was too ordinary? Whatever, he didn’t care about that anymore. His eyes then swept the ruin around him. He said, “You can’t forget about the meeting for today. But please clean the mess you made yourself.”</p>\n<p>“That’s what you want for the chess reward?”</p>\n<p>Shira nodded.</p>\n<p>“Aye, aye, will do.” Good-Natured Spirit flicked his fingers, and human-sized paper cranes came out of thin air. They were obedient, not clear whether were monsters or just magical devices. The paper cranes used magnet-like magic to carry the messy uprooted trees and boulders, along with sweeping the dirt from the grass. The cleaning up might take a while, since the hill really was a mess. Shira, feeling a little light on the head, facepalming as he returned back to Yashura Family.</p>\n<p>The whole explosion could be heard from all over Badril Village. It wasn’t clear what its cause, but Yashura Family sent guards to prevent people from knowing what really happened. In Yashura Family’s guest hall, Patriarch Shuro Yashura, a few good Yashura Family elders, and the respected visitor, Sir Baront Staterwind, forming a circle as they sat cross-legged, discussing the explosion that had just occurred.</p>\n<p>“Good elders, Sir Patriarch Yashura, I know you must get excited when I said Young Master Shira has some talent in communicating with Nalaqs. However, a Nalaq still a Nalaq. You must not offend a Nalaq whatsoever, or the consequence is dire! Young Master Shira’s life is way more important than getting a qualification to enter my school!” Sir Baront Staterwind warned. His forehead was still wet with sweat, since he hurriedly ran to Yashura Family when he realized the direction of recent explosion.</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, you’re right, Sir Staterwind. Absolutely right! I already sent someone to check on my nephew’s condition, please calm down,” Patriarch Shuro said.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront shook his head. “You don’t really know what I’m trying to say, do you? You should prepare a very good healer or a doctor, Patriarch Shuro, because if it isn’t death, one can easily lose a limb over angering a Nalaq! That happens more often than you think!”</p>\n<p>The elders drew cold breaths in unison when they heard that. Patriarch Shuro, whose face already pale, becoming even whiter than a sheet of paper. If they boy lost a limb, Shira’s chance to succeed him as the next patriarch could be swept away like specks of dust.</p>\n<p>Yulong the Butler arrived. Everyone in the room had been anxiously waiting for him they instinctively stood up when Yulong approached.</p>\n<p>“Yulong, how’s Shira doing?” Patriarch Shuro asked.</p>\n<p>Yulong replied, “Young Master Shira is back, patriarch. But Madam Yashura sent him to the kitchen for a second breakfast.”</p>\n<p>“Breakfast? What’s a breakfast has something to do with that explosion? Can he still walk?”</p>\n<p>“He’s walking fine, Patriarch Yashura.”</p>\n<p>“Then, Yulong, please go fetch my nephew for me, we have something urgent to tell him!”</p>\n<p>After his trained elegant bow, Yulong stepped back and proceeded to do the task given to him.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront Staterwind peered at the butler’s back. He traveled southern lands many times, visiting many villages, yet, he seldom heard a Mossack descent major family employed western-style butler. What made him confused even more that Sir Kurusiya apparently knew the butler and gave his respect to him, which Sir Baront Staterwind didn’t expect that coming from the cold eastern Kaya swordsman.</p>\n<p>“Dear good elder,” Sir Baront Staterwind asked a random elder who sat beside him, “may I know why there’s a butler working here?”</p>\n<p>“Is Sir referring to Yulong? Yulong isn’t actually working for Yashura Family, but Young Master Shira’s mother’s attendant. I can’t tell you the details, so forgive me sir, all I can say is Young Master Shira’s father is exceedingly brave and awesome he managed to woo a respectable lady many years ago.”</p>\n<p>“Ahhh…” Sir Baront nodded. The boy apparently a result of his parent eloping. The Blue Robe Society expert of course knew etiquette to hold himself from digging the story further.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, Yulong came back with Shira followed behind. The boy wore new clothes since his previous one was dirty. When he saw the group of elders and the expert guest looking at him, Shira sighed inside his heart. He knew he had to clean Good-Natured Spirit’s mess once again.</p>\n<p>“Greetings, elders… greetings, uncle patriarch… greetings, Sir Staterwind…”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro impatiently treading forward. “Shira my boy, is it true that you lost your limbs?”</p>\n<p>“I’m unhurt, uncle, see?” Shira waved both of his hands to prove that his limbs still functioned as they should be.</p>\n<p>“Oh! God, thank God! Really! These are really your hands, aren’t they? Not a fake one made with wood?” Patriarch Shuro Yashura grabbed his nephew hands and waved it around like a child playing with flags.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira,” Sir Baront opened his mouth, “I reckon you failed to ask the Nalaq to meet me? If you can’t do it, young master, it best for you not to push him any further. Today, you offend him and he blast the hill behind your Yashura Family as a warning, but what happens if you make the same mistake tomorrow?”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro nodded at his words vigorously. “Sir Baront is right, Shira my boy. A Nalaq is a revered being ancient Mossacks worshiped as their guardian angel. The consequence of making them mad is very dire! You should know better, my boy, you should’ve told your uncle if a Nalaq came to you the first time!”</p>\n<p>Sir Baront and his uncle Patriarch Shuro had good intentions in telling him about how to be respectful to a Nalaq. But the more Shira heard their warning, the more he doubted about Good-Natured Spirit being a “revered” Nalaq like they said. Of course, saying the truth about the explosion’s true cause resulting only Yashura Family losing face in front of Sir Baront Staterwind. Shira had no choice, he had to tread the matter very carefully.</p>\n<p>“<em>Cough, cough</em>… Uncle, Sir Baront, thank you for your concern. Truth is, it wasn’t that the Nalaq being mad that causes the explosion, but there was some… accident… that happened right before.”</p>\n<p>“With what title do you usually call him, Young Master Shira?” Sir Baront asked.</p>\n<p>“As far as I know, he doesn’t have a title. At least he didn’t tell me if he ever had one. He told me to call him ‘Good-Natured Spirit’.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, with that kind of nickname, he must be a very benevolent person when he was alive,” Sir Baront concluded as he rubbed his beard. “So, Young Master Shira, it seems he didn’t really intent to blast into smithereens.”</p>\n<p>Shira nodded. That part was true. Instead, someone else happened to be intending to blast this Nalaq into smithereens.</p>\n<p>“Thank God! Thank God! If he is a good Nalaq, maybe we don’t need to throw the second ngajen ceremony for this month, after all!” Patriarch Shuro Yashura exclaimed. The elders in the guest hall followed his exclaiming by handclapping and joyful cries. Ngajen ceremony only held once a month so the village safe from angry Selaqs, no one ever tried it to protect themselves from intelligent Nalaqs. Since the village was founded, the locals never had a Nalaq dwelling there. So it was natural for the elders to worry about throwing a ceremony they didn’t know working or not. Ngajen ceremony was expensive, after all.</p>\n<p>The more Shira saw how the previous tense hall turned jubilant and full of relieved faces, the more awkward he became. That Nalaq might call himself ‘Good-Natured Spirit’, yet he was anything but good. A low-life spirit who no doubt had been using the invisibility traits of spirits to commit many deprived crimes. He was closer to evil spirit incarnation than a good-natured one. The misunderstanding was too great his face twisted as if he’d just taste a sour lemon.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront Staterwind said, “Still, since he seems reluctant to use his old name, I reckon the Nalaq that approaching you is a low-tier one, Young Master Shira. Low-tier Nalaqs usually spirits that gain consciousness merely by luck. They don’t have factions backing them, and fortunately--in my experience--it easier to initiate negotiation with unaffiliated Nalaqs.” A hint of pride then flashed through his eyes, he continued, “my disciples will arrive tomorrow morning. One of them contracted with a high-tier Nalaq. Since the Nalaq’s mood turned sour is partly my fault, with help from the Nalaq contracted with one of my disciples, I will ask him to leave Yashura Family peacefully!”</p>\n<p>“Sir Staterwind is wise! Thank you for your concern, Sir!” Patriarch Shuro sang praises toward this expert. The elders of Yashura Family followed suit.</p>\n<p>“As expected of such expert!”</p>\n<p>“Sir Staterwind is the best of bunch of all experts that I know all my life!”</p>\n<p>“Hurray for Sir Staterwind!”</p>\n<p>They circling Sir Baront Staterwind and, not long after that, someone started to prostate. They behaved as if the guest was their one and only savior. Even Shira was getting embarrassed from seeing the scene, not to mention the already flushing Baront Staterwind.</p>\n<p>When everyone getting carried away, Shira slipped out after excusing himself. He knew he was no match for the Yashura Family’s older generations’ shamelessness. Upon walking outside, he saw Yulong was standing by the hall’s door looking galant as usual with his butler professionalism.</p>\n<p>“Can you please try to stop my uncle, Yulong? Sir Staterwind is started to get uncomfortable there.”</p>\n<p>Yulong glanced at the whole mess inside, and then he said to his young master, “I think it’s not everyday an expert coming to Yashura Family, young master, so let’s count this as Patriarch Yashura to gaining favors from a foreign expert.”</p>\n<p>“Are they really okay, though?”</p>\n<p>Yulong smiled.</p>\n<p>“Of course they aren’t, young master. But Patriarch Shuro and the family elders are honest people. Although sometimes they can be overwhelming, I’m sure Sir Staterwind can see no falsehood in their words.”</p>\n<p>Shira looked at those elders inside once again. The more he saw, the more he realized that those hysterical village men calling a man they barely knew these past two days a savior by no means a lie from their part. The elders really were freaking out when they heard the explosion. And Patriarch Shuro Yashura was the most worried of the bunch, considering him a patriarch and an uncle. Thinking about it all again, Shira couldn’t really say he still embarrassed seeing the elders spewing exaggerated flattering with straight faces.</p>\n<p>“Sir Staterwind comes from a respectable sect. Someone like that won’t get to travel the southern lands if he didn’t know the nature of the local people. So it best not to worry about it too much, young master,” Yulong said.</p>\n<p>“Really… ah, speaking of sects,” Shira deliberately changed the topic, “I heard from someone that one of the major families in Badril Village hosts members of a certain sect in secret. You’re from outside, Yulong--do you think something so outrageous like that could happen?”</p>\n<p>“Some older sects have long reaching influence, but I don’t think anyone would be interested to plant their own in Badril Village. There’s nothing valuable here for them to take notice.”</p>\n<p>“As I thought. It’s just unthinkable to think some secret powers lurking beneath our everyday lives. What if some experts actually pretending to be servants here in Yashura Family?”</p>\n<p>Although it wasn’t noticeable, Yulong’s smile became stiff.</p>\n<p>“You jest, young master. If that was true, do you think your uncle and the elders can take that kind of truth?”</p>\n<p>Following Yulong’s gaze, Shira peeped the hall and saw Sir Baront’s awkward figure, where he was in the center of Yashura Family elites--all of them-- who passionately prostrating in the floor. They practically worshipping him now.</p>\n<p>“You’re right…” Shira could only hide his face with his palm. Just when he thought he could understand them, the boy then wished he didn’t know these shameless men.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>As far as the current generation of Badril Village locals knew, they never got visited by nobles until this month Malikh Family’s ngajen ceremony happened. Everyone still talking about it.</p>\n<p>Young Master of Blackwood Family only stayed in Badril Village in one day. And the noble carriage of Blackwood Family set off out of Badril Village by noon. The next morning after the day he was gone, the two foreign guests who had been staying in Malikh Family, Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia, felt overstaying might be unnecessary, thus decided to leave too.</p>\n<p>Because the carriages going out from Badril Village mostly for public transports, Bhela personally asked an elder from his father’s faction who had a horse carriage to give her guests a ride to the nearest town, where they’d later book a private carriage for them to return home. Mister Harrington, as an unsocial bachelor as he always was, was waiting in the carriage for Madame Sylvia to say her parting words to Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>“You have a very bright future, Young Lady Bhela. A girl with limitless potential. So your favor will become very valuable as you mature,” Madame Sylvia said. “If you need something, you can always send letters to my sect. Don’t hold back. Just think about this of us making an investment.”</p>\n<p>Since Bhela a smart girl anyway, Madame Sylvia decided not to make her words fancy and told her in a straightforward manner. Bhela appreciated her honesty, and said her thanks.</p>\n<p>The carriage then set off. In the main gate of Badril Village, the guards on duty witnessed the recently blazing popular Young Lady Bhela Malikh bowing her body as she sent off two foreigners in traveling clothes made from expensive linen.</p>\n<p>“Look at how she is,” inside the carriage, Madame Sylvia said to Mister Harrington. “She’s a pretty sensible girl, don’t you think?”</p>\n<p>“She is,” Mister Harrington said softly, almost a murmur.</p>\n<p>It was hard to start a conversation whenever Mister Harrington sat with his arms crossed tightly. Madame Sylvia could see that he wasn’t exactly happy with the outcome regarding Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>There was no bandits lurking around, and no monsters occasionally came out, proved that the lands around Badril Village actually well-protected--too well, perhaps, for a rural village without a major power backing them. Their journey was smooth without disturbance. Thirty minutes after they left Badril Village, they encountered another carriage painted with black-jet color. The black carriage was well-decorated with golden-colored plates, obviously elites or nobles were traveling inside.</p>\n<p>However, unlike common nobles who liked to hide in the carriage to show-off their elegance and aloofness, this carriage simply out of commonsense. To talk about how weird this carriage was there was a need to point out the refreshing greenness of the view around. Despite there being a road far away from settlement, hint of liveliness from bird chirping--along with croaking frogs from nearby streams and singing insects--completed the idyllic road with a strange harmony that invited light-hearted person to sing along with lively nature. That was exactly what the noble in the black carriage doing. A young lady with a very girly and childish feature was carefreely sitting in the window in spite of pale servants begging her to sit still. She completely dumb about the servants’ pleas. And with her personality, nobody knew whether she was pretending or not. The only thing that the jubilant Lyla Blackwood cared about was singing an off-tune song about her befriending village frogs and bunnies.</p>\n<p>“Prepare your life you frogs and bunnies~</p>\n<p>Cause I’m not letting you go before we become the best of buddies~~</p>\n<p>Wait for me you birdies and kitties~~</p>\n<p>Cause we’re about to become the best of all buddies~~ yuhuu~ yuhuu~~</p>\n<p>The best buddies in this lifetime~~ yuhuuuu~~~”</p>\n<p>There was nothing the servants and the guards could do to stop their young lady from singing this amazingly ugly song about her future exploits in Badril Village. Seeing that another carriage approaching, the horse-riding guards did their best to block the view to the crest planted on the carriage’s compartment. Their effort to save faces from the young lady’s mishap was futile, however, since the other party happened to know Lyla.</p>\n<p>“How many times have I told you to stay away from windows, Lyla!”</p>\n<p>“Whu--what? Who?” Lyla was surprised. But then she was elated to see a familiar face. “Is that you, Instructor Sylvia? You here to train Sis Bhela’s archery again?”</p>\n<p>“Get down from the window!” Madame Sylvia raised her voice.</p>\n<p>“I’m also here to meet Sis Bhela!” Lyla also raised her voice cheerfully.</p>\n<p>“Lyla, you won’t be able to get married in the future if you’re always act like this!” Madame Sylvia warned her. She long dropped title of Young Lady Blackwood when talking to this naughty girl.</p>\n<p>“Um!” Lyla nodded. “But which one do you like more, Instructor Sylvia, bunnies or kitties?” It was no use trying to talk sense to Lyla. Any warning only come to her right ear and gone out straight from the left one.</p>\n<p>“Stay away from the windows!!!” Madame Sylvia screamed until her voice shrilled.</p>\n<p>Lyla also screamed, “Good morning to you too!!!”</p>\n<p>Both carriages drifted apart after the brief encounter. It ended with Lyla happily waved her hands happily. Madame Sylvia sighed and shook her head. That girl was so naughty that the troubles she created made the seminars’ managements even considered to drop her once during the seminars. Only after Bhela Malikh convinced them she’d take care of Lyla they finally did let go the matter.</p>\n<p>Before, the black carriage of Blackwood Family came to Badril Village in the shroud of night’s darkness, so nobody noticed their elegance and the aura of expensive carriage blazing through the village road--of which was surprisingly wide for a settlement road, unlike road of cities in the western kingdoms, because long ago Mossack people needed to endure monster stampedes passing through their villages once every few months.</p>\n<p>“Mom, look, is that a noble?” a snotty kid pointing out the carriage.</p>\n<p>The mother hurriedly pulled her child. “Ssuuussh! Keep your finger to yourself! Don’t you know what happened to peasants that make noble angry from the stories they always talking about?”</p>\n<p>The steel-armored guards who escort the carriage scoffed them in disdain. Contrast with the escorts’ attitudes, Lyla waved her hand at them, while shouting, “Hey boy, don’t you think bunnies are cute as the kitties? Or do you like cats more?”</p>\n<p>The kid didn’t answer. He instead forced to bow by her mother and let the carriage went through silently. The villagers didn’t have the experience in receiving nobles, most of them--except for those who attended the ngajen ceremony in Malikh Family--had never saw nobles in their lives. Because of that they were awkward and didn’t know what to do.</p>\n<p>Lyla didn’t seem to mind their stiffness. Instead, she vigorously greeted everyone she saw from the window she sat on.</p>\n<p>“Good day! Good morning! I’m here to sleepover at Sis Bhela’s place! Do you know where Sis Bhela lives?”</p>\n<p>Back in Elzhier Family, in the main family’s house, their patriarch, hurriedly changed his clothes to a formal one he always used every ngajen ceremony.</p>\n<p>“Hurry, hurry! As the head of this village, how can I let a noble arriving without me receiving them?!”</p>\n<p>Not even he yet buttoned his shirt properly, the Village Head sprinted toward the main street, only to see the crowd of onlookers already dispersed and still talking about the scary nobles they always heard in stories were actually <em>weirdly</em> friendly.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Bhela Malikh was already notified about Lyla Blackwood’s arrival. She waited on a chair at the Malikh Family’s gate, drinking a fresh young coconut water occasionally. The black carriage finally was in her view. And the young girl she was waiting for happily waved her hand at her. From the window.</p>\n<p>“Carefull, Lyla!” Bhela yelled as she sprang from her chair.</p>\n<p>“Huuupp!” Lyla Blackwood simply didn’t want to waste anytime leaving the carriage through the door. So she simply jumped from the window she sat upon, before the carriage even stopped. It was fortunate that amongst Bhela’s skill as a Unique Class, she had <b>Haste</b>, which boosted her speed in short duration. She used that to catch Lyla before she hurt herself. The young noble girl landed splendidly in Bhela’s arm.</p>\n<p>“What’s this, Sistah?” Lyla’s eyes sparkled when she saw Bhela get a young coconut in her other hand. She was completely oblivious she just did something dangerous.</p>\n<p>“Young coconut. There’s still some of its water left. Here, try this,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“For me? Really?”</p>\n<p>“Drink slowly…”</p>\n<p><em>Glug glug glug</em>. Lyla drank the coconut in anything but in slowly manner. She even burped shamelessly.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Lyla, ah!” the butler who coming with her was in horror seeing how Young Lady Lyla Blackwood made a horrible mess by spilling the coconut water on her expensive, silk woven black dress. Only an equally expensive silk handkerchief worthy enough to wipe his young lady’s noble dress!</p>\n<p>“I told you to drink slowly…” Bhela said. She used her sleeve to wipe Lyla’s wet face, and then proceeded to also wipe Lyla’s dress.</p>\n<p>“Y-young miss!” the butler shouted in panic. His body jolted as soon as he saw the outrageous act of spoiling the young noble’s dress by making it contacted with commoner clothes. That was heresy! He needed her to stop before she contained Blackwood’s expensive dress with her commoner’s bacteria!</p>\n<p>“You need something?” Bhela looked at this unfamiliar butler of Blackwood Family. Her expressionless face judged the butler coldly.</p>\n<p>“My name is Tim, young miss--please use this!” the butler offered a silky smooth handkerchief with Blackwood Family’s crest embroidered on the surface. The handkerchief was actually the butler’s, was awarded to his great-great-great grandfather by the then Baron Blackwood for some sort of achievement that practically nobody was still alive to remember. Everytime Butler Tim met a new person, he’d make an excuse to show off this particular handkerchief. Today was no exception. It was his most precious handkerchief. Just from the look of it one could tell how crazy expensive it was.</p>\n<p>“Ah, ah… my nose… aahhh--” Lyla felt her nose was wet and itchy, “--ahhtchii!!!”</p>\n<p>“You’ve got a flu?” Bhela asked worriedly.</p>\n<p>“Yeah. Aunt Jiji told me to drink my medicine everyday but it’s so bitter. So much bitter that it’s evil!”</p>\n<p>“Where’s your medicine now?”</p>\n<p>“Oh. I throw it away last night.”</p>\n<p>Bhela shook her head.</p>\n<p>“That’s no good. You can’t throw away your medicine like that. Now, wipe your nose. This mister butler said to use this…” she put the handkerchief on Lyla’s nose, and Lyla blew her nose on it.</p>\n<p>Lyla gave back the handkerchief to Butler Tim. “Thank you, Sir Butler. It’s very helpful of you.”</p>\n<p>The butler received back his most precious handkerchief. Bonus Lyla’s snot.</p>\n<p>“Come on inside,” Bhela said to Lyla. “Even if the water runs dry, coconuts still have meat we can scoop. After that we’ll pick some star fruits that I planted since I was a child.”</p>\n<p>“Star fruits! Woohooo!”</p>\n<p>The girls then walked inside. Lyla was so excited she didn’t leave her friend, hanging on her neck like a koala being comfortable on a tree branch. The stories about a noble young lady coming to Malikh Family for Bhela Malikh spread amongst the maidservants like oil being poured on an open wildfire. The Malikhs couldn’t describe the pride seeing their eldest young lady with a blue blood friend. Especially the aunties. They watched how close Bhela and Lyla with teary eyes and happy smiles.</p>\n<p>“Young lady is… finally… finally…”</p>\n<p>“She finally has a friend…”</p>\n<p>“Huuu… huuu… merciful Goddesses finally saw the young lady’s plight and blessed her with a real friend… huuu huuuu….”</p>\n<p>Nobody more happier than the aunties who were familiar with how their Young Lady Bhela lived her live. They silently cried watching their young lady, who usually alone and unapproachable, finally grown up and had her first friend in these past ten years.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Butler Tim grimaced inside. Despite the fact that he was tasked to win over Bhela Malikh with any means necessary, he didn’t like this girl. It wasn’t because his handkerchief got dirty--well, maybe he resented her for it a little--it because the girl named Bhela Malikh wasn’t acting as a young country girl supposed to act. Country bumpkins supposed to falter when they saw the radiance seeped out of the nobles’ aura, they supposed to tremble when they saw the noble wealth glittering beneath the sun. But this girl was indifferent and aloof. She was cold but the coldness paired with concise and elegant mannerism. Butler Tim knew she trying to act noble herself. That was why he didn’t like her.</p>\n<p>However, Butler Tim was a smart person. Any smart person would wear a perfect smile despite his heart bleeding over the snot on his precious handkerchief. Before leaving the city, the butler didn’t forget to look for a gift he’d use to lower the Malikh Family’s guard. He heard the previous gift was rejected, and when he asked for the content of the gift, the smart Butler Tim shook his head as if he knew it would happen.</p>\n<p>Toward country bumpkins, too expensive gifts would never work. He knew this because he was smart. And because he was smart, he knew better gifts. Not-so-expensive gifts worked for country bumpkins.</p>\n<p>Therefore, he presented Bhela Malikh with popular city biscuits.</p>\n<p>“I heard this biscuit is currently very popular among noble young ladies. This butler happened to pass by a store that sold this, so I reckon Young Lady Bhela might love to taste some.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, because the elders roughly knew the Blackwood Family’s youngest lady would come to visit, two leaders of opposing factions came to watch how their Young Lady Bhela would receive the noble guest. Elder Jhamil was all smiling because he liked what he saw. But the expression of Elder Khasim turned sour when he saw how the butler of Blackwood Family tried to butter up to Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>“Don’t accept it, young lady, please….” Elder Khasim whispered under his breath. Of course, there was no single soul heard what he just said. He was worried the hard work to rebuild his faction’s morale all would turn into dust if people thought their spiritual mascot, the one and only Young Lady Bhela Malikh, could be bought with mere biscuits.</p>\n<p>Contrary to what Elder Khasim hoped, Bhela Malikh received the gift without even putting a second thought. A feeling of defeat surged inside him. Elder Jhamil looked at his rival with a mocking glance.</p>\n<p>After receiving the snacks, Bhela excused herself and brought Lyla with her to stroll around Malikh Family’s gardens. Butler Tim pretended to wave his hand and smiled, but inside, he was gloating at how hypocrite Bhela was. His guess that Young Lady Bhela wouldn’t refuse the gift he brought was entirely correct. Before, he deliberately said the biscuit was noble young ladies’ favorite. Thus, according to his smart logic, as long as it wasn’t too expensive that it’d scare this fake young lady, no way a noble wannabe would reject this kind of gifts.</p>\n<p>“Heh,” Butler Tim scoffed when Bhela and Lyla already left. “Bet you’ve never eaten any city biscuits your entire life, haven’t you.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, Bhela Malikh hadn’t had any city biscuits her entire life. Not before and also not today. What Butler Tim didn’t know was that the snacks he bought with his own money ultimately ended up returned to Blackwood Family--to be exact, it ended up inside Lyla Blackwood’s belly. Bhela couldn’t help but received the biscuits when, beside her, she saw Lyla was drooling looking at the biscuits.</p>\n<p>The elders led by Elder Jhamil then respectfully welcomed the butler along with servants and guards from Blackwood Family. From the impression alone, Butler Tim could see reasons for him to like this slick-tongued Elder Jhamil. He knew how to flatter and also he knew how to act humble in front of people with higher status than him. Not like that noble-wannabe Young Lady of Malikh Family. This Elder Jhamil knew that he was only a country bumpkin thus acted accordingly. Naturally, the smart Butler Tim was pleased.</p>\n<p>And so began Butler Tim’s quests to swallow Malikh Family with his smartly planned schemes and cunning political games.</p>\n<p>In mere hours, the neutral elders who hadn’t joined either both rivalling factions began flocking to Elder Jhamil’s side. One part because they wanted to side with the faction that had the noble support and another part simply because Elder Jhamil, with the help of Butler Tim, had been throwing around sweet deals over all directions.</p>\n<p>“Only one tenth of the elder council members don’t want to pick a side by now, but their number is too significant to be an obstacle for Sir Butler’s great plan,” Elder Jhamil reported the current situation to Butler Tim.</p>\n<p>The butler was enjoying a glass of tea served by the maid that supposed to serve Young Lady Lyla Blackwood as if he was the visiting noble himself. He nodded. “I see. With this, the first stage of my plan has been completed.”</p>\n<p>“Oohhh!” Elder Jhamil exclaimed. “Sir Butler summoned rain and fire by flipping Malikh Family’s political scene upside down, and this is only the first stage?! As expected, the Butler of Blackwood Family is very smart!”</p>\n<p>Butler Tim originally wanted to act aloof and sophisticated before he visited this rural village. However, upon being called a smart person, he couldn’t help but grinned widely. “Oho, you’re an interesting fella, aren’t you? Very well, since you’ve done a good job yourself, I won’t be so petty to grab all the credit. Tell me how I should do next, if I like what I hear, we might as well corporate your thoughts into my plan.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was excited. How could he not? An opportunity to rise beyond a mere elder of rural village was laid before him.</p>\n<p>“Sir Butler, you may not know this, but we Mossack people regard having a good meal very highly. Everytime we’re having breakfast or dinner together as the entire family, even though we’re always looked peaceful outside, those trivial events actually are a political battlefield for us elders to extend our influence! This lowly man himself used a few move in the past during breakfast to gather like-minded men under my banner. I used all my resources and connections in a single mealtime to attack my rivals! However, these past two days, my biggest rival used a lowly method against me…”</p>\n<p>“Oh? What did he do?” Butler Tim asked.</p>\n<p>“He didn’t do much,” Elder Jhamil said, sneering when he was talking about this rival of his, “all he did was inviting Young Lady Bhela everytime we were having a meal in the family hall. He’s been a stubborn and ignorant supporter of main family, but this time he actually knew how to use his connection with the main family to deal a blow against me. A few of the elders had been faltering when they saw Young Lady Bhela leaning over the other side; I’m afraid if we’re leaving this ignorant rival of me doing as he wanted, there’s gonna be a hole in Sir Butler’s smart plan!”</p>\n<p>Butler Tim swirled the tea in his cup as though he was deep in thought. Of course, if this proven to endanger his smart plan, the butler couldn’t sit still watching all that happened. “I heard the Mossacks are peculiar people, but I don’t know you Mossack people have a strange custom!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, we’re living here far away from the city, so of course our traditions might seem unsophisticated to wise westerners like Sir Butler,” Elder Jhamil fawned.</p>\n<p>“Then what do you suggest Blackwood Family should do in this situation, Elder Jhamil?”</p>\n<p>“It’s easy!” Elder Jhamil was so excited he almost jumped from his seat. “My rival faction used Young Lady Bhela to gain foothold, and we can also use that to deal a greater blow back to them!”</p>\n<p>“And that is?”</p>\n<p>“Of course, we can use--I mean, we can invite young noble miss to a dinner together with us. With this we can unofficially announce our alliance with Blackwood Family! It’s the final nail to main family’s faction!”</p>\n<p>Even though Bhela Malikh’s status as a Unique Class shone throughout all of Badril Village, her name still fall short with a pure noble like Lyla Blackwood. Madam back in Blackwood Family used her daughter so Blackwood could infiltrate Malikh Family easily, but that didn’t mean Lyla still wasn’t as useful.</p>\n<p>“Very well. Let us go with that,” then he asked the maid responsible for Lyla’s schedule. “What was Young Lady Lyla doing this afternoon?”</p>\n<p>The maid replied, “Young Lady Bhela Malikh carried her around to play. At first, they went to Malikh Family’s orchard to pick some fruits. Then they visited the sick Patriarch Malikh in his room for a few minutes. After that, they went outside to stroll and came back with a new rabbit pet they bought from other family. Finally, when the sun is setting, they went to the kitchen to watch the servants cooking.”</p>\n<p>“How uncouth for a noble young lady being led around in dirty places like that,” Butler Tim was displeased, but nothing he could do since making Bhela’s attention elsewhere meant he could move freely to make a trap for her. Nodding to himself, the butler then gave an instruction to the maid, “you go to Young Lady Lyla and tell that Malikh Family invite her for a dinner.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was excitedly rubbing his hands when Butler Tim said that. Finally, payback to those imbecile Elder Khasim!</p>\n<p>“But, Butler Tim…” the maid hesitated.</p>\n<p>“What is it?”</p>\n<p>“Malikh Family already invited Young Lady Lyla to have dinner. She’s eating in Malikh Family’s hall right now….”</p>\n<p>“Hmm, what do you mean?”</p>\n<p>What the maid meant was that someone in Malikh Family already brought Lyla to have dinner with them.</p>\n<p>When Butler Tim playing political games and scheming around in Malikh Family, Bhela Malikh, along with the elders friendly with Elder Khasim, had been giving bunch of candies and food for Lyla Blackwood, much more than the biscuits Butler Tim brought with him. Being a great foodie herself, Lyla never had enough, the first day in Malikh Family she ate more sweets and foods worth of one week back in Blackwood Family’s manor. Aunt Jiji and other Blackwood Family’s maid servants would freak out if they saw how glutton Lyla currently was.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the news that the main family’s faction hosting a dinner for a noble miss swept Malikh Family like a thunderstorm. The neutral elders Elder Jhamil had just bought flocking back toward Elder Khasim’s side. It was so sudden. Everyone wasn’t even got a breath to process what had happened. And this for sure was an unprecedented move ever since Patriarch Ghalim suddenly fell ill and retreated from the political scene.</p>\n<p>Just as one side was busy completing the first stage to win over the Young Lady of Malikh Family, the other side already won over Young Lady of the noble Blackwood Family. All happened in a span of a single day.</p>\n<p>“Y-young Lady Lyla…”</p>\n<p>Even Butler Tim couldn’t pull his own young miss seeing how happy she was. His plan had been jabbed in a completely unexpected way. Maybe he wasn’t so smart after all.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>It was unfortunate that Madam Malikh didn’t see the Young Noble Miss of Blackwood Family kindly. Even though the girl did nothing wrong, Madam Malikh wasn’t so muddled that she wasn’t aware what Blackwood Family and those corrupt elders conspiring against her husband and Malikh’s main family. Even Bhela herself couldn’t do anything to change her mother’s mind.</p>\n<p>However, Lyla Blackwood, an airhead as she always was, was oblivious of the hostility directed toward her.</p>\n<p>It was morning the second day Lyla in Badril Village. Following her friend Bhela, she carried a little box inside Patriarch Ghalim’s bedroom. This little box filled with custom-made medicines--most were amateurly mixed from two different trivial medicines, consisted of remedies for flu and headache. Nothing harmful but nothing useful at the same time. And just like yesterday, to pay for Bhela parents’ kindness for letting her staying in Malikh Family, Lyla Blackwood decided to play doctor a little bit.</p>\n<p>“Uncle, I’m coming again to help you feel better,” Lyla said as she dragged a chair and sat beside Patriarch Ghalim’s sick bed. Seeing the pale middle-aged man in bed, she blinked her googly eyes, then continued, “how’s yesterday medicine I gave you. Are you feeling a tiny minny bit better, perhaps?”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim certainly was feeling better these past few days, not because Lyla’s medicines, but Grandpa Piss’s diagnosis and remedies. Toward this girl, he weakly nodded. “Thank you for your help, little lady.”</p>\n<p>“Then I’m going to fed you my newest recipe, uncle. Here, here, open your mouth.”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghamil did what he was told. Because Lyla didn’t like bitter medicine, she added lots of brown sugar. Lots and lots of brown sugar.</p>\n<p>“It’s… sweet.”</p>\n<p>“Are you feeling better, now?” Lyla asked.</p>\n<p>“Yes, little lady, I’m feeling better.”</p>\n<p>As a matter of fact, he wasn’t. The medicine was more like a candy than remedy.</p>\n<p>“Good! If you eat this three times a day, maybe your illness would go away, uncle,” Lyla then sternly pointed out, “maybe!”</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh was nervous when her husband consumed the strange medicine Lyla gave him, but she didn’t open her mouth to protest. Bhela was changing the pillows’ sheet nearby, and doing some other chores that usually were done by the servants. In the meantime, Lyla was giving advice for Patriarch Ghalim liked how he should eat moderately three times a day, how he should brush his teeth after he ate sweets, and all the things Aunt Jiji told Lyla all the time.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to visit again, uncle, get well soon!” Lyla waved her hands. Carrying a broom in her hands, Lyla’s next schedule was following Bhela doing chores in the courtyard.</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim weakly waved his hand back. Of course, after the girls were already gone, he noticed his bitter wife biting her lips indignantly.</p>\n<p>“Don’t stare the girl so much. She’s not responsible for her family’s wrongdoings. It’s not like a girl her age knows what her parents do behind the scene.”</p>\n<p>“Why did you eat that? What if they used her to give you more poison?”</p>\n<p>“Bhela wouldn’t let me have the medicine if she didn’t what it was, no? Stop putting that kind of face, you only make our daughter feels awkward about all this.”</p>\n<p>The woman held her husband’s hand, kissing it with her forehead as she hid her face. She whispered, “Oh, don’t you know how hurt this heart holding back my grievance? Why did our daughter had to bring someone from that family inside our roof?” she sniffed, “how long this farce gonna last? What should I do in the mean time? Oh! I don’t know! I don’t know!”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim sighed as he witnessed his wife cried helplessly.</p>\n<p>In the courtyard, near the coops where Malikh Family raised chickens and ducks, Lyla was squatting in front of the new bunny she and Bhela bought just yesterday. She was waiting the whole morning just to feed this bunny. The bunny hopped around, itching to play in spite it couldn’t resist the temptation of delicious green leaves, again and again. Wathing how glutton the bunny was, Lyla found herself immerse in immense joy. She very much envying the life of a bunny. Perhaps that because she could relate to how it spent its day without worry; eating, playing, sleeping, then playing again--a life that she longed to have. If only she was born a rabbit instead of a young lady of noble family….</p>\n<p>The sound of the broom swept the ground took away her attention. Lyla couldn’t understand how a daughter of a patriarch like Bhela had to work so much.</p>\n<p>“Why do you work so much, Sistah?” Lyla asked when she found out there still much dry leaves Bhela had to sweep. “Won’t you get bored soon? Just let the servants clean this place.”</p>\n<p>Bhela, sweeping as if Lyla’s idleness didn’t bother her the slightest, replied, “Here in Badril Village, everyone who hasn’t done their coming of age ceremony has to do chores for their parents. It doesn’t matter if it’s the farmer’s daughter or the biggest family’s young lady, helping the matter of the household is one of the seven virtues we Mossack people get to do for our parents.”</p>\n<p>Originally, Lyla wanted her friend also playing with the bunny. But hearing Bhela just said something serious, there was no way she’d reveal her intention now. “My mom always nagging me to go to dance lesson or whatever. It’s very very boring,” she murmured, a bit dejected.</p>\n<p>“The west and the south have different values,” Bhela said. “Complete your virtue for your parents then you’ll grow to be a fine lady, Lyla.”</p>\n<p>“Uggghhh…” Lyla grunted as she didn’t want to continue the topic any further. She long developed a sense for her own survival to detect whether or not the conversation ended up she being forced to do some boring stuff. Knowing Bhela’s personality, Lyla knew soon Sis Bhela’d make her doing chores too. Grabbing the bunny, Lyla quickly escaped somewhere else so that she could spend her time playing. Bhela shook her head seeing the girl’s behavior.</p>\n<p>Bhela then noticed some servants whispering while they looking at Lyla from the distance. Many people were curious what a noble young lady like her would do in a rural place like this, and Bhela wasn’t that oblivious not to notice the eyes planted by the elders of Malikh Family.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, she then saw four girls dressed in expensive garments approaching Lyla with their mouth covered with feathered fans in their hands. Their clothing looked as if they attending some sort of ceremony, while in fact, they calculated that this kind of appearance was the most suitable for them to socialize with a girl of blue-blooded origin. Bhela recognized the leader of those girls was actually Elder Jhamil’s niece.</p>\n<p>“Have you read Le Armour dan Varoza written by Leornador De Gonzalez, Young Lady Blackwood?”</p>\n<p>“Ah, yes, that piece was adequately sophisticated but I think Vista van Gracious’s omnibus more than adequate, le banjour?”</p>\n<p>“I see, I see, their pieces adequately well-written as those senor themselves adequattely live as maestro. But perhaps equoliette more than fit the diagram as paradigm sensorita abligioate senor des adequately le banjour.”</p>\n<p>“But of course, Young Lady Blackwood is more addequately sophisitacted as it’s a noblesse obligiote to be more sohpisitacated than us village senioritas. Perhaps le banjour is fortuna with de gracious by Young Lady’s great wisdom?”</p>\n<p>Lyla blinked her eyes trying to decipher whatever these girls mean. The bunny in her arms even escaped amidst her confusion.</p>\n<p>“Uhh… uhhh…” Lyla timidly stepped back from the feathered fan girls. “I think Sis Bhela is calling me…”</p>\n<p>She swiftly ran away back to her friend Bhela.</p>\n<p>“Sistah, Sistah Bhela!” Lyla cried and grabbing Bhela’s sloven sleeve tightly, demanding for justice, “they came to bully me!”</p>\n<p>“What did they do?” Bhela asked.</p>\n<p>“They know I can’t speak western language! They came to test me! They’re even worse than those rich girls in seminar--they jumble some western mumbo jumbo into plain language in order to confuse me! They must be laughing and call me stupid by now!”</p>\n<p>Hearing Lyla’s grievance, Bhela patted her head in order to let the girl calmed down.</p>\n<p>“Lyla, those girls are different than the noble girls that always making fun of you.”</p>\n<p>“Different? How so?”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at the girls who also was watching them back while fanning themselves with their fabulous feathered fans.</p>\n<p>“They looked like noble descendants, but actually were not.”</p>\n<p>“I still don’t like them nonetheless!”</p>\n<p>“You don’t have to talk to them if you don’t want to,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>Yet Lyla still restlessly tugging Bhela’s sleeves, making it harder for her to do her chores. Before the peers that always making fun of her, Lyla was always helpless and had been depending on Bhela’s figure as a shield. What it looked like from the point of view of an outsider was a scene where a young mother being tested of her patience dealing with a girl who was throwing a tantrum.</p>\n<p>Seeing that the young noble miss wouldn’t come back soon, the feathered fan girls approaching Bhela and Lyla instead.</p>\n<p>“Oh, fancy to meet Young Lady Bhela here, le banjour!”</p>\n<p>“Le bonjour…” Bhela hesitated to reply back. Tilting her head slightly, she studied the pompously dressed girls before her. These girls were relatives of Malikh Family’s elders. None of them could match with Bhela if talking strictly about social status wise, not to mention talents. However, while she was holding her broom, it looked like Bhela was the one with common origin, while these girls were floating swans who happened to be generous enough to greet plebeians with their <em>unique</em> vocabulary.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Lyla Blackwood hid behind Lyla’s back. Despite a noble origin herself, meeting more cocky and fake young ladies than the girls before her were rare experience for Lyla.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela, fancy to meet you. Good morning. The weather is nice. I eat snails everyday,” Elder Jhamil’s niece took the lead and said that with a hint of inflated pride.</p>\n<p>Bhela narrowed her eyes. She could see why Lyla instantly hated these girls. She then said in a sleek foreign language, “Je ne sais pas de quoi tu parles. Si vous ne parlez pas une langue étrangère, fermez simplement la bouche, sinon vous faites peur aux enfants avec votre non-sens.”</p>\n<p>The feathered fan girls blinked their eyes trying to decipher whatever Bhela had said.</p>\n<p>“Oh, it turns out Young Lady Bhela is aquadettely know some le banjour!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, Young Lady Bhela is adequately sophisticated after all. Me gusta!”</p>\n<p>“I see, I see, le pasta fortuna is delicosaza.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s niece didn’t say anything as she only maintained a sweet smile while being nervous herself. Racking her brains over remembering the contents of thick dictionary, she tried to form a decent sentences in foreign language. But Bhela then cut off her train of thought before she could say a word.</p>\n<p>“Blackwood Family is migrating noble that has long been making their roots here in southern land. Hundred of years living far away from their western peers, noble families like this would naturally become more lax. It’s natural for Lyla to not mastering her homeland’s native tongue.”</p>\n<p>Bhela said that in a straight manner. That was a white lie, however. It was true that many noble families coming from the western side of Tiramikal Continent to forgot their western root and began to see themselves as southerners. But those were usually the case depending right circumstances, like exiled nobles, or some young masters who had lost in political battle branched out and fancied themselves a legit noble family with themselves at the helm. Blackwood Family weren’t exiled nobles, and though Lyla’s ancestors branching out some hundreds of years ago, that didn’t automatically made them cutting off ties with the original family. The main family of Blackwood was back in a western country called Tatalghia Kingdom, still sending letters and envoys from time to time to the branch Lyla was living in--although, undeniably, the southern branch of Blackwood Family had long developed and surpassed the main one.</p>\n<p>It seemed like Bhela already used to tell this lie. Anyone who heard this would be forced to accept it, unless they wanted to spend time and resources digging through the details--which to be honest, none of these pompous young girls were willing or simply unable to go through.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Elder Jhamil’s niece believed Lyla’s family exempt her to excel in foreign language. Yet she was still displeased inside. Her uncle told her that Bhela had been hogging the young noble’s influence for herself, everyone in Malikh Family already knew how Bhela Malikh carrying around the noble young lady yesterday. So what if she had some more bit of talent and had been running around overseas in that whatever seminars she was attending? A bumpkin origin wouldn’t be able to change their bumpkin bloodline. So if Bhela had the right to get close with the Young Lady of Blackwood Family, that meant someone coming from the same family should have the same change as her!</p>\n<p>The elder’s niece said, “Young Lady Bhela, I know the main family is prideful. But Young Lady Blackwood is here to experience the village slow life. Don’t you think she also needs to mingle with us commoners?”</p>\n<p>“Lyla will befriend any person she fancies herself, I don’t control with whom she wants to socialize with,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“If that’s the case, then why she still has no friends other than you?”</p>\n<p>“That’s not true!” Lyla cried indignantly, “I’ve made friends! With aunties! Aunties in the kitchen!”</p>\n<p>It was easy to be friendly with Lyla. She was always unconventional and never saw people by the social system. To her, people only divided by two types, those who gave her food and those who didn’t. She was like a cat. Just bring a good food and she’d be very friendly the next moment.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Lyla’s frank open-mindedness wasn’t easily accepted by some people. Elder Jhamil’s niece gasped as she looked at Lyla and Bhela, back and forth. “My goodness! Young Lady Bhela, were you letting a noble young lady such as Young Lady Blackwood mingle with dirty servants?!”</p>\n<p>“Why wouldn’t I?” Bhela asked back.</p>\n<p>“You--don’t young lady care about our family’s reputation? What if people said we’ve mistreated a noble young lady?”</p>\n<p>“Lyla is here to experience village slow life,” Bhela said slowly, “don’t you think she also needs to mingle with commoners?”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s niece was speechless as Bhela used her own words. The contorted expression on her chaky make-up face brought satisfaction for Lyla, who then snorted.</p>\n<p>“What now? Kitty got your tongue?” Lyla said with her mouth pouted. “So that you know, Sis Bhela already made speechless many many bullies like you! Who were many many many times smarter than you! This is what you get by making fun of me--shame on you, hmph! Who’s the stupid one, now?”</p>\n<p>Even after losing a round of squabble against Young Lady Bhela, unexpectedly the nobly young lady herself became hostile against her. All was so sudden that it made blood drained from her face.</p>\n<p>Bhela ruffled Lyla’s hair. Apparently Lyla still believed these girls came to bully her. When Lyla already made up her mind to not liking someone, it was hard to bend on her opinion.</p>\n<p>“Let’s go, Lyla. We’ll help aunties make sweets for afternoon lunch,” Bhela said. Back in the seminars, when Bhela asked Lyla to do some chores, the supposed noble young lady of Blackwood Family would move slowly, occasionally pouting and murmuring some complaints, unwilling to exert her calories on some boring stuff. However, it was different if the destination was kitchen. The spirit of lively bunny would come to possess her--she’d jolt, sprinting, unwilling to waste time as the promise of free sweets and delicious salty snacks was revealed before her.</p>\n<p>“What was that about?!” one of the le bonjour girls scowled after Bhela and Lyla was gone. “How could a young lady speaks like that?”</p>\n<p>“Bhela must lead her around to act like that! Did you hear what she said? The noble young lady thinks we bully her or something.”</p>\n<p>“Aahhh! What a manipulative bitch! I really want to know what that little cunt said to make Young Lady Blackwood think we had made fun of her. No way in hell someone would dare making fun of a noble like her!”</p>\n<p>Actually, Lyla was made fun of so many times. Especially during her study in the seminars abroad. She made fun of so much that she formed a survival instinct to hide behind Bhela’s back. But they didn’t know that. They just assumed as a young lady coming from a noble family, Lyla Blackwood would be adequately pure noble in stories and gossip. The main reason Bhela brought Lyla away was so that Lyla didn’t have to mingle with these delusional le bonjour girls.</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-4/chapter-62":"<p>When the news about what happened in Malikh Family’s ngajen ceremony arrived at Blackwood Family, Madam Blackwood was so enraged she broke the tea cup she held onto the floor. Establishing the family’s foot in Badril Village was supposed to be easy, but not only he failed to gain the support of Malikh Family and the villagers, the Young Master of Blackwood Family somehow managed to incite the bedridden patriarch’s supporters to regain their lost foothold against the corrupt Malikh Family’s elders.</p>\n<p>“There’s no point keeping him in that rural village,” Madam Blackwood said. She was a flamboyant, late thirty years old woman whose beauty was so superior that the previous viscount adopt her as a daughter. “Call Frane back to the city, he’s going to spend two months training in capital!”</p>\n<p>The butler who was waiting for her bowed and went away to carry out the task.</p>\n<p>“How’s Lyla’s birthday party going?”</p>\n<p>“Reply to madam, the party has started, the guests who came only from baron nobilities and mid-rank merchants,” a maid replied.</p>\n<p>The madam glanced the timid middle-aged man who sat on the same table as her. She scoffed, saying, “Look how your daughter made a name for herself. Not only the bribe money was wasted away, she coming on trips in the seminars only resulting her made a fool out of herself! Hah, like father, like daughter! Imbecile!”</p>\n<p>Madam Blackwood hurled the new cup that recently poured with hot, scalding tea. She purposely aimed at the table so the hot water splashed on the viscount’s hands. The timid viscount didn’t make a sound when his hands getting burnt, he didn’t dare to fight against his wife. It was already ten years too late for him to retaliate in any way. From the way he dragged his limping leg to fetch damp towel for his scaling skin, it was clear the waiting servants already used to ignore him.</p>\n<p>Recently, his wife’s mood had became the worst ever since their youngest daughter came back from the two years seminars. Unlike Frane--who only registered as his son by blood in papers, Lyla hadn’t show any particular talents in becoming a Class worthy of a noble family. She had a decent progress speed, a Level 7 Novice after seminars, but that progress mainly because she never had the interest to train herself. Madam Blackwood had bribed the officials so Lyla could enter the seminars supposed to boost her standing in high society, so she could catch higher ranking nobles eyes somehow. However, that plan failed in the worst way that could happen to a noble family like the Blackwood. She made blunders and broke rules so many times that she became a laughing stock. The only families that interested in her only lower rank nobles and not-so well off merchant families.</p>\n<p>“There also no point keeping that useless girl forever in the mansion,” Madam Blackwood said. “Send her to Badril Village by tomorrow. Make some smart men tending to her needs--they have to smart enough to know how to reel those Malikh villagers to say yes when I send my words in the future!”</p>\n<p>After the son’s failure, the madam would send her daughter, to do nothing but play around in Malikh Family. Even if there was something the girl could do, the madam surely wouldn’t choose this daughter of hers who she deemed too brainless to do even the simplest tasks. Her daughter was just that useless to her. The one with received the orders were people who accompanied her, who had experience in bribing and coercing. They were tasked to devour Malikh Family from the inside. The Blackwood would surely corner Bhela Malikh this time.</p>\n<p>Somewhere else, in a colorless courtyard, a birthday party already went on for about two hours. Most guests already leaving, not unlike the year before the two-years seminars happened when the sons of noble families dallying around waiting for a chance to talk with the young lady. Today, the Young Lady of Blackwood Family turned fourteen, two years before she would considered mature, but this young miss still pouting her mouth like a little girl.</p>\n<p>The old handmaid saw her young lady was bored and offered a treat.</p>\n<p>“Young lady, try this cake. A certain famous bakery made this just for your birthday.”</p>\n<p>The cake served on a small plate along with a silver fork. The girl took only mere seconds to finish it.</p>\n<p>“Is it good?” the handmaid asked.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t matter if it’s good or not, Aunt Jiji, I still hungry with this tiny minny bit of cake! Let me eat that one!” the girl pointed at the layered cake served on the center of the party.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Lyla, you can’t!”</p>\n<p>“Why can’t I?!”</p>\n<p>“You must present yourself as a proper young lady, so you can’t!”</p>\n<p>The cake was to be portioned to serve for the same amount of guests since the last party, but because the Blackwood Family’s young lady had a bad reputation in the seminars, most invited families didn’t actually come.</p>\n<p>“But I can’t be a lady if I’m hungry, am I?”</p>\n<p>“You must learn the way. Be patient, Young Lady Lyla!”</p>\n<p>“But I am huuungriiiiieeeehhh!!!”</p>\n<p>Aunt Jiji was terrified when she realized the young lady wasn’t referred only to portion of the cake, but she wanted to eat the whole cake. This shorty girl, although her feature was thin with only her cheeks got plump, actually had a talent to be a terrifying glutton that would be seen in Tiramikal Continent every one hundred years. It was a useless talent that brought only shame to Blackwood Family.</p>\n<p>It was fortunate that before the young lady could make a big ruckus, a maidservant came to bring the news about the madam’s decision. Aunt Jiji passed it to the young lady immediately.</p>\n<p>“You heard that, young lady! Madam is going to send you for a vacation!”</p>\n<p>Lyla’s head straightened, she forgot to pout. “Vacation? Where? Where where?”</p>\n<p>“To Badril Village!”</p>\n<p>“Badril Village?” the girl tilted her head. “Where’s that?”</p>\n<p>“If you promise Aunt Jiji not to eat too much cake today, Aunt Jiji will tell you where it is…”</p>\n<p>“I will if it turned out somewhere fun!”</p>\n<p>“Badril Village is where Young Lady Bhela’s home place!”</p>\n<p>“Sis Bhela’s home?!” Lyla gasped, “yahoooo!!!”</p>\n<p>Ignoring that she was the center of attention, Lyla suddenly jumped and danced like no tomorrow. Aunt Jiji tried to stop her, but it was futile since Lyla only promised not to be glutton. The remaining guests began whispering with each other. They were people who doubted the rumors about this Young Lady Blackwood, but after seeing how childish and ridiculous the girl danced, people were finally convinced. How was this a viscount’s daughter supposed to act? The girl danced her hips and hopped around like a bunny that had an itchy bum. Soon, the Young Lady Lyla Blackwood fell to the bottom list of desired young ladies to marry. Her reputation fell from not-so-smart, to stupid, and then fell again to brainless and imbecile. People didn’t see her in a good light. But that just how a girl named Lyla Blackwood really was.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Yashura Family got a peculiar visitor these past two days. He introduced himself as an expert from overseas, and somehow this foreign expert became interested in Shira Yashura. When the story leaked by insiders from Yashura Family, people were scratching their heads, wondering what could an educated man saw from this trash who could only get himself to level 3 Novice. Some people even sneered, saying that whole news was just Yashura Family’s little trick to clear up rumors from their heir’s name.</p>\n<p>“You understand, kiddo? There are three mandatory rules if someone wants to meet privately with me. First rule, it’s a <em>she</em>, not <em>he</em>. Second rule, big boobs. Third rule, in her lower part, there must be big bubbly butts, as big as her boobs. <em>Anything</em> lesser than that you can just send them back to wherever they came from.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit said that as he moved his chess piece, eating one of Shira’s pawns.</p>\n<p>“And remember, my standard is pretty high. Consult with how loadful those girls from Big-Boobed Sect are for more information,” the Nalaq continued.</p>\n<p>“Please don’t talk nonsense. I’m being serious here,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“Ey, I’m not talking nonsense. The girls from Big-Boobed Sect are real deal, okay? They’re huge! If you don’t believe me then you should go to Elzhier Family one of these days, go check out how glorious their boobs are. They always dance or become the maidservants when they’re not on duties.”</p>\n<p>“Ol’ Good-Natured Spirit… I don’t want to hear this imaginary all-woman sect of yours. Elzhier Family is only a normal rural family, they don’t host any sect members within their walls. If they did, the Village Head would boast about it at my uncle’s face every single day.”</p>\n<p>“You just don’t believe it because you never see how great they are--their boobs, I mean. How great those melons inside tight suits are! Just think about it; leather suits and melons--two entirely different things but if they come together they’d jiggling in harmony. This Good-Natured Spirit approved their sense of style.”</p>\n<p>“Forget about it, it’s not important--”</p>\n<p>“Boobs are important, ey!”</p>\n<p>Shira waved his hand as he didn’t want to continue this nonsense. He then moved a piece and finished his turn. He returned the topic back again, “The expert said he came from a first-tier faction called Blue Robe Society. If we can get his faction’s recognition then at least my family can silence all those rumors about me--especially the recent ones, they really are becoming a pain in the ass.”</p>\n<p>“I told you. I don’t talk with guys. No boobs, no good. Period.”</p>\n<p>“You are really becoming a pain in the ass,” Shira complained.</p>\n<p>After Shira said that, Good-Natured Spirit’s knight jumped over a wall of pawns to get on his bishop. Within a single breath Shira immediately moved his rook, creating a chain reaction that exposes the Nalaq’s defence, resulting his king trapped in three different direction.</p>\n<p>“Check mate.”</p>\n<p>“Ey, what the fu--” Good-Natured Spirit rage quit, flipping the chess board. “Hah! I knew it! You brat, you intentionally make me talk about boobs in order to lower my guard, right?! Fuck! That is how it is, isn’t it?!”</p>\n<p>“No, it is not.”</p>\n<p>“You sneaky bastard. You really got me,” Good-Natured Spirit threw his hands up in the air. <br>\n“Man, I surrender, that is some sick psychological tactic you got there.”</p>\n<p>“Now I don’t really know what you’re talking about.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit waved his hands in surrender, then he lit a cigarette. “Anyway, what do you want from me this time? Money again? I prepared some kobe coins enough for you to buy some candy, here, take this.”</p>\n<p>Shira shoved back the coin bag. “Not today. I just want you to meet Sir Baront Staterwind.”</p>\n<p>“No boobs, no good. Ask something else. How about I tell you the secret place where are those Big-Boobed Sect girls take their bath, ‘ey? Seems fair deal to me.”</p>\n<p>“How many times do I have to tell you--”</p>\n<p>“Sssshhh!!” Good-Natured Spirit hushed the boy. He then whispered, “you hear that?”</p>\n<p>Because the Nalaq suddenly became vigilant, Shira instinctively lowered his voice too. “Hear what?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“I heard some rats watching us…” the Nalaq covered his mouth, as if he didn’t want people to read lips what he said next, “some big-boobed rats…”</p>\n<p>“Huh… what?”</p>\n<p>“The girls from Big-Boobed Sect… they’re here…”</p>\n<p>“The heck are you talking about? This hill is Yashura Family’s property--”</p>\n<p>“Sssshhhh! They’ve noticed me noticing them. Wait here, I’mma get you some melons for your reward!”</p>\n<p>After he saying that, Good-Natured Spirit’s figure melting into the thin air.</p>\n<p>Shira Yashura sighed. At times, asking favor to this vulgar Nalaq not only difficult, it also unpredictable he’d only incite troubles if he not careful.</p>\n<p>After his winning streak for more than half a year maybe he became cocky. He forgot the Nalaq wasn’t there to solve his problem whenever he wanted, although the Nalaq sort of ended up like that after a few months he came here. Shira got some thinking, maybe he should stop seeing this Nalaq as his convenient piggy bank for his own good.</p>\n<p>“Really, he always making a mess for me to clean. I wonder if such thoughtless Nalaqs like him are common around here… now, where’s the last piece again?” he sighed for the second time.</p>\n<p>When he was picking up chess pieces that board Good-Natured Spirit flipped earlier, Shira realized there was a missing piece. Turned out it was stuck in the hole between tree roots.</p>\n<p>He plunged his hand to look for the missing chess piece.</p>\n<p>“Ugh… my fingers can’t reach.”</p>\n<p>He tried to squirm his body to fit his hand in.</p>\n<p>“Where is it again?”</p>\n<p>He frowned. He squirmed his body again really hard.</p>\n<p>“Oh, there it--”</p>\n<p><em>BOOOOOMMMMM!!!!</em></p>\n<p>An explosion happened not far away from the place he used to hang out, creating a wave of rolling dust that swept over the hill. Shira got his hand stuck between the tree rots, he could only hugged his head with his free hand and waited for the shockwave to finish. The chess pieces he gathered already nowhere to be found. He cooked up his head, looking left and right, and saw the greeny grasses were covered with dirts and trees were uprooted. The whole hill became a shithole kind of mess.</p>\n<p>Before the boy could swallow what was going on, a chuckle could be heard near him. Before him, Good-Natured Spirit emerged, coiling around the Nalaq’s body were purple-colored living flames that hungrily tried to eat him whole.</p>\n<p>As carefree as he usually was, Good-Natured Spirit said with a grin, “Those Big-Boobed Sect girls sure are feisty. They’re escaping too fast, I can’t get you melons. I managed to get a feeling of their butts, though. Here, there’s some fragrant left behind.”</p>\n<p>Shira stepped back when the Nalaq offered his palm. It was still on fire, the boy didn’t want to get burn along with him. Besides, he didn’t want to get involved with the Nalaq’s deprived hobby.</p>\n<p>“Sure you don’t want it?” Good-Natured Spirit took a last sniff from his palm, followed by a low chuckle of his.</p>\n<p>“Good-Natured Spirit… what’s that fire?”</p>\n<p>“Yeah? Dunno, man. Exorcism flame or something.”</p>\n<p>“Ohh… oh, it’s very nice to know you up until know. Good bye.”</p>\n<p>“Hmm? You want to go somewhere?” Realizing the purple flame was getting annoying, Good-Natured Spirit then patted away the coiling flame from his shoulders like it was nothing.</p>\n<p>Shira shrugged his shoulders. It seemed this bastard Nalaq was too tough for that exorcism flame. Maybe the flame was too ordinary? Whatever, he didn’t care about that anymore. His eyes then swept the ruin around him. He said, “You can’t forget about the meeting for today. But please clean the mess you made yourself.”</p>\n<p>“That’s what you want for the chess reward?”</p>\n<p>Shira nodded.</p>\n<p>“Aye, aye, will do.” Good-Natured Spirit flicked his fingers, and human-sized paper cranes came out of thin air. They were obedient, not clear whether were monsters or just magical devices. The paper cranes used magnet-like magic to carry the messy uprooted trees and boulders, along with sweeping the dirt from the grass. The cleaning up might take a while, since the hill really was a mess. Shira, feeling a little light on the head, facepalming as he returned back to Yashura Family.</p>\n<p>The whole explosion could be heard from all over Badril Village. It wasn’t clear what its cause, but Yashura Family sent guards to prevent people from knowing what really happened. In Yashura Family’s guest hall, Patriarch Shuro Yashura, a few good Yashura Family elders, and the respected visitor, Sir Baront Staterwind, forming a circle as they sat cross-legged, discussing the explosion that had just occurred.</p>\n<p>“Good elders, Sir Patriarch Yashura, I know you must get excited when I said Young Master Shira has some talent in communicating with Nalaqs. However, a Nalaq still a Nalaq. You must not offend a Nalaq whatsoever, or the consequence is dire! Young Master Shira’s life is way more important than getting a qualification to enter my school!” Sir Baront Staterwind warned. His forehead was still wet with sweat, since he hurriedly ran to Yashura Family when he realized the direction of recent explosion.</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, you’re right, Sir Staterwind. Absolutely right! I already sent someone to check on my nephew’s condition, please calm down,” Patriarch Shuro said.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront shook his head. “You don’t really know what I’m trying to say, do you? You should prepare a very good healer or a doctor, Patriarch Shuro, because if it isn’t death, one can easily lose a limb over angering a Nalaq! That happens more often than you think!”</p>\n<p>The elders drew cold breaths in unison when they heard that. Patriarch Shuro, whose face already pale, becoming even whiter than a sheet of paper. If they boy lost a limb, Shira’s chance to succeed him as the next patriarch could be swept away like specks of dust.</p>\n<p>Yulong the Butler arrived. Everyone in the room had been anxiously waiting for him they instinctively stood up when Yulong approached.</p>\n<p>“Yulong, how’s Shira doing?” Patriarch Shuro asked.</p>\n<p>Yulong replied, “Young Master Shira is back, patriarch. But Madam Yashura sent him to the kitchen for a second breakfast.”</p>\n<p>“Breakfast? What’s a breakfast has something to do with that explosion? Can he still walk?”</p>\n<p>“He’s walking fine, Patriarch Yashura.”</p>\n<p>“Then, Yulong, please go fetch my nephew for me, we have something urgent to tell him!”</p>\n<p>After his trained elegant bow, Yulong stepped back and proceeded to do the task given to him.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront Staterwind peered at the butler’s back. He traveled southern lands many times, visiting many villages, yet, he seldom heard a Mossack descent major family employed western-style butler. What made him confused even more that Sir Kurusiya apparently knew the butler and gave his respect to him, which Sir Baront Staterwind didn’t expect that coming from the cold eastern Kaya swordsman.</p>\n<p>“Dear good elder,” Sir Baront Staterwind asked a random elder who sat beside him, “may I know why there’s a butler working here?”</p>\n<p>“Is Sir referring to Yulong? Yulong isn’t actually working for Yashura Family, but Young Master Shira’s mother’s attendant. I can’t tell you the details, so forgive me sir, all I can say is Young Master Shira’s father is exceedingly brave and awesome he managed to woo a respectable lady many years ago.”</p>\n<p>“Ahhh…” Sir Baront nodded. The boy apparently a result of his parent eloping. The Blue Robe Society expert of course knew etiquette to hold himself from digging the story further.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, Yulong came back with Shira followed behind. The boy wore new clothes since his previous one was dirty. When he saw the group of elders and the expert guest looking at him, Shira sighed inside his heart. He knew he had to clean Good-Natured Spirit’s mess once again.</p>\n<p>“Greetings, elders… greetings, uncle patriarch… greetings, Sir Staterwind…”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro impatiently treading forward. “Shira my boy, is it true that you lost your limbs?”</p>\n<p>“I’m unhurt, uncle, see?” Shira waved both of his hands to prove that his limbs still functioned as they should be.</p>\n<p>“Oh! God, thank God! Really! These are really your hands, aren’t they? Not a fake one made with wood?” Patriarch Shuro Yashura grabbed his nephew hands and waved it around like a child playing with flags.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira,” Sir Baront opened his mouth, “I reckon you failed to ask the Nalaq to meet me? If you can’t do it, young master, it best for you not to push him any further. Today, you offend him and he blast the hill behind your Yashura Family as a warning, but what happens if you make the same mistake tomorrow?”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro nodded at his words vigorously. “Sir Baront is right, Shira my boy. A Nalaq is a revered being ancient Mossacks worshiped as their guardian angel. The consequence of making them mad is very dire! You should know better, my boy, you should’ve told your uncle if a Nalaq came to you the first time!”</p>\n<p>Sir Baront and his uncle Patriarch Shuro had good intentions in telling him about how to be respectful to a Nalaq. But the more Shira heard their warning, the more he doubted about Good-Natured Spirit being a “revered” Nalaq like they said. Of course, saying the truth about the explosion’s true cause resulting only Yashura Family losing face in front of Sir Baront Staterwind. Shira had no choice, he had to tread the matter very carefully.</p>\n<p>“<em>Cough, cough</em>… Uncle, Sir Baront, thank you for your concern. Truth is, it wasn’t that the Nalaq being mad that causes the explosion, but there was some… accident… that happened right before.”</p>\n<p>“With what title do you usually call him, Young Master Shira?” Sir Baront asked.</p>\n<p>“As far as I know, he doesn’t have a title. At least he didn’t tell me if he ever had one. He told me to call him ‘Good-Natured Spirit’.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, with that kind of nickname, he must be a very benevolent person when he was alive,” Sir Baront concluded as he rubbed his beard. “So, Young Master Shira, it seems he didn’t really intent to blast into smithereens.”</p>\n<p>Shira nodded. That part was true. Instead, someone else happened to be intending to blast this Nalaq into smithereens.</p>\n<p>“Thank God! Thank God! If he is a good Nalaq, maybe we don’t need to throw the second ngajen ceremony for this month, after all!” Patriarch Shuro Yashura exclaimed. The elders in the guest hall followed his exclaiming by handclapping and joyful cries. Ngajen ceremony only held once a month so the village safe from angry Selaqs, no one ever tried it to protect themselves from intelligent Nalaqs. Since the village was founded, the locals never had a Nalaq dwelling there. So it was natural for the elders to worry about throwing a ceremony they didn’t know working or not. Ngajen ceremony was expensive, after all.</p>\n<p>The more Shira saw how the previous tense hall turned jubilant and full of relieved faces, the more awkward he became. That Nalaq might call himself ‘Good-Natured Spirit’, yet he was anything but good. A low-life spirit who no doubt had been using the invisibility traits of spirits to commit many deprived crimes. He was closer to evil spirit incarnation than a good-natured one. The misunderstanding was too great his face twisted as if he’d just taste a sour lemon.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront Staterwind said, “Still, since he seems reluctant to use his old name, I reckon the Nalaq that approaching you is a low-tier one, Young Master Shira. Low-tier Nalaqs usually spirits that gain consciousness merely by luck. They don’t have factions backing them, and fortunately--in my experience--it easier to initiate negotiation with unaffiliated Nalaqs.” A hint of pride then flashed through his eyes, he continued, “my disciples will arrive tomorrow morning. One of them contracted with a high-tier Nalaq. Since the Nalaq’s mood turned sour is partly my fault, with help from the Nalaq contracted with one of my disciples, I will ask him to leave Yashura Family peacefully!”</p>\n<p>“Sir Staterwind is wise! Thank you for your concern, Sir!” Patriarch Shuro sang praises toward this expert. The elders of Yashura Family followed suit.</p>\n<p>“As expected of such expert!”</p>\n<p>“Sir Staterwind is the best of bunch of all experts that I know all my life!”</p>\n<p>“Hurray for Sir Staterwind!”</p>\n<p>They circling Sir Baront Staterwind and, not long after that, someone started to prostate. They behaved as if the guest was their one and only savior. Even Shira was getting embarrassed from seeing the scene, not to mention the already flushing Baront Staterwind.</p>\n<p>When everyone getting carried away, Shira slipped out after excusing himself. He knew he was no match for the Yashura Family’s older generations’ shamelessness. Upon walking outside, he saw Yulong was standing by the hall’s door looking galant as usual with his butler professionalism.</p>\n<p>“Can you please try to stop my uncle, Yulong? Sir Staterwind is started to get uncomfortable there.”</p>\n<p>Yulong glanced at the whole mess inside, and then he said to his young master, “I think it’s not everyday an expert coming to Yashura Family, young master, so let’s count this as Patriarch Yashura to gaining favors from a foreign expert.”</p>\n<p>“Are they really okay, though?”</p>\n<p>Yulong smiled.</p>\n<p>“Of course they aren’t, young master. But Patriarch Shuro and the family elders are honest people. Although sometimes they can be overwhelming, I’m sure Sir Staterwind can see no falsehood in their words.”</p>\n<p>Shira looked at those elders inside once again. The more he saw, the more he realized that those hysterical village men calling a man they barely knew these past two days a savior by no means a lie from their part. The elders really were freaking out when they heard the explosion. And Patriarch Shuro Yashura was the most worried of the bunch, considering him a patriarch and an uncle. Thinking about it all again, Shira couldn’t really say he still embarrassed seeing the elders spewing exaggerated flattering with straight faces.</p>\n<p>“Sir Staterwind comes from a respectable sect. Someone like that won’t get to travel the southern lands if he didn’t know the nature of the local people. So it best not to worry about it too much, young master,” Yulong said.</p>\n<p>“Really… ah, speaking of sects,” Shira deliberately changed the topic, “I heard from someone that one of the major families in Badril Village hosts members of a certain sect in secret. You’re from outside, Yulong--do you think something so outrageous like that could happen?”</p>\n<p>“Some older sects have long reaching influence, but I don’t think anyone would be interested to plant their own in Badril Village. There’s nothing valuable here for them to take notice.”</p>\n<p>“As I thought. It’s just unthinkable to think some secret powers lurking beneath our everyday lives. What if some experts actually pretending to be servants here in Yashura Family?”</p>\n<p>Although it wasn’t noticeable, Yulong’s smile became stiff.</p>\n<p>“You jest, young master. If that was true, do you think your uncle and the elders can take that kind of truth?”</p>\n<p>Following Yulong’s gaze, Shira peeped the hall and saw Sir Baront’s awkward figure, where he was in the center of Yashura Family elites--all of them-- who passionately prostrating in the floor. They practically worshipping him now.</p>\n<p>“You’re right…” Shira could only hide his face with his palm. Just when he thought he could understand them, the boy then wished he didn’t know these shameless men.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>As far as the current generation of Badril Village locals knew, they never got visited by nobles until this month Malikh Family’s ngajen ceremony happened. Everyone still talking about it.</p>\n<p>Young Master of Blackwood Family only stayed in Badril Village in one day. And the noble carriage of Blackwood Family set off out of Badril Village by noon. The next morning after the day he was gone, the two foreign guests who had been staying in Malikh Family, Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia, felt overstaying might be unnecessary, thus decided to leave too.</p>\n<p>Because the carriages going out from Badril Village mostly for public transports, Bhela personally asked an elder from his father’s faction who had a horse carriage to give her guests a ride to the nearest town, where they’d later book a private carriage for them to return home. Mister Harrington, as an unsocial bachelor as he always was, was waiting in the carriage for Madame Sylvia to say her parting words to Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>“You have a very bright future, Young Lady Bhela. A girl with limitless potential. So your favor will become very valuable as you mature,” Madame Sylvia said. “If you need something, you can always send letters to my sect. Don’t hold back. Just think about this of us making an investment.”</p>\n<p>Since Bhela a smart girl anyway, Madame Sylvia decided not to make her words fancy and told her in a straightforward manner. Bhela appreciated her honesty, and said her thanks.</p>\n<p>The carriage then set off. In the main gate of Badril Village, the guards on duty witnessed the recently blazing popular Young Lady Bhela Malikh bowing her body as she sent off two foreigners in traveling clothes made from expensive linen.</p>\n<p>“Look at how she is,” inside the carriage, Madame Sylvia said to Mister Harrington. “She’s a pretty sensible girl, don’t you think?”</p>\n<p>“She is,” Mister Harrington said softly, almost a murmur.</p>\n<p>It was hard to start a conversation whenever Mister Harrington sat with his arms crossed tightly. Madame Sylvia could see that he wasn’t exactly happy with the outcome regarding Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>There was no bandits lurking around, and no monsters occasionally came out, proved that the lands around Badril Village actually well-protected--too well, perhaps, for a rural village without a major power backing them. Their journey was smooth without disturbance. Thirty minutes after they left Badril Village, they encountered another carriage painted with black-jet color. The black carriage was well-decorated with golden-colored plates, obviously elites or nobles were traveling inside.</p>\n<p>However, unlike common nobles who liked to hide in the carriage to show-off their elegance and aloofness, this carriage simply out of commonsense. To talk about how weird this carriage was there was a need to point out the refreshing greenness of the view around. Despite there being a road far away from settlement, hint of liveliness from bird chirping--along with croaking frogs from nearby streams and singing insects--completed the idyllic road with a strange harmony that invited light-hearted person to sing along with lively nature. That was exactly what the noble in the black carriage doing. A young lady with a very girly and childish feature was carefreely sitting in the window in spite of pale servants begging her to sit still. She completely dumb about the servants’ pleas. And with her personality, nobody knew whether she was pretending or not. The only thing that the jubilant Lyla Blackwood cared about was singing an off-tune song about her befriending village frogs and bunnies.</p>\n<p>“Prepare your life you frogs and bunnies~</p>\n<p>Cause I’m not letting you go before we become the best of buddies~~</p>\n<p>Wait for me you birdies and kitties~~</p>\n<p>Cause we’re about to become the best of all buddies~~ yuhuu~ yuhuu~~</p>\n<p>The best buddies in this lifetime~~ yuhuuuu~~~”</p>\n<p>There was nothing the servants and the guards could do to stop their young lady from singing this amazingly ugly song about her future exploits in Badril Village. Seeing that another carriage approaching, the horse-riding guards did their best to block the view to the crest planted on the carriage’s compartment. Their effort to save faces from the young lady’s mishap was futile, however, since the other party happened to know Lyla.</p>\n<p>“How many times have I told you to stay away from windows, Lyla!”</p>\n<p>“Whu--what? Who?” Lyla was surprised. But then she was elated to see a familiar face. “Is that you, Instructor Sylvia? You here to train Sis Bhela’s archery again?”</p>\n<p>“Get down from the window!” Madame Sylvia raised her voice.</p>\n<p>“I’m also here to meet Sis Bhela!” Lyla also raised her voice cheerfully.</p>\n<p>“Lyla, you won’t be able to get married in the future if you’re always act like this!” Madame Sylvia warned her. She long dropped title of Young Lady Blackwood when talking to this naughty girl.</p>\n<p>“Um!” Lyla nodded. “But which one do you like more, Instructor Sylvia, bunnies or kitties?” It was no use trying to talk sense to Lyla. Any warning only come to her right ear and gone out straight from the left one.</p>\n<p>“Stay away from the windows!!!” Madame Sylvia screamed until her voice shrilled.</p>\n<p>Lyla also screamed, “Good morning to you too!!!”</p>\n<p>Both carriages drifted apart after the brief encounter. It ended with Lyla happily waved her hands happily. Madame Sylvia sighed and shook her head. That girl was so naughty that the troubles she created made the seminars’ managements even considered to drop her once during the seminars. Only after Bhela Malikh convinced them she’d take care of Lyla they finally did let go the matter.</p>\n<p>Before, the black carriage of Blackwood Family came to Badril Village in the shroud of night’s darkness, so nobody noticed their elegance and the aura of expensive carriage blazing through the village road--of which was surprisingly wide for a settlement road, unlike road of cities in the western kingdoms, because long ago Mossack people needed to endure monster stampedes passing through their villages once every few months.</p>\n<p>“Mom, look, is that a noble?” a snotty kid pointing out the carriage.</p>\n<p>The mother hurriedly pulled her child. “Ssuuussh! Keep your finger to yourself! Don’t you know what happened to peasants that make noble angry from the stories they always talking about?”</p>\n<p>The steel-armored guards who escort the carriage scoffed them in disdain. Contrast with the escorts’ attitudes, Lyla waved her hand at them, while shouting, “Hey boy, don’t you think bunnies are cute as the kitties? Or do you like cats more?”</p>\n<p>The kid didn’t answer. He instead forced to bow by her mother and let the carriage went through silently. The villagers didn’t have the experience in receiving nobles, most of them--except for those who attended the ngajen ceremony in Malikh Family--had never saw nobles in their lives. Because of that they were awkward and didn’t know what to do.</p>\n<p>Lyla didn’t seem to mind their stiffness. Instead, she vigorously greeted everyone she saw from the window she sat on.</p>\n<p>“Good day! Good morning! I’m here to sleepover at Sis Bhela’s place! Do you know where Sis Bhela lives?”</p>\n<p>Back in Elzhier Family, in the main family’s house, their patriarch, hurriedly changed his clothes to a formal one he always used every ngajen ceremony.</p>\n<p>“Hurry, hurry! As the head of this village, how can I let a noble arriving without me receiving them?!”</p>\n<p>Not even he yet buttoned his shirt properly, the Village Head sprinted toward the main street, only to see the crowd of onlookers already dispersed and still talking about the scary nobles they always heard in stories were actually <em>weirdly</em> friendly.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Bhela Malikh was already notified about Lyla Blackwood’s arrival. She waited on a chair at the Malikh Family’s gate, drinking a fresh young coconut water occasionally. The black carriage finally was in her view. And the young girl she was waiting for happily waved her hand at her. From the window.</p>\n<p>“Carefull, Lyla!” Bhela yelled as she sprang from her chair.</p>\n<p>“Huuupp!” Lyla Blackwood simply didn’t want to waste anytime leaving the carriage through the door. So she simply jumped from the window she sat upon, before the carriage even stopped. It was fortunate that amongst Bhela’s skill as a Unique Class, she had <b>Haste</b>, which boosted her speed in short duration. She used that to catch Lyla before she hurt herself. The young noble girl landed splendidly in Bhela’s arm.</p>\n<p>“What’s this, Sistah?” Lyla’s eyes sparkled when she saw Bhela get a young coconut in her other hand. She was completely oblivious she just did something dangerous.</p>\n<p>“Young coconut. There’s still some of its water left. Here, try this,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“For me? Really?”</p>\n<p>“Drink slowly…”</p>\n<p><em>Glug glug glug</em>. Lyla drank the coconut in anything but in slowly manner. She even burped shamelessly.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Lyla, ah!” the butler who coming with her was in horror seeing how Young Lady Lyla Blackwood made a horrible mess by spilling the coconut water on her expensive, silk woven black dress. Only an equally expensive silk handkerchief worthy enough to wipe his young lady’s noble dress!</p>\n<p>“I told you to drink slowly…” Bhela said. She used her sleeve to wipe Lyla’s wet face, and then proceeded to also wipe Lyla’s dress.</p>\n<p>“Y-young miss!” the butler shouted in panic. His body jolted as soon as he saw the outrageous act of spoiling the young noble’s dress by making it contacted with commoner clothes. That was heresy! He needed her to stop before she contained Blackwood’s expensive dress with her commoner’s bacteria!</p>\n<p>“You need something?” Bhela looked at this unfamiliar butler of Blackwood Family. Her expressionless face judged the butler coldly.</p>\n<p>“My name is Tim, young miss--please use this!” the butler offered a silky smooth handkerchief with Blackwood Family’s crest embroidered on the surface. The handkerchief was actually the butler’s, was awarded to his great-great-great grandfather by the then Baron Blackwood for some sort of achievement that practically nobody was still alive to remember. Everytime Butler Tim met a new person, he’d make an excuse to show off this particular handkerchief. Today was no exception. It was his most precious handkerchief. Just from the look of it one could tell how crazy expensive it was.</p>\n<p>“Ah, ah… my nose… aahhh--” Lyla felt her nose was wet and itchy, “--ahhtchii!!!”</p>\n<p>“You’ve got a flu?” Bhela asked worriedly.</p>\n<p>“Yeah. Aunt Jiji told me to drink my medicine everyday but it’s so bitter. So much bitter that it’s evil!”</p>\n<p>“Where’s your medicine now?”</p>\n<p>“Oh. I throw it away last night.”</p>\n<p>Bhela shook her head.</p>\n<p>“That’s no good. You can’t throw away your medicine like that. Now, wipe your nose. This mister butler said to use this…” she put the handkerchief on Lyla’s nose, and Lyla blew her nose on it.</p>\n<p>Lyla gave back the handkerchief to Butler Tim. “Thank you, Sir Butler. It’s very helpful of you.”</p>\n<p>The butler received back his most precious handkerchief. Bonus Lyla’s snot.</p>\n<p>“Come on inside,” Bhela said to Lyla. “Even if the water runs dry, coconuts still have meat we can scoop. After that we’ll pick some star fruits that I planted since I was a child.”</p>\n<p>“Star fruits! Woohooo!”</p>\n<p>The girls then walked inside. Lyla was so excited she didn’t leave her friend, hanging on her neck like a koala being comfortable on a tree branch. The stories about a noble young lady coming to Malikh Family for Bhela Malikh spread amongst the maidservants like oil being poured on an open wildfire. The Malikhs couldn’t describe the pride seeing their eldest young lady with a blue blood friend. Especially the aunties. They watched how close Bhela and Lyla with teary eyes and happy smiles.</p>\n<p>“Young lady is… finally… finally…”</p>\n<p>“She finally has a friend…”</p>\n<p>“Huuu… huuu… merciful Goddesses finally saw the young lady’s plight and blessed her with a real friend… huuu huuuu….”</p>\n<p>Nobody more happier than the aunties who were familiar with how their Young Lady Bhela lived her live. They silently cried watching their young lady, who usually alone and unapproachable, finally grown up and had her first friend in these past ten years.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Butler Tim grimaced inside. Despite the fact that he was tasked to win over Bhela Malikh with any means necessary, he didn’t like this girl. It wasn’t because his handkerchief got dirty--well, maybe he resented her for it a little--it because the girl named Bhela Malikh wasn’t acting as a young country girl supposed to act. Country bumpkins supposed to falter when they saw the radiance seeped out of the nobles’ aura, they supposed to tremble when they saw the noble wealth glittering beneath the sun. But this girl was indifferent and aloof. She was cold but the coldness paired with concise and elegant mannerism. Butler Tim knew she trying to act noble herself. That was why he didn’t like her.</p>\n<p>However, Butler Tim was a smart person. Any smart person would wear a perfect smile despite his heart bleeding over the snot on his precious handkerchief. Before leaving the city, the butler didn’t forget to look for a gift he’d use to lower the Malikh Family’s guard. He heard the previous gift was rejected, and when he asked for the content of the gift, the smart Butler Tim shook his head as if he knew it would happen.</p>\n<p>Toward country bumpkins, too expensive gifts would never work. He knew this because he was smart. And because he was smart, he knew better gifts. Not-so-expensive gifts worked for country bumpkins.</p>\n<p>Therefore, he presented Bhela Malikh with popular city biscuits.</p>\n<p>“I heard this biscuit is currently very popular among noble young ladies. This butler happened to pass by a store that sold this, so I reckon Young Lady Bhela might love to taste some.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, because the elders roughly knew the Blackwood Family’s youngest lady would come to visit, two leaders of opposing factions came to watch how their Young Lady Bhela would receive the noble guest. Elder Jhamil was all smiling because he liked what he saw. But the expression of Elder Khasim turned sour when he saw how the butler of Blackwood Family tried to butter up to Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>“Don’t accept it, young lady, please….” Elder Khasim whispered under his breath. Of course, there was no single soul heard what he just said. He was worried the hard work to rebuild his faction’s morale all would turn into dust if people thought their spiritual mascot, the one and only Young Lady Bhela Malikh, could be bought with mere biscuits.</p>\n<p>Contrary to what Elder Khasim hoped, Bhela Malikh received the gift without even putting a second thought. A feeling of defeat surged inside him. Elder Jhamil looked at his rival with a mocking glance.</p>\n<p>After receiving the snacks, Bhela excused herself and brought Lyla with her to stroll around Malikh Family’s gardens. Butler Tim pretended to wave his hand and smiled, but inside, he was gloating at how hypocrite Bhela was. His guess that Young Lady Bhela wouldn’t refuse the gift he brought was entirely correct. Before, he deliberately said the biscuit was noble young ladies’ favorite. Thus, according to his smart logic, as long as it wasn’t too expensive that it’d scare this fake young lady, no way a noble wannabe would reject this kind of gifts.</p>\n<p>“Heh,” Butler Tim scoffed when Bhela and Lyla already left. “Bet you’ve never eaten any city biscuits your entire life, haven’t you.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, Bhela Malikh hadn’t had any city biscuits her entire life. Not before and also not today. What Butler Tim didn’t know was that the snacks he bought with his own money ultimately ended up returned to Blackwood Family--to be exact, it ended up inside Lyla Blackwood’s belly. Bhela couldn’t help but received the biscuits when, beside her, she saw Lyla was drooling looking at the biscuits.</p>\n<p>The elders led by Elder Jhamil then respectfully welcomed the butler along with servants and guards from Blackwood Family. From the impression alone, Butler Tim could see reasons for him to like this slick-tongued Elder Jhamil. He knew how to flatter and also he knew how to act humble in front of people with higher status than him. Not like that noble-wannabe Young Lady of Malikh Family. This Elder Jhamil knew that he was only a country bumpkin thus acted accordingly. Naturally, the smart Butler Tim was pleased.</p>\n<p>And so began Butler Tim’s quests to swallow Malikh Family with his smartly planned schemes and cunning political games.</p>\n<p>In mere hours, the neutral elders who hadn’t joined either both rivalling factions began flocking to Elder Jhamil’s side. One part because they wanted to side with the faction that had the noble support and another part simply because Elder Jhamil, with the help of Butler Tim, had been throwing around sweet deals over all directions.</p>\n<p>“Only one tenth of the elder council members don’t want to pick a side by now, but their number is too significant to be an obstacle for Sir Butler’s great plan,” Elder Jhamil reported the current situation to Butler Tim.</p>\n<p>The butler was enjoying a glass of tea served by the maid that supposed to serve Young Lady Lyla Blackwood as if he was the visiting noble himself. He nodded. “I see. With this, the first stage of my plan has been completed.”</p>\n<p>“Oohhh!” Elder Jhamil exclaimed. “Sir Butler summoned rain and fire by flipping Malikh Family’s political scene upside down, and this is only the first stage?! As expected, the Butler of Blackwood Family is very smart!”</p>\n<p>Butler Tim originally wanted to act aloof and sophisticated before he visited this rural village. However, upon being called a smart person, he couldn’t help but grinned widely. “Oho, you’re an interesting fella, aren’t you? Very well, since you’ve done a good job yourself, I won’t be so petty to grab all the credit. Tell me how I should do next, if I like what I hear, we might as well corporate your thoughts into my plan.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was excited. How could he not? An opportunity to rise beyond a mere elder of rural village was laid before him.</p>\n<p>“Sir Butler, you may not know this, but we Mossack people regard having a good meal very highly. Everytime we’re having breakfast or dinner together as the entire family, even though we’re always looked peaceful outside, those trivial events actually are a political battlefield for us elders to extend our influence! This lowly man himself used a few move in the past during breakfast to gather like-minded men under my banner. I used all my resources and connections in a single mealtime to attack my rivals! However, these past two days, my biggest rival used a lowly method against me…”</p>\n<p>“Oh? What did he do?” Butler Tim asked.</p>\n<p>“He didn’t do much,” Elder Jhamil said, sneering when he was talking about this rival of his, “all he did was inviting Young Lady Bhela everytime we were having a meal in the family hall. He’s been a stubborn and ignorant supporter of main family, but this time he actually knew how to use his connection with the main family to deal a blow against me. A few of the elders had been faltering when they saw Young Lady Bhela leaning over the other side; I’m afraid if we’re leaving this ignorant rival of me doing as he wanted, there’s gonna be a hole in Sir Butler’s smart plan!”</p>\n<p>Butler Tim swirled the tea in his cup as though he was deep in thought. Of course, if this proven to endanger his smart plan, the butler couldn’t sit still watching all that happened. “I heard the Mossacks are peculiar people, but I don’t know you Mossack people have a strange custom!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, we’re living here far away from the city, so of course our traditions might seem unsophisticated to wise westerners like Sir Butler,” Elder Jhamil fawned.</p>\n<p>“Then what do you suggest Blackwood Family should do in this situation, Elder Jhamil?”</p>\n<p>“It’s easy!” Elder Jhamil was so excited he almost jumped from his seat. “My rival faction used Young Lady Bhela to gain foothold, and we can also use that to deal a greater blow back to them!”</p>\n<p>“And that is?”</p>\n<p>“Of course, we can use--I mean, we can invite young noble miss to a dinner together with us. With this we can unofficially announce our alliance with Blackwood Family! It’s the final nail to main family’s faction!”</p>\n<p>Even though Bhela Malikh’s status as a Unique Class shone throughout all of Badril Village, her name still fall short with a pure noble like Lyla Blackwood. Madam back in Blackwood Family used her daughter so Blackwood could infiltrate Malikh Family easily, but that didn’t mean Lyla still wasn’t as useful.</p>\n<p>“Very well. Let us go with that,” then he asked the maid responsible for Lyla’s schedule. “What was Young Lady Lyla doing this afternoon?”</p>\n<p>The maid replied, “Young Lady Bhela Malikh carried her around to play. At first, they went to Malikh Family’s orchard to pick some fruits. Then they visited the sick Patriarch Malikh in his room for a few minutes. After that, they went outside to stroll and came back with a new rabbit pet they bought from other family. Finally, when the sun is setting, they went to the kitchen to watch the servants cooking.”</p>\n<p>“How uncouth for a noble young lady being led around in dirty places like that,” Butler Tim was displeased, but nothing he could do since making Bhela’s attention elsewhere meant he could move freely to make a trap for her. Nodding to himself, the butler then gave an instruction to the maid, “you go to Young Lady Lyla and tell that Malikh Family invite her for a dinner.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was excitedly rubbing his hands when Butler Tim said that. Finally, payback to those imbecile Elder Khasim!</p>\n<p>“But, Butler Tim…” the maid hesitated.</p>\n<p>“What is it?”</p>\n<p>“Malikh Family already invited Young Lady Lyla to have dinner. She’s eating in Malikh Family’s hall right now….”</p>\n<p>“Hmm, what do you mean?”</p>\n<p>What the maid meant was that someone in Malikh Family already brought Lyla to have dinner with them.</p>\n<p>When Butler Tim playing political games and scheming around in Malikh Family, Bhela Malikh, along with the elders friendly with Elder Khasim, had been giving bunch of candies and food for Lyla Blackwood, much more than the biscuits Butler Tim brought with him. Being a great foodie herself, Lyla never had enough, the first day in Malikh Family she ate more sweets and foods worth of one week back in Blackwood Family’s manor. Aunt Jiji and other Blackwood Family’s maid servants would freak out if they saw how glutton Lyla currently was.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the news that the main family’s faction hosting a dinner for a noble miss swept Malikh Family like a thunderstorm. The neutral elders Elder Jhamil had just bought flocking back toward Elder Khasim’s side. It was so sudden. Everyone wasn’t even got a breath to process what had happened. And this for sure was an unprecedented move ever since Patriarch Ghalim suddenly fell ill and retreated from the political scene.</p>\n<p>Just as one side was busy completing the first stage to win over the Young Lady of Malikh Family, the other side already won over Young Lady of the noble Blackwood Family. All happened in a span of a single day.</p>\n<p>“Y-young Lady Lyla…”</p>\n<p>Even Butler Tim couldn’t pull his own young miss seeing how happy she was. His plan had been jabbed in a completely unexpected way. Maybe he wasn’t so smart after all.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>It was unfortunate that Madam Malikh didn’t see the Young Noble Miss of Blackwood Family kindly. Even though the girl did nothing wrong, Madam Malikh wasn’t so muddled that she wasn’t aware what Blackwood Family and those corrupt elders conspiring against her husband and Malikh’s main family. Even Bhela herself couldn’t do anything to change her mother’s mind.</p>\n<p>However, Lyla Blackwood, an airhead as she always was, was oblivious of the hostility directed toward her.</p>\n<p>It was morning the second day Lyla in Badril Village. Following her friend Bhela, she carried a little box inside Patriarch Ghalim’s bedroom. This little box filled with custom-made medicines--most were amateurly mixed from two different trivial medicines, consisted of remedies for flu and headache. Nothing harmful but nothing useful at the same time. And just like yesterday, to pay for Bhela parents’ kindness for letting her staying in Malikh Family, Lyla Blackwood decided to play doctor a little bit.</p>\n<p>“Uncle, I’m coming again to help you feel better,” Lyla said as she dragged a chair and sat beside Patriarch Ghalim’s sick bed. Seeing the pale middle-aged man in bed, she blinked her googly eyes, then continued, “how’s yesterday medicine I gave you. Are you feeling a tiny minny bit better, perhaps?”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim certainly was feeling better these past few days, not because Lyla’s medicines, but Grandpa Piss’s diagnosis and remedies. Toward this girl, he weakly nodded. “Thank you for your help, little lady.”</p>\n<p>“Then I’m going to fed you my newest recipe, uncle. Here, here, open your mouth.”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghamil did what he was told. Because Lyla didn’t like bitter medicine, she added lots of brown sugar. Lots and lots of brown sugar.</p>\n<p>“It’s… sweet.”</p>\n<p>“Are you feeling better, now?” Lyla asked.</p>\n<p>“Yes, little lady, I’m feeling better.”</p>\n<p>As a matter of fact, he wasn’t. The medicine was more like a candy than remedy.</p>\n<p>“Good! If you eat this three times a day, maybe your illness would go away, uncle,” Lyla then sternly pointed out, “maybe!”</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh was nervous when her husband consumed the strange medicine Lyla gave him, but she didn’t open her mouth to protest. Bhela was changing the pillows’ sheet nearby, and doing some other chores that usually were done by the servants. In the meantime, Lyla was giving advice for Patriarch Ghalim liked how he should eat moderately three times a day, how he should brush his teeth after he ate sweets, and all the things Aunt Jiji told Lyla all the time.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to visit again, uncle, get well soon!” Lyla waved her hands. Carrying a broom in her hands, Lyla’s next schedule was following Bhela doing chores in the courtyard.</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim weakly waved his hand back. Of course, after the girls were already gone, he noticed his bitter wife biting her lips indignantly.</p>\n<p>“Don’t stare the girl so much. She’s not responsible for her family’s wrongdoings. It’s not like a girl her age knows what her parents do behind the scene.”</p>\n<p>“Why did you eat that? What if they used her to give you more poison?”</p>\n<p>“Bhela wouldn’t let me have the medicine if she didn’t what it was, no? Stop putting that kind of face, you only make our daughter feels awkward about all this.”</p>\n<p>The woman held her husband’s hand, kissing it with her forehead as she hid her face. She whispered, “Oh, don’t you know how hurt this heart holding back my grievance? Why did our daughter had to bring someone from that family inside our roof?” she sniffed, “how long this farce gonna last? What should I do in the mean time? Oh! I don’t know! I don’t know!”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim sighed as he witnessed his wife cried helplessly.</p>\n<p>In the courtyard, near the coops where Malikh Family raised chickens and ducks, Lyla was squatting in front of the new bunny she and Bhela bought just yesterday. She was waiting the whole morning just to feed this bunny. The bunny hopped around, itching to play in spite it couldn’t resist the temptation of delicious green leaves, again and again. Wathing how glutton the bunny was, Lyla found herself immerse in immense joy. She very much envying the life of a bunny. Perhaps that because she could relate to how it spent its day without worry; eating, playing, sleeping, then playing again--a life that she longed to have. If only she was born a rabbit instead of a young lady of noble family….</p>\n<p>The sound of the broom swept the ground took away her attention. Lyla couldn’t understand how a daughter of a patriarch like Bhela had to work so much.</p>\n<p>“Why do you work so much, Sistah?” Lyla asked when she found out there still much dry leaves Bhela had to sweep. “Won’t you get bored soon? Just let the servants clean this place.”</p>\n<p>Bhela, sweeping as if Lyla’s idleness didn’t bother her the slightest, replied, “Here in Badril Village, everyone who hasn’t done their coming of age ceremony has to do chores for their parents. It doesn’t matter if it’s the farmer’s daughter or the biggest family’s young lady, helping the matter of the household is one of the seven virtues we Mossack people get to do for our parents.”</p>\n<p>Originally, Lyla wanted her friend also playing with the bunny. But hearing Bhela just said something serious, there was no way she’d reveal her intention now. “My mom always nagging me to go to dance lesson or whatever. It’s very very boring,” she murmured, a bit dejected.</p>\n<p>“The west and the south have different values,” Bhela said. “Complete your virtue for your parents then you’ll grow to be a fine lady, Lyla.”</p>\n<p>“Uggghhh…” Lyla grunted as she didn’t want to continue the topic any further. She long developed a sense for her own survival to detect whether or not the conversation ended up she being forced to do some boring stuff. Knowing Bhela’s personality, Lyla knew soon Sis Bhela’d make her doing chores too. Grabbing the bunny, Lyla quickly escaped somewhere else so that she could spend her time playing. Bhela shook her head seeing the girl’s behavior.</p>\n<p>Bhela then noticed some servants whispering while they looking at Lyla from the distance. Many people were curious what a noble young lady like her would do in a rural place like this, and Bhela wasn’t that oblivious not to notice the eyes planted by the elders of Malikh Family.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, she then saw four girls dressed in expensive garments approaching Lyla with their mouth covered with feathered fans in their hands. Their clothing looked as if they attending some sort of ceremony, while in fact, they calculated that this kind of appearance was the most suitable for them to socialize with a girl of blue-blooded origin. Bhela recognized the leader of those girls was actually Elder Jhamil’s niece.</p>\n<p>“Have you read Le Armour dan Varoza written by Leornador De Gonzalez, Young Lady Blackwood?”</p>\n<p>“Ah, yes, that piece was adequately sophisticated but I think Vista van Gracious’s omnibus more than adequate, le banjour?”</p>\n<p>“I see, I see, their pieces adequately well-written as those senor themselves adequattely live as maestro. But perhaps equoliette more than fit the diagram as paradigm sensorita abligioate senor des adequately le banjour.”</p>\n<p>“But of course, Young Lady Blackwood is more addequately sophisitacted as it’s a noblesse obligiote to be more sohpisitacated than us village senioritas. Perhaps le banjour is fortuna with de gracious by Young Lady’s great wisdom?”</p>\n<p>Lyla blinked her eyes trying to decipher whatever these girls mean. The bunny in her arms even escaped amidst her confusion.</p>\n<p>“Uhh… uhhh…” Lyla timidly stepped back from the feathered fan girls. “I think Sis Bhela is calling me…”</p>\n<p>She swiftly ran away back to her friend Bhela.</p>\n<p>“Sistah, Sistah Bhela!” Lyla cried and grabbing Bhela’s sloven sleeve tightly, demanding for justice, “they came to bully me!”</p>\n<p>“What did they do?” Bhela asked.</p>\n<p>“They know I can’t speak western language! They came to test me! They’re even worse than those rich girls in seminar--they jumble some western mumbo jumbo into plain language in order to confuse me! They must be laughing and call me stupid by now!”</p>\n<p>Hearing Lyla’s grievance, Bhela patted her head in order to let the girl calmed down.</p>\n<p>“Lyla, those girls are different than the noble girls that always making fun of you.”</p>\n<p>“Different? How so?”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at the girls who also was watching them back while fanning themselves with their fabulous feathered fans.</p>\n<p>“They looked like noble descendants, but actually were not.”</p>\n<p>“I still don’t like them nonetheless!”</p>\n<p>“You don’t have to talk to them if you don’t want to,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>Yet Lyla still restlessly tugging Bhela’s sleeves, making it harder for her to do her chores. Before the peers that always making fun of her, Lyla was always helpless and had been depending on Bhela’s figure as a shield. What it looked like from the point of view of an outsider was a scene where a young mother being tested of her patience dealing with a girl who was throwing a tantrum.</p>\n<p>Seeing that the young noble miss wouldn’t come back soon, the feathered fan girls approaching Bhela and Lyla instead.</p>\n<p>“Oh, fancy to meet Young Lady Bhela here, le banjour!”</p>\n<p>“Le bonjour…” Bhela hesitated to reply back. Tilting her head slightly, she studied the pompously dressed girls before her. These girls were relatives of Malikh Family’s elders. None of them could match with Bhela if talking strictly about social status wise, not to mention talents. However, while she was holding her broom, it looked like Bhela was the one with common origin, while these girls were floating swans who happened to be generous enough to greet plebeians with their <em>unique</em> vocabulary.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Lyla Blackwood hid behind Lyla’s back. Despite a noble origin herself, meeting more cocky and fake young ladies than the girls before her were rare experience for Lyla.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela, fancy to meet you. Good morning. The weather is nice. I eat snails everyday,” Elder Jhamil’s niece took the lead and said that with a hint of inflated pride.</p>\n<p>Bhela narrowed her eyes. She could see why Lyla instantly hated these girls. She then said in a sleek foreign language, “Je ne sais pas de quoi tu parles. Si vous ne parlez pas une langue étrangère, fermez simplement la bouche, sinon vous faites peur aux enfants avec votre non-sens.”</p>\n<p>The feathered fan girls blinked their eyes trying to decipher whatever Bhela had said.</p>\n<p>“Oh, it turns out Young Lady Bhela is aquadettely know some le banjour!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, Young Lady Bhela is adequately sophisticated after all. Me gusta!”</p>\n<p>“I see, I see, le pasta fortuna is delicosaza.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s niece didn’t say anything as she only maintained a sweet smile while being nervous herself. Racking her brains over remembering the contents of thick dictionary, she tried to form a decent sentences in foreign language. But Bhela then cut off her train of thought before she could say a word.</p>\n<p>“Blackwood Family is migrating noble that has long been making their roots here in southern land. Hundred of years living far away from their western peers, noble families like this would naturally become more lax. It’s natural for Lyla to not mastering her homeland’s native tongue.”</p>\n<p>Bhela said that in a straight manner. That was a white lie, however. It was true that many noble families coming from the western side of Tiramikal Continent to forgot their western root and began to see themselves as southerners. But those were usually the case depending right circumstances, like exiled nobles, or some young masters who had lost in political battle branched out and fancied themselves a legit noble family with themselves at the helm. Blackwood Family weren’t exiled nobles, and though Lyla’s ancestors branching out some hundreds of years ago, that didn’t automatically made them cutting off ties with the original family. The main family of Blackwood was back in a western country called Tatalghia Kingdom, still sending letters and envoys from time to time to the branch Lyla was living in--although, undeniably, the southern branch of Blackwood Family had long developed and surpassed the main one.</p>\n<p>It seemed like Bhela already used to tell this lie. Anyone who heard this would be forced to accept it, unless they wanted to spend time and resources digging through the details--which to be honest, none of these pompous young girls were willing or simply unable to go through.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Elder Jhamil’s niece believed Lyla’s family exempt her to excel in foreign language. Yet she was still displeased inside. Her uncle told her that Bhela had been hogging the young noble’s influence for herself, everyone in Malikh Family already knew how Bhela Malikh carrying around the noble young lady yesterday. So what if she had some more bit of talent and had been running around overseas in that whatever seminars she was attending? A bumpkin origin wouldn’t be able to change their bumpkin bloodline. So if Bhela had the right to get close with the Young Lady of Blackwood Family, that meant someone coming from the same family should have the same change as her!</p>\n<p>The elder’s niece said, “Young Lady Bhela, I know the main family is prideful. But Young Lady Blackwood is here to experience the village slow life. Don’t you think she also needs to mingle with us commoners?”</p>\n<p>“Lyla will befriend any person she fancies herself, I don’t control with whom she wants to socialize with,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“If that’s the case, then why she still has no friends other than you?”</p>\n<p>“That’s not true!” Lyla cried indignantly, “I’ve made friends! With aunties! Aunties in the kitchen!”</p>\n<p>It was easy to be friendly with Lyla. She was always unconventional and never saw people by the social system. To her, people only divided by two types, those who gave her food and those who didn’t. She was like a cat. Just bring a good food and she’d be very friendly the next moment.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Lyla’s frank open-mindedness wasn’t easily accepted by some people. Elder Jhamil’s niece gasped as she looked at Lyla and Bhela, back and forth. “My goodness! Young Lady Bhela, were you letting a noble young lady such as Young Lady Blackwood mingle with dirty servants?!”</p>\n<p>“Why wouldn’t I?” Bhela asked back.</p>\n<p>“You--don’t young lady care about our family’s reputation? What if people said we’ve mistreated a noble young lady?”</p>\n<p>“Lyla is here to experience village slow life,” Bhela said slowly, “don’t you think she also needs to mingle with commoners?”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s niece was speechless as Bhela used her own words. The contorted expression on her chaky make-up face brought satisfaction for Lyla, who then snorted.</p>\n<p>“What now? Kitty got your tongue?” Lyla said with her mouth pouted. “So that you know, Sis Bhela already made speechless many many bullies like you! Who were many many many times smarter than you! This is what you get by making fun of me--shame on you, hmph! Who’s the stupid one, now?”</p>\n<p>Even after losing a round of squabble against Young Lady Bhela, unexpectedly the nobly young lady herself became hostile against her. All was so sudden that it made blood drained from her face.</p>\n<p>Bhela ruffled Lyla’s hair. Apparently Lyla still believed these girls came to bully her. When Lyla already made up her mind to not liking someone, it was hard to bend on her opinion.</p>\n<p>“Let’s go, Lyla. We’ll help aunties make sweets for afternoon lunch,” Bhela said. Back in the seminars, when Bhela asked Lyla to do some chores, the supposed noble young lady of Blackwood Family would move slowly, occasionally pouting and murmuring some complaints, unwilling to exert her calories on some boring stuff. However, it was different if the destination was kitchen. The spirit of lively bunny would come to possess her--she’d jolt, sprinting, unwilling to waste time as the promise of free sweets and delicious salty snacks was revealed before her.</p>\n<p>“What was that about?!” one of the le bonjour girls scowled after Bhela and Lyla was gone. “How could a young lady speaks like that?”</p>\n<p>“Bhela must lead her around to act like that! Did you hear what she said? The noble young lady thinks we bully her or something.”</p>\n<p>“Aahhh! What a manipulative bitch! I really want to know what that little cunt said to make Young Lady Blackwood think we had made fun of her. No way in hell someone would dare making fun of a noble like her!”</p>\n<p>Actually, Lyla was made fun of so many times. Especially during her study in the seminars abroad. She made fun of so much that she formed a survival instinct to hide behind Bhela’s back. But they didn’t know that. They just assumed as a young lady coming from a noble family, Lyla Blackwood would be adequately pure noble in stories and gossip. The main reason Bhela brought Lyla away was so that Lyla didn’t have to mingle with these delusional le bonjour girls.</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-5/chapter-1-5":"<p>A fifteen years old boy played a game of chess against a spirit. Yesterday, he won a ghastly old encyclopedia nobody ever heard of. Today, the bet he eyed was silver coins. He didn’t know what he wanted from his opponent for tomorrow’s game. But the spirit in this dashing leather armor, adventurer-style, always wanted one thing for the game’s prize: taking control of the boy’s mortal body.</p>\n<p>More than a hundred games of chess later, the boy still got his healthy body intact, he never lost even once. And that made the spirit grow more dissatisfied as the days passing by.</p>\n<p>“Holy ff--! I clearly remember this damn bishop wasn’t there,” the spirit said. From the look of it, he was two moves away from getting his king owned.</p>\n<p>The boy clicked his tongue. He was hearing that kind of excuse every time the chess game came to its end.</p>\n<p>The spirit stubbornly closed the gap in his defense by sacrificing a rook. But soon, without taking a time to think, the boy casually moved his one horse, eating away the queen, sealing all the chance for the spirit to counter-attack.</p>\n<p>“Fuck this shit!!!”</p>\n<p>Enraged, the spirit flipped the chess board. About a dozen chess pieces hurled all side as they became the victims of the spirit’s frustration. The boy sighed. This was no good. Apparently he needed to be more considerate for the next game. He needed to pretend struggling before he crushed this impatient spirit so he didn’t feel cornered and ended up abandoning all these easy-money making games.</p>\n<p>“Hey,” the boy said. He tapped the flat-surfaced stone they used to lay the chess board before and reminded the spirit, almost as if he was saying “put the money here.”</p>\n<p>As annoyed as he was, the spirit could do nothing but give him a pouch of coins.</p>\n<p>“They are not kobes,” the boy said. “Shops and stalls in the village only accept kobe coins.”</p>\n<p>The spirit scoffed.</p>\n<p>“What do you know about it, brat. If you convert with the last week rate then you’ve got twice the shitty kobe you extort from me. Be glad about it.”</p>\n<p>“This won’t do, Ol’ Nalaq. The peddlers that come around here rarely accept strange currency. Neighbor country’s money is usually fine but I don’t think these coins would do. I don’t even know which country these coins are from.”</p>\n<p>“Then use it to add your savings,” the spirit said. “And don’t call me Nalaq. Don’t push your primitive tribal nonsense to me. Call me ‘Good-Natured Spirit’ as usual. I’m not like your usual Nalaqs, brat.”</p>\n<p>“It’s not tribal.” The boy didn’t show any sign of agreement. He didn’t know why this roguish-grinning spirit didn’t like to be called a Nalaq. The way southern Mossack people, like the boy himself, addressed spirits were usually by two terms: Nalaq and Selaq. As far as he knew Nalaq was a title worth to be proud of.</p>\n<novel-trivia label=”Lore”>\n<p>Nalaq were those of the spirit of fallen heroes and mages, had attained high-level of enlightenment to see ways to preserve souls across death. Whilst no longer to be alive, Nalaqs own their consciousness and retain their memories as well intelligence, though part of their original power diminished, especially those who relied on physical might during their prime.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Selaqs arose from death through unnatural causes, sometimes fueled by resentment and great energy of negativity. Though more powerful, their spirit didn’t dissipate because of strong, usually vile, emotions their harbour when they died, the restless spirits stuck in the limbo and returned back to the mortal world as hostile, mindless haunting spectres.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>Theoretically the spirit that currently playing chess was a Nalaq. He still got his consciousness, true. But, in a way, his intelligence seemed way apart from the Nalaqs southern Mossack tribes often revered in the past--that was what the boy had in mind when looking at this vulgar grinning spirit.</p>\n<p>“You’re not thinking something stupid about me, are you?” the spirit said with a snort as he realized the unexcited eyes the boy had as if he was looking at cow dung.</p>\n<p>“No, I was thinking just the usual--I was wondering about your very existence and your real identity.”</p>\n<p>“That so?” the spirit raised his chin. “Don’t need overthinking it, boy. Hehe. If you know even a piece of my name then you’d be amazed by how amazing I am. Everybody is my bitch when I’m still your age back then, hehe. That’s true.”</p>\n<p>“Hooohhh…” the boy half-heartedly nodded. As expected, every time he brought the topic about the spirit’s identity, all he got was empty talks, disgusting enough for him to regret for bringing up the topic. For now, the only joyous thing he got to do was counting the money he won from the chess game as the bullshit Good-Natured Spirit sang about his past tuning endlessly in the background.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Somewhere in Tiramikal Continent, far in the opposite side of the cold, barbaric northern lands, not too isolated from the bustling early-capitalistic empires of the western lands, and not too far away from the neighbor eastern lands of never-ending warfares between the eastern Kaya feudal lords, a village known as Badril Village was living peaceful for a number of years. The old blood the locals knew as Badril Village’s three big families rooted deeply these past one hundred years in spite of the thinning southern Mossack heritage. Despite slowly developing their rural village worthy of the westerner tourists and easterners refugees, the southern locals still taking pride in their Mossack hunters and gatherers ancestry. Exactly one year ago Good-Natured Spirit appeared in this humble village.󠆞</p>\n<p>On the wall of Yashura Family’s courtyard, which was ridiculously thick and tall for ordinary villages, the spirit took out a rolled paper of dried tobacco. This might not be common knowledge known only to limited people; for converting earthly materials to spiritual goods for Nalaqs to use, it could only be done in an expensive and complicated manner--usually performed in rituals by the royalties and great ancient clans for annual offerings to their ancestors. But the spirit in shabby leather armor did the converting for cigarettes and other trivial goods. Nobody knew how he did it. Even if they did, it’d be very hard to judge whether his quirk was worth to be admired or to be ridiculed at. Nevertheless he got this kind of air around him that telling people he didn’t care much about what they think.</p>\n<p>The street below the wall were children below ages of ten playing with sticks and chasing each other. When a crowd of housewives came, his eyes, sharp as an eagle’s, sweeping through in search of prey. One of his habit that obviously he brought with him since he was alive was to oogle women, especially for young wives and pretty middle-aged aunties interesting big breasts and interesting big butts. Despite his sighing and occasional annoying tongue-clicking, though, those wives and children didn’t turn their heads toward him. They didn’t even know a lecher ghost was there haunting the street. A Nalaq couldn’t be seen by common folks by default. Unless he wanted to, no one would realize there was a suspicious spirit ogling for women that were passing by.</p>\n<p>There was a young woman he knew trotted the street. Good-Natured Spirit knew her. She was neither a wife nor she was an aunty. Her butt and breasts sizes were also not worth being fusing about. The name was Mila Yashura, seventeen years old since last month. She was the older cousin of the boy he lost playing chess to.</p>\n<p>“Aunty,” Mila greeted an aunty by lowering her head, “did you see my cousin Shira around here?”</p>\n<p>The local wife she asked shook her head. Mila Yashura said a polite thanks and continued searching for her cousin.</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit swept the street with his eyes, looking for something. When he saw a certain manservant he stopped. Using his spiritual knife, he dismantled a small pebble from the stone wall he sat on, flicked it using his thumb and knocked the manservant’s head with it.</p>\n<p>“Ouch!” the manservant cried.</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura abruptly turned her head and saw a manservant of her Yashura Family holding his head. She briskly coming to him and asked the same question she threw to the aunty before.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira?” the manservant glanced at the direction of the hill behind Yashura Family’s wall. “I saw him walking there at noon. But whether he has returned or not I don’t know.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you. That’s good enough. Here, treat yourself some coffee beans before the peddlers set for the next village.”</p>\n<p>The hill behind the Yashura Family’s dwelling was originally a place where the family members brought the family’s goats to graze its green grasses. But under the current patriarch’s management, the family’s fortunate mostly put on investing on coconut plantations, thus some grazing places were left unused.</p>\n<p>“Shira! So here’s you holing yourself. I’ve been searching you for nearly an hour,” Mila saw how her cousin who was two years younger than her enjoying himself lying under a shadowy tree, using his arms as pillows. She kicked his foot, yelling him to get up, but Shira merely changed his position and groaned in protest.</p>\n<p>“This buffon…” Mila hissed. “You know how the fact you’re lazing around everyday breeds all those crappy rumors, don’t you?”</p>\n<p>“People can talk whatever they want as long as they don’t bother me,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“But they bother our family!”</p>\n<p>Mila inhaling a deep breath. Now her voice getting higher annoyingly and she continued, “You’re the young master of our family, you lazy pig. The nearest in-line to inherit the patriarch title! You may don’t give a shit about your reputation now but if you are to take the leader's mantle from my father then all the crap they said would certainly bite your ass in the future! You hear?!”</p>\n<p>Shira picked his ear coolly. He might not know anything about the future, but certainly his cousin’s annoying nagging was biting his ass at this moment.</p>\n<p>“What are you doing alone in this kind of place anyway?”</p>\n<p>“You might not believe it, but I’m making a fortune here,” Shira said. Of course, whenever he played a game of chess with a spirit invisible to ordinary humans, he needed a quiet place where nobody was around. This was a perfect place for him.</p>\n<p>But Mila winced her eyes. A few seconds later, she turned her head, catching a canvas filled with rough sketches resting on the tree.</p>\n<p>“By painting?”</p>\n<p>“Sometimes that too.” Shira knew a bit about drawing scenery and people, so even with his limited interpersonal connection as an introvert he could make some money with his painting. However, his casual reply got Mila in a bad mood instead. Suddenly Shira remembered the embarrassing accident two months ago when Mila found an unfinished commision from a certain good-for-nothing spirit that he had carefully hidden in his house. When people commissioned a no-name painter they mostly asked for a portrait or image they deemed interesting. What kind of images Good-Natured Spirit found interesting? Women, of course. Especially those with big butts and big breasts. He liked them in thin, slipping clothings as if those vulnerable ladies were stuck in a very dangerous situation. In other words, erotic paintings.</p>\n<p>Then, sighing at the explosive nagging coming his way, Shira took a stick he slipped on his right ear and presented it as a bribe. Ancient southern Mossacks used berries and some used squid inks as pigments, but after waves of outside influence they started using quills and brushes, depending on the regions. Pencils, although practical, were introduced by a certain Nalaq spirit and Shira hadn’t heard anyone using it beside himself. The stick he used as a bribe was exactly a pencil. It sharpened many times and half-way on its way before he needed another one. Shira thought, maybe he should extort some more pencils for the next match from Good-Natured Spirit.</p>\n<p>Mila furrowed. She knew about the pencil and its value not too long ago thus, as expected, she grabbed it shamelessly. “What? Do you think you can escape only with this?”</p>\n<p>“I planned to give you something else but I think you’d rather like this simple bribe anyway.”</p>\n<p>Shira wanted to simply give her money to make her shut up. But the coins he had on him now only in form of foreign currency--the coins he extorted from Good-Natured Spirit from the last chess game. The boy frowned. Beside nagging him at full force, what did Mila coming here for?</p>\n<p>“Yeah, that reminds me, the news I wanted to tell you!” Mila finally snapped out of her nagging mode. “That Malikh girl! Your fiancée! After two years abroad! She’s finally coming home!”</p>\n<p>“Ohh…” the reply was anticlimactic.</p>\n<p>“Ohh? What the fuck with that reply?”</p>\n<p>“You don’t mind me. I just already burn out when people compare me with her,” Shira said. Although their age were the same, this young lady of Malikh Family was famous even in the nearby villages and town as a talent, with a promising look that might make her a beauty worth dying for. The old generations called her treasure and the boys loved her as the village princess. She went abroad two years ago for a series of seminars after an official from the capital scouted her talent. Now that she returned, everybody was fervently talking about her. But for Shira Yashura, the boy who was supposed to be the fiancé, even that kind of news wasn’t enough to make him get up from his comfortable napping.</p>\n<p>“My father wants to talk with you,” Mila said, “get up now.”</p>\n<p>“What about?”</p>\n<p>“You still asking?”</p>\n<p>The boy had a premonition that a troublesome matter would be waiting for him. Mila gave him an ultimatum before she wandered off to do her own things.</p>\n<p>“Hehe, what’s this fiancée I heard just now?” Good-Natured Spirit popped out his head from a tree beside Shira.</p>\n<p>“It’s not what you think,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“Oh yeah?” Good-Natured Spirit nudged the boy with his elbow. “I heard that chick is a hella beauty. Hehe, I bet her luggages is in good-quality, you know what I mean?”</p>\n<p>“From whom did you hear that?”</p>\n<p>“Doesn’t matter who. When it comes to chick my radar is very sensitive, eh. I’m curious. Did you benefit from this engagement thingy? Benefit, know what I mean?”</p>\n<p>Shira clicked his tongue. “Like I said, it’s not what you think it is. Our parents set us up and it’s been a mess since the talks about engagement got out.”</p>\n<p>Talking some sense to this good-for-nothing Nalaq was futile. Good-Natured Spirit kept teasing him. “You haven’t seen her for two years, have you? The talks I’ve been hearing down there real hairy, brat. I mean… especially those luggages of hers, know what I mean? Know what I mean? Nudge nudge. Nudge nudge,” he winked. “Wanna check on her?”</p>\n<p>“I need to go back. My uncle wants to talk with me.”</p>\n<p>“Alright then,” Good-Natured Spirit nodded as he rubbed his chin. “I’ll check the chick myself.”</p>\n<p>Carrying the canvas and the chess with him, Shira warned the Nalaq, “You better not do anything funny to her, hear me?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho. Jealous?”</p>\n<p>“I just don’t want their entire family coming right after me with pitchforks just because yo do something stupid.”</p>\n<p>After he said that Shira Yashura turned around. He started to walk down the hill. Good-Natured Spirit saw the boy walk without caring for the world, then he set off to check the girl by himself with a chuckle that escaped from his mouth.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A few hours later the said fiancée showed herself in a public training field. The field, owned by the most influential family in Badril Village--the Elzhier Family--was neatly arranged with archery targets and provided with dulled swords for the teenagers trained themselves or doing mock battles. The Elzhiers sent some menservants occasionally to act as security in case conflicts would occur. Today, the young master of the said family himself, nicknamed Bony, guarded the entrance along with two of his lackeys.</p>\n<p>“I’ve got to pay you to enter?!” a young man gawked at the sudden irregularity regarding the training field’s rules. “What’s this? The field is supposed to be free for everyone!”</p>\n<p>“Well, man, gotta pay for maintenance cost,” one of the lackeys, called Pilek, said as he rubbed his nose.</p>\n<p>“One silver kobe! Heh, maintenance cost my ass! Nobody would pay for this bullshit.”</p>\n<p>“Nobody? You wrong, man,” another lackey called Polio pointed at the crowd inside the training field with a gesture of his head. The girl from the Malikh Family causing a big ruckus from her arrival alone. She attracted boys like a bright lamp attracted fireflies. Because of that, the three deliquents in the entrance for nearly half an hour had been amassing quite a fortune till now.</p>\n<p>“I’ll definitely send complaints to Elzhier Family now. Just because your father is the village head you think you can do whatever you want, eh?” the young man snorted, sending a glare to them.</p>\n<p>The Elzhier Family’s young master, who had been watching with his back resting on the wall and his arms crossed, decided to open his mouth, he said, “Pay or get lost.”</p>\n<p>“Hear that? Boss Bony has spoken,” Pilek glared back at the young man with his head tilted. “Better get lost now or else…”</p>\n<p>“Or else!” Polio emphasized with a higher voice.</p>\n<p>The three of them had been infamous in the village despite being heirs to their respective families. Naturally, though they were the same age, only an idiot would butting head directly with the heir of Elzhier Family. Thus the young man snorted, unwillingly turned and walked away.</p>\n<p>“What the heck is that?” Pilek didn’t like the way that young man snorted at them. “We should teach bastards like him a few good lessons one of these days.”</p>\n<p>“You’re right,” Polio added.</p>\n<p>“Just ignore that bum,” Bony said.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, the next onlookers came. Not boys, but two girls to be exact. They carried bags of dirty clothes with them as they were on their way to wash the clothes at the river.</p>\n<p>“Well, I’d be damned,” one of the girls, a young lady named Romana, said, “I’ve been hearing about the rumors but looking at that Malikh girl, damn…. Look at how she did with her hair, Mila.”</p>\n<p>They could see what was happening in the field even from the entrance. The two girls looked at a certain girl who was surrounded by boys. The other girl, Mila Yashura, furrowed her brows at the current appearance of her cousin’s fiancée. She kept her mouth shut despite the anger on her eyes.</p>\n<p>“She cut her hair short despite being engaged to your cousin,” Romana said to Mila. “What’s that supposed to mean?”</p>\n<p>It was a custom of southern Mossack people for women to cut their hair short to tell the opposite sex they currently unavailable. Mostly widows who weren’t ready to be courted again chose to cut their hair that way. However, since the young lady of Malikh Family was currently engaged, the act of cutting her hair short was confusing to people.</p>\n<p>From the three delinquents who had been hearing their conversations, Pilek butted in, “Yo, ladies, don’t think too much about it. We southern people been foreigners with this fiancé-and-fiancée business. We practical people, y’know? Southerners the kind of people who would do it first then talking ‘bout marriage later. A chance she might not know what she was doing.”</p>\n<p>Romana rolled her eyes. Knowing Mila Yashura was here, she wished this stupid cheerful delinquent wouldn’t say what he had said. In fact, better for him to not open his mouth. She hated him whenever he opened his mouth and said pointless things.</p>\n<p>Her and Mila’s goal was to check about the rumor regarding the fiancée’s short hair. They didn’t have the intention to enter the training field and mingle with those crowdy horny boys, lest talking with these shameless thugs who clearly act as bandits.</p>\n<p>“Let’s go, Mila,” Romana whispered as she realized Mila had been glaring at the three delinquents. Moving her eyes from Mila, she looked at Bony who was in between his two lackeys. She whispered again, “you can’t fight him like you used to. He got a Knight class now. People said he can even fight another Knight with four level above him. Let’s just forget about it.”</p>\n<p>Last time Mila and Bony fought was three years ago. Her punch made his nose bleed but that was the end of it. It was a hot topic for a while and most didn’t know what happened but the long enmity between the two of them suddenly dropped cold and they had been avoiding each other. Seeing how the other party was quite well, Mila Yashura grimaced. They were Novices back then but now, after both of them ascended the first level barrier and got themselves class titles, there was no way a support-class Specialist like her could deliver that kind of punch again to his face.</p>\n<p>“Mm. Let’s go,” Mila said to Romana. No matter how brave and reckless she was, as a non-combatant talent, she knew better than to sow another discord with the village’s young generation’s strongest.</p>\n<p>Pilek, the most cheerful in Bony’s group, who was actually the most friendly, waved his hand to the girls as they walked away. Neither of them bothered with him.</p>\n<p>“Ahhh, my sister’s been avoiding me lately,” Pilek grumbled. Romana, Mila’s friend, was actually his half-sister from different mother. He was a proud big brother when they were young, until their mothers had a fight and his half-sister moved into a separate house.</p>\n<p>“Pilek,” Bony called.</p>\n<p>“Yes boss?”</p>\n<p>“You should’ve kept your mouth shut.”</p>\n<p>Pilek wryly smiled and nodded. Polio also thought his friend Pilek couldn’t read between the line. Although Pilek’s remark was well-intentioned, it’d just make things worse for Bony. The bad mood from back three years ago still left after taste that made him and her uncomfortable dealing with each other.</p>\n<p>After that, more people were coming to see the young lady of Malikh Family.</p>\n<p>The talks and speculations about her hair made the boys think she was dissatisfied with her engagement with Shira Yashura. Thus giving them hopes to snatch her away. It was no exaggeration to say that most of the boys fell for her, especially after they saw how the young lady grew beautifully. They surrounded this girl who had this icy expression on her face, though she herself greatly concentrated on holding a bow and an arrow, eyes straight to the archery target dozens of meters from her. She shot. And when the arrow hit splendidly, the boys would cheer and fawn all over her. The girl kept her face cold despite the flooding flattery coming at her way.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” a young man in his early twenty stepped forward from the bunch of admirers and confidently said, “I see you have this different aura about you. Something special that I can’t quite get my fingers on it, and I can’t help but feel curious about you.”</p>\n<p>That was supposed to be a pick-up line, but Bhela Malikh replied straightforwardly, “I changed. Now I’m Level 10 and not a Novice anymore.”</p>\n<p>“Oooohhhh!!” the crowd was surprised. Reaching the first barrier and got a class title at fifteen years old was the second time in these two decades. The first one was Bony. However, considering the girl was quite a talent enough for people in the capital to notice her, there was a high chance for her to snatch the crown as Badril Village’s young generation’s strongest from Bony sooner than everyone expected.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” the young man called for her attention again, despite his first attempt at hitting on her was an utter failure. “I see your beautiful sharp eyes and beautiful nimble hands and your beautiful pretty face. The class you’ve got must be… a beautiful <b>Archer</b>, right?”</p>\n<p>“I am an archer,” Bhela replied tight-lipped. Well, it was obvious when she picked a bow the first thing she arrived here.</p>\n<p>“Ah, a beautiful and talented Archer then! It’s a pity, though for such a fine beautiful flower like yourself to be thrown into a heap of cow dung…”</p>\n<p>The remark made Bhela Malikh raise her brows. She somehow could predict where the topic was going to be directed.</p>\n<p>“That stupid engagement is what I say! How could a diamond such as yourself be forced to marry a trash from Yashura Family?”</p>\n<p>He sighed like he pitied the harsh fate of the beauty. And though unlikeable as he was, the murmurs of the crowd seemingly agreed with him. At that point, someone said, “That’s true. Even my ten years old nephew is one Level above him. Such trash to become…”</p>\n<p>The words stopped, Bhela looked at the person who said that. “The one from Yashura Family--he’s still a Level 3 Novice?”</p>\n<p>It was someone else who replied to her question. “Ah, yes, he’s stuck and made no progress even since Young Lady Bhela went outside the village. Everyone calls him The Eternal Novice.”</p>\n<p>And this made her raised brows turned into a frown. Going by the crowd, for a Level 5 Novice by fifteen years old was already considered slow progress even by the standard of rural places like Badril Village. Mostly at that age the youngsters already reached Level 7, the diligent ones could reach Level 8 with hard work. Faster than that, not counting usage of an unreasonable amount of growth-hack potions--which most children from rich noble families did, could be considered a talent amongst the younger generation. However, to think of a boy one year before his own coming-of-age ceremony coming still stuck at such low-level talent, even though if he was the heir of Badril Village’s major families, people would still call him trash, even in public.</p>\n<p>“Ah, Young Lady Bhela! You don’t have to bother yourself with such eyesore trash. I know you’re troubled with the careless arrangement your father made, but if we put our mind to it, we can--”</p>\n<p>All was well until the young man put bad words about her father. Never did he expect that the girl would mercilessly retract her hand just before the tips of their fingers touched.</p>\n<p>“Please don’t pretend you were familiar with me,” that was what she said.</p>\n<p>The rain of snickers rang all around him. Despite him glaring left and right in an intimidating manner, there was no way for him to suppress the crowd from humiliating him further. At the time he realized the chance for him to court the Young Lady of Malikh Family, the sole daughter of the Malikh Family Patriarch, was pitifully close to nothing. Thus, in a moment of spontaneity, he thought of a scheme to save his face and sounded it with a flash of desperate smirk plastered on his face. He grabbed a bow and said, “I see Young Lady Bhela rather reserved toward us long friends after two years abroad. Hmm, yeah, this is a perfect chance, by the way. I’m an Archer too, see. So why not this senior teach you a thing or two? Seventy meters--perhaps a good learning experience for young lady, no?”</p>\n<p>The surrounding began chattering lively. It was obvious it was a challenge as Archers. And the young man’s smirk turned more and more confident at the girl’s unresponsiveness. No matter how much potential talent one had, time and experience playing a vital role in assessing one’s current performance whether she was Archer or Priest or Knight or other classes. Skills, abilities one acquired after reaching the first barrier and getting a new class title could only progress with constant tempering in battle and improved alongside one’s level. The young man was a Level 12 Archer. So theoretically, a Level 10 new Archer like Bhela Malikh would need a few more years before she could beat the opponent in a fair competition.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh was annoyed. She glared at the ones who were supposed to be guarding the field. But Bony and his lackeys were busy counting coins. For Bhela, the crowd were a bunch of stupid annoying busybodies who prevented her to train in peace. But for Bony and his lackeys the crowd was simply a bunch of gold mines.</p>\n<p>“Please watch closely how I do it, Young Lady Bhela. See my elbow? If you could do the same way I do it, I’m sure your archery skill would improve significantly.”</p>\n<p>No one really bothered with the ‘humble direction’ the young man spouted. Bhela didn’t spare him a glance. She looked straight to target seventy meters from where she was standing. Repressing his anger, the young man began to shoot three arrows one by one splendidly; the final one landed right in the center of the target that was marked in red dot.</p>\n<p>He was satisfied with the result. Glancing at the young lady, this young man wanted to utter more words to improve his image. However, right before he opened his mouth, he found Bhela already drew her arrow, released it, and it hit one arrow splendidly. Not just hitting the target, but an arrow the young man previously shot. The second was the same. And the final third arrow also hit the arrow on the red dot.</p>\n<p>What was that? She used a skill? The young man wanted to object but his tongue froze and his lips quivered. Did she use <b>Far Sight</b> skill that enhanced eye-sight a hundred of meters away? Did she use <b>Boost Accuracy</b>, the skill that was supposedly forbidden to be used in duel between Archers? To think of beating him, an Archer older than her and 2 Level right above her, in such a devastating manner… she must be cheating, right?</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” the defeated young man said weakly, “I didn’t use my mana between my shots.”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh nodded.</p>\n<p>“Neither was I.”</p>\n<p>With that, Bhela turned around and left the crowd of dumbfounded boys with steps full of grace. She approached the entrance, returned back the bow she used to the three delinquents who just let people mess with her training and said coldly, “If this is how the famous Young Master Elzhier manages his property, then there’s no need for me to come here again. Please excuse me.”</p>\n<p>Bony’s expression didn’t change much as he still crossed his arms and rested his back casually on the wall.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Pilek, the one received the returned bow from Bhela, waved his hand again and shouted, “Take care, princess!”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Because she couldn’t train her archery peacefully in public, Bhela returned back to Malikh Family and trained in her private training place.</p>\n<p>It was originally a backyard turned archery ground, made by Malikh Family Patriarch after knowing his daughter showed interest in archery. It was nothing fancy. It was spacious and good enough when she started with her first bow but now Bhela felt the place was lacking. At most, she had to live with the meager fifty meters range maximum. Therefore, the practice she had made a habit of had to wait.</p>\n<p>Therefore, Bhela Malikh decided to put her mind over something else than her usual practice instead.</p>\n<p>She drew a deep breath. A table was provided with dozens of arrows laid on top of it. Bhela picked four at the same time, nocked them on her bow string. She began to aim.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the air surrounding her changed. Her inexperience as a newly Novice-graduate showed by the obvious mana that leaked from the inside out. With naked eyes, her mana looked calm colorful haze that consisted of four bold colors, tangling and struggling with each other for dominance. Her eyelashes quivered. Channeling mana to cast a skill she yet had mastered felt like trying to stand on the raging sea waves while she herself was being a weak newborn.</p>\n<p><em>Whhhhuuuuushh--</em></p>\n<p><em>Shuuuhsh--</em></p>\n<p><em>Ssshhhuuuush--</em></p>\n<p><em>Wwhuuuussh!!</em></p>\n<p>The fastest arrow, coated with sparking yellow-colored mana, hit one of the targets at around forty meters range. But the others performed pitifully. The one infused with wet blue-colored mana didn’t even reach two-third of the desired range. The green-colored one, an arrow infused with mana that generated unstable wind trajectory flew far far away, as if it was getting swallowed by the sky, never to be seen again. The last one, the red-colored arrow, was horrifying. It hit the training ground fence instead the target. The bamboo fences suddenly set ablaze by raging flames as soon as the said arrow came into contact with them.</p>\n<p><em>Clap clap clap!</em></p>\n<p>Uninvited claps resounded across the training ground. On the wall Good-Natured Spirit clapping after watching a good spectacle. For getting hand claps from a Nalaq like him, naturally the level of talent Bhela showed just now was far beyond ordinary.</p>\n<p>“Thank you…” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>It appeared she knew beforehand the four-arrows skill she shot would make a mess. So she gathered the maidservants and made them extinguish the fences that started to burn into ashes. “Thank you, thank you for your hard work,” she said to a pair of maidservants who briskly went back and forth to kill the fire before its spread.</p>\n<p>“Ah! Young lady, what skill was that just now?” one of the maidservants gawked after the fire was extinguished.</p>\n<p>“That wasn’t just your ordinary Archer skill, was it?” added the other.</p>\n<p>Summoning a blazing fire just with an arrow and pure mana was unheard of. At least, the maidservants knew nobody in the village could do that.</p>\n<p>Bhela drank a glass of murky liquify herbs mixed with mint to cool down her manasphere. “It’s something I learned when I was away,” she said after putting down the glass on the tray her maid servants provided. She continued, “I still can’t master it, though.”</p>\n<p>She cast her eyes at the unharmed targets one by one. Shooting at forty meters range was still too much for her using four arrows at the same time. When the maidservants realized her difficulty, they encouraged her to simplify it and shoot one arrow at a time. However at their suggestion, Bhela shook her head. “It’s the requirement of this skill I’ve got to shoot four arrows,” she explained.</p>\n<p>The maidservants nodded at her words and apologized for their shallow suggestion.</p>\n<p>“Don’t mind that,” Bhela waved her hand. “There’s something I heard from people, by the way. Something about Young Master Yashura.”</p>\n<p>The two maidservants glanced at each other before one of them replied. “The rumor says… he holed up from the public’s view because he’s ashamed he can’t even become a Level 4 Novice.”</p>\n<p>“Are the Yashura Family elders still favoring him as the heir of Yashura Family Patriarch?”</p>\n<p>“We don’t know whether they still favor him or not. But Yashura Family always united in their standing. So unless the current Patriarch of Yashura Family has a son, the Young Master Shira Yashura will undoubtedly become the next patriarch.”</p>\n<p>“No rumors about the Yashura Family elders wavering then?”</p>\n<p>The maidservants shook their heads altogether.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela… apologize for giving you my shallow suggestion once again but…” one of the maidservants came near to Bhela and whispered, “With him as the heir, Yashura Family’s future will be bleak. Everyone in our family said your father’s bad condition is a bad omen for us mingling with those simple Yashuras. I’m very sorry if this sounds impudent--but you should’ve better cut ties with them before too late, young lady. Madam was too grieved by your father’s ill health to make decisions thus the only one who can save our Malikh Family is you.”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at the maidservant. The glint on her eyes changed.</p>\n<p>“There’s already a plan laid to help our Malikh Family,” that was all Bhela said. “You better not say something like that again. You lucky no one here beside me to hear you utter that kind of words.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you for your mercy, young lady! We are sorry for being impudent!”</p>\n<p>They decided to make it history with only the four of them who knew the previous conversation. The four of them; the young lady and two maid servants and one Nalaq spirit who came here uninvited.</p>\n<p>“It seems I just heard something I shouldn’t hear,” Good-Natured Spirit said while he rubbed his chin. He came here peeking. He didn’t have the intention to reveal himself while the girls below had a secret conversation ignorant of his presence.</p>\n<p>After that Bhela continued with light training. Good-Natured Spirit watched her doing simple shooting, she didn’t even use a slightest of her mana from then on. Yawning, Good-Natured Spirit stood up. Then he flew away from Malikh Family and began to look for some other interesting thing to sate his boredom.</p>\n<hr>\n<authors-note id=\"Radhy\">\n<p>Testing, testing.

Yesterday, he won a ghastly old encyclopedia nobody ever heard of. Today, the bet he eyed was silver coins. He didn’t know what he wanted from his opponent for tomorrow’s game. But the spirit in this dashing leather armor, adventurer-style, always wanted one thing for the game’s prize: taking control of the boy’s mortal body.</p>\n<p>More than a hundred games of chess later, the boy still got his healthy body intact, he never lost even once. And that made the spirit grow more dissatisfied as the days passing by.</p>\n<p>“Holy ff--! I clearly remember this damn bishop wasn’t there,” the spirit said. From the look of it, he was two moves away from getting his king owned.</p>\n<p>The boy clicked his tongue. He was hearing that kind of excuse every time the chess game came to its end.</p>\n<p>The spirit stubbornly closed the gap in his defense by sacrificing a rook. But soon, without taking a time to think, the boy casually moved his one horse, eating away the queen, sealing all the chance for the spirit to counter-attack.</p>\n<p>“Fuck this shit!!!”</p>\n<p>Enraged, the spirit flipped the chess board. About a dozen chess pieces hurled all side as they became the victims of the spirit’s frustration. The boy sighed. This was no good. Apparently he needed to be more considerate for the next game. He needed to pretend struggling before he crushed this impatient spirit so he didn’t feel cornered and ended up abandoning all these easy-money making games.</p>\n<p>“Hey,” the boy said. He tapped the flat-surfaced stone they used to lay the chess board before and reminded the spirit, almost as if he was saying “put the money here.”</p>\n<p>As annoyed as he was, the spirit could do nothing but give him a pouch of coins.</p>\n<p>“They are not kobes,” the boy said. “Shops and stalls in the village only accept kobe coins.”</p>\n<p>The spirit scoffed.</p>\n<p>“What do you know about it, brat. If you convert with the last week rate then you’ve got twice the shitty kobe you extort from me. Be glad about it.”</p>\n<p>“This won’t do, Ol’ Nalaq. The peddlers that come around here rarely accept strange currency. Neighbor country’s money is usually fine but I don’t think these coins would do. I don’t even know which country these coins are from.”</p>\n<p>“Then use it to add your savings,” the spirit said. “And don’t call me Nalaq. Don’t push your primitive tribal nonsense to me. Call me ‘Good-Natured Spirit’ as usual. I’m not like your usual Nalaqs, brat.”</p>\n<p>“It’s not tribal.” The boy didn’t show any sign of agreement. He didn’t know why this roguish-grinning spirit didn’t like to be called a Nalaq. The way southern Mossack people, like the boy himself, addressed spirits were usually by two terms: Nalaq and Selaq. As far as he knew Nalaq was a title worth to be proud of.</p>\n<novel-trivia label=”Lore”>\n<p>Nalaq were those of the spirit of fallen heroes and mages, had attained high-level of enlightenment to see ways to preserve souls across death. Whilst no longer to be alive, Nalaqs own their consciousness and retain their memories as well intelligence, though part of their original power diminished, especially those who relied on physical might during their prime.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Selaqs arose from death through unnatural causes, sometimes fueled by resentment and great energy of negativity. Though more powerful, their spirit didn’t dissipate because of strong, usually vile, emotions their harbour when they died, the restless spirits stuck in the limbo and returned back to the mortal world as hostile, mindless haunting spectres.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>Theoretically the spirit that currently playing chess was a Nalaq. He still got his consciousness, true. But, in a way, his intelligence seemed way apart from the Nalaqs southern Mossack tribes often revered in the past--that was what the boy had in mind when looking at this vulgar grinning spirit.</p>\n<p>“You’re not thinking something stupid about me, are you?” the spirit said with a snort as he realized the unexcited eyes the boy had as if he was looking at cow dung.</p>\n<p>“No, I was thinking just the usual--I was wondering about your very existence and your real identity.”</p>\n<p>“That so?” the spirit raised his chin. “Don’t need overthinking it, boy. Hehe. If you know even a piece of my name then you’d be amazed by how amazing I am. Everybody is my bitch when I’m still your age back then, hehe. That’s true.”</p>\n<p>“Hooohhh…” the boy half-heartedly nodded. As expected, every time he brought the topic about the spirit’s identity, all he got was empty talks, disgusting enough for him to regret for bringing up the topic. For now, the only joyous thing he got to do was counting the money he won from the chess game as the bullshit Good-Natured Spirit sang about his past tuning endlessly in the background.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Somewhere in Tiramikal Continent, far in the opposite side of the cold, barbaric northern lands, not too isolated from the bustling early-capitalistic empires of the western lands, and not too far away from the neighbor eastern lands of never-ending warfares between the eastern Kaya feudal lords, a village known as Badril Village was living peaceful for a number of years. The old blood the locals knew as Badril Village’s three big families rooted deeply these past one hundred years in spite of the thinning southern Mossack heritage. Despite slowly developing their rural village worthy of the westerner tourists and easterners refugees, the southern locals still taking pride in their Mossack hunters and gatherers ancestry. Exactly one year ago Good-Natured Spirit appeared in this humble village.󠆞</p>\n<p>On the wall of Yashura Family’s courtyard, which was ridiculously thick and tall for ordinary villages, the spirit took out a rolled paper of dried tobacco. This might not be common knowledge known only to limited people; for converting earthly materials to spiritual goods for Nalaqs to use, it could only be done in an expensive and complicated manner--usually performed in rituals by the royalties and great ancient clans for annual offerings to their ancestors. But the spirit in shabby leather armor did the converting for cigarettes and other trivial goods. Nobody knew how he did it. Even if they did, it’d be very hard to judge whether his quirk was worth to be admired or to be ridiculed at. Nevertheless he got this kind of air around him that telling people he didn’t care much about what they think.</p>\n<p>The street below the wall were children below ages of ten playing with sticks and chasing each other. When a crowd of housewives came, his eyes, sharp as an eagle’s, sweeping through in search of prey. One of his habit that obviously he brought with him since he was alive was to oogle women, especially for young wives and pretty middle-aged aunties interesting big breasts and interesting big butts. Despite his sighing and occasional annoying tongue-clicking, though, those wives and children didn’t turn their heads toward him. They didn’t even know a lecher ghost was there haunting the street. A Nalaq couldn’t be seen by common folks by default. Unless he wanted to, no one would realize there was a suspicious spirit ogling for women that were passing by.</p>\n<p>There was a young woman he knew trotted the street. Good-Natured Spirit knew her. She was neither a wife nor she was an aunty. Her butt and breasts sizes were also not worth being fusing about. The name was Mila Yashura, seventeen years old since last month. She was the older cousin of the boy he lost playing chess to.</p>\n<p>“Aunty,” Mila greeted an aunty by lowering her head, “did you see my cousin Shira around here?”</p>\n<p>The local wife she asked shook her head. Mila Yashura said a polite thanks and continued searching for her cousin.</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit swept the street with his eyes, looking for something. When he saw a certain manservant he stopped. Using his spiritual knife, he dismantled a small pebble from the stone wall he sat on, flicked it using his thumb and knocked the manservant’s head with it.</p>\n<p>“Ouch!” the manservant cried.</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura abruptly turned her head and saw a manservant of her Yashura Family holding his head. She briskly coming to him and asked the same question she threw to the aunty before.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira?” the manservant glanced at the direction of the hill behind Yashura Family’s wall. “I saw him walking there at noon. But whether he has returned or not I don’t know.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you. That’s good enough. Here, treat yourself some coffee beans before the peddlers set for the next village.”</p>\n<p>The hill behind the Yashura Family’s dwelling was originally a place where the family members brought the family’s goats to graze its green grasses. But under the current patriarch’s management, the family’s fortunate mostly put on investing on coconut plantations, thus some grazing places were left unused.</p>\n<p>“Shira! So here’s you holing yourself. I’ve been searching you for nearly an hour,” Mila saw how her cousin who was two years younger than her enjoying himself lying under a shadowy tree, using his arms as pillows. She kicked his foot, yelling him to get up, but Shira merely changed his position and groaned in protest.</p>\n<p>“This buffon…” Mila hissed. “You know how the fact you’re lazing around everyday breeds all those crappy rumors, don’t you?”</p>\n<p>“People can talk whatever they want as long as they don’t bother me,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“But they bother our family!”</p>\n<p>Mila inhaling a deep breath. Now her voice getting higher annoyingly and she continued, “You’re the young master of our family, you lazy pig. The nearest in-line to inherit the patriarch title! You may don’t give a shit about your reputation now but if you are to take the leader's mantle from my father then all the crap they said would certainly bite your ass in the future! You hear?!”</p>\n<p>Shira picked his ear coolly. He might not know anything about the future, but certainly his cousin’s annoying nagging was biting his ass at this moment.</p>\n<p>“What are you doing alone in this kind of place anyway?”</p>\n<p>“You might not believe it, but I’m making a fortune here,” Shira said. Of course, whenever he played a game of chess with a spirit invisible to ordinary humans, he needed a quiet place where nobody was around. This was a perfect place for him.</p>\n<p>But Mila winced her eyes. A few seconds later, she turned her head, catching a canvas filled with rough sketches resting on the tree.</p>\n<p>“By painting?”</p>\n<p>“Sometimes that too.” Shira knew a bit about drawing scenery and people, so even with his limited interpersonal connection as an introvert he could make some money with his painting. However, his casual reply got Mila in a bad mood instead. Suddenly Shira remembered the embarrassing accident two months ago when Mila found an unfinished commision from a certain good-for-nothing spirit that he had carefully hidden in his house. When people commissioned a no-name painter they mostly asked for a portrait or image they deemed interesting. What kind of images Good-Natured Spirit found interesting? Women, of course. Especially those with big butts and big breasts. He liked them in thin, slipping clothings as if those vulnerable ladies were stuck in a very dangerous situation. In other words, erotic paintings.</p>\n<p>Then, sighing at the explosive nagging coming his way, Shira took a stick he slipped on his right ear and presented it as a bribe. Ancient southern Mossacks used berries and some used squid inks as pigments, but after waves of outside influence they started using quills and brushes, depending on the regions. Pencils, although practical, were introduced by a certain Nalaq spirit and Shira hadn’t heard anyone using it beside himself. The stick he used as a bribe was exactly a pencil. It sharpened many times and half-way on its way before he needed another one. Shira thought, maybe he should extort some more pencils for the next match from Good-Natured Spirit.</p>\n<p>Mila furrowed. She knew about the pencil and its value not too long ago thus, as expected, she grabbed it shamelessly. “What? Do you think you can escape only with this?”</p>\n<p>“I planned to give you something else but I think you’d rather like this simple bribe anyway.”</p>\n<p>Shira wanted to simply give her money to make her shut up. But the coins he had on him now only in form of foreign currency--the coins he extorted from Good-Natured Spirit from the last chess game. The boy frowned. Beside nagging him at full force, what did Mila coming here for?</p>\n<p>“Yeah, that reminds me, the news I wanted to tell you!” Mila finally snapped out of her nagging mode. “That Malikh girl! Your fiancée! After two years abroad! She’s finally coming home!”</p>\n<p>“Ohh…” the reply was anticlimactic.</p>\n<p>“Ohh? What the fuck with that reply?”</p>\n<p>“You don’t mind me. I just already burn out when people compare me with her,” Shira said. Although their age were the same, this young lady of Malikh Family was famous even in the nearby villages and town as a talent, with a promising look that might make her a beauty worth dying for. The old generations called her treasure and the boys loved her as the village princess. She went abroad two years ago for a series of seminars after an official from the capital scouted her talent. Now that she returned, everybody was fervently talking about her. But for Shira Yashura, the boy who was supposed to be the fiancé, even that kind of news wasn’t enough to make him get up from his comfortable napping.</p>\n<p>“My father wants to talk with you,” Mila said, “get up now.”</p>\n<p>“What about?”</p>\n<p>“You still asking?”</p>\n<p>The boy had a premonition that a troublesome matter would be waiting for him. Mila gave him an ultimatum before she wandered off to do her own things.</p>\n<p>“Hehe, what’s this fiancée I heard just now?” Good-Natured Spirit popped out his head from a tree beside Shira.</p>\n<p>“It’s not what you think,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“Oh yeah?” Good-Natured Spirit nudged the boy with his elbow. “I heard that chick is a hella beauty. Hehe, I bet her luggages is in good-quality, you know what I mean?”</p>\n<p>“From whom did you hear that?”</p>\n<p>“Doesn’t matter who. When it comes to chick my radar is very sensitive, eh. I’m curious. Did you benefit from this engagement thingy? Benefit, know what I mean?”</p>\n<p>Shira clicked his tongue. “Like I said, it’s not what you think it is. Our parents set us up and it’s been a mess since the talks about engagement got out.”</p>\n<p>Talking some sense to this good-for-nothing Nalaq was futile. Good-Natured Spirit kept teasing him. “You haven’t seen her for two years, have you? The talks I’ve been hearing down there real hairy, brat. I mean… especially those luggages of hers, know what I mean? Know what I mean? Nudge nudge. Nudge nudge,” he winked. “Wanna check on her?”</p>\n<p>“I need to go back. My uncle wants to talk with me.”</p>\n<p>“Alright then,” Good-Natured Spirit nodded as he rubbed his chin. “I’ll check the chick myself.”</p>\n<p>Carrying the canvas and the chess with him, Shira warned the Nalaq, “You better not do anything funny to her, hear me?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho. Jealous?”</p>\n<p>“I just don’t want their entire family coming right after me with pitchforks just because yo do something stupid.”</p>\n<p>After he said that Shira Yashura turned around. He started to walk down the hill. Good-Natured Spirit saw the boy walk without caring for the world, then he set off to check the girl by himself with a chuckle that escaped from his mouth.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A few hours later the said fiancée showed herself in a public training field. The field, owned by the most influential family in Badril Village--the Elzhier Family--was neatly arranged with archery targets and provided with dulled swords for the teenagers trained themselves or doing mock battles. The Elzhiers sent some menservants occasionally to act as security in case conflicts would occur. Today, the young master of the said family himself, nicknamed Bony, guarded the entrance along with two of his lackeys.</p>\n<p>“I’ve got to pay you to enter?!” a young man gawked at the sudden irregularity regarding the training field’s rules. “What’s this? The field is supposed to be free for everyone!”</p>\n<p>“Well, man, gotta pay for maintenance cost,” one of the lackeys, called Pilek, said as he rubbed his nose.</p>\n<p>“One silver kobe! Heh, maintenance cost my ass! Nobody would pay for this bullshit.”</p>\n<p>“Nobody? You wrong, man,” another lackey called Polio pointed at the crowd inside the training field with a gesture of his head. The girl from the Malikh Family causing a big ruckus from her arrival alone. She attracted boys like a bright lamp attracted fireflies. Because of that, the three deliquents in the entrance for nearly half an hour had been amassing quite a fortune till now.</p>\n<p>“I’ll definitely send complaints to Elzhier Family now. Just because your father is the village head you think you can do whatever you want, eh?” the young man snorted, sending a glare to them.</p>\n<p>The Elzhier Family’s young master, who had been watching with his back resting on the wall and his arms crossed, decided to open his mouth, he said, “Pay or get lost.”</p>\n<p>“Hear that? Boss Bony has spoken,” Pilek glared back at the young man with his head tilted. “Better get lost now or else…”</p>\n<p>“Or else!” Polio emphasized with a higher voice.</p>\n<p>The three of them had been infamous in the village despite being heirs to their respective families. Naturally, though they were the same age, only an idiot would butting head directly with the heir of Elzhier Family. Thus the young man snorted, unwillingly turned and walked away.</p>\n<p>“What the heck is that?” Pilek didn’t like the way that young man snorted at them. “We should teach bastards like him a few good lessons one of these days.”</p>\n<p>“You’re right,” Polio added.</p>\n<p>“Just ignore that bum,” Bony said.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, the next onlookers came. Not boys, but two girls to be exact. They carried bags of dirty clothes with them as they were on their way to wash the clothes at the river.</p>\n<p>“Well, I’d be damned,” one of the girls, a young lady named Romana, said, “I’ve been hearing about the rumors but looking at that Malikh girl, damn…. Look at how she did with her hair, Mila.”</p>\n<p>They could see what was happening in the field even from the entrance. The two girls looked at a certain girl who was surrounded by boys. The other girl, Mila Yashura, furrowed her brows at the current appearance of her cousin’s fiancée. She kept her mouth shut despite the anger on her eyes.</p>\n<p>“She cut her hair short despite being engaged to your cousin,” Romana said to Mila. “What’s that supposed to mean?”</p>\n<p>It was a custom of southern Mossack people for women to cut their hair short to tell the opposite sex they currently unavailable. Mostly widows who weren’t ready to be courted again chose to cut their hair that way. However, since the young lady of Malikh Family was currently engaged, the act of cutting her hair short was confusing to people.</p>\n<p>From the three delinquents who had been hearing their conversations, Pilek butted in, “Yo, ladies, don’t think too much about it. We southern people been foreigners with this fiancé-and-fiancée business. We practical people, y’know? Southerners the kind of people who would do it first then talking ‘bout marriage later. A chance she might not know what she was doing.”</p>\n<p>Romana rolled her eyes. Knowing Mila Yashura was here, she wished this stupid cheerful delinquent wouldn’t say what he had said. In fact, better for him to not open his mouth. She hated him whenever he opened his mouth and said pointless things.</p>\n<p>Her and Mila’s goal was to check about the rumor regarding the fiancée’s short hair. They didn’t have the intention to enter the training field and mingle with those crowdy horny boys, lest talking with these shameless thugs who clearly act as bandits.</p>\n<p>“Let’s go, Mila,” Romana whispered as she realized Mila had been glaring at the three delinquents. Moving her eyes from Mila, she looked at Bony who was in between his two lackeys. She whispered again, “you can’t fight him like you used to. He got a Knight class now. People said he can even fight another Knight with four level above him. Let’s just forget about it.”</p>\n<p>Last time Mila and Bony fought was three years ago. Her punch made his nose bleed but that was the end of it. It was a hot topic for a while and most didn’t know what happened but the long enmity between the two of them suddenly dropped cold and they had been avoiding each other. Seeing how the other party was quite well, Mila Yashura grimaced. They were Novices back then but now, after both of them ascended the first level barrier and got themselves class titles, there was no way a support-class Specialist like her could deliver that kind of punch again to his face.</p>\n<p>“Mm. Let’s go,” Mila said to Romana. No matter how brave and reckless she was, as a non-combatant talent, she knew better than to sow another discord with the village’s young generation’s strongest.</p>\n<p>Pilek, the most cheerful in Bony’s group, who was actually the most friendly, waved his hand to the girls as they walked away. Neither of them bothered with him.</p>\n<p>“Ahhh, my sister’s been avoiding me lately,” Pilek grumbled. Romana, Mila’s friend, was actually his half-sister from different mother. He was a proud big brother when they were young, until their mothers had a fight and his half-sister moved into a separate house.</p>\n<p>“Pilek,” Bony called.</p>\n<p>“Yes boss?”</p>\n<p>“You should’ve kept your mouth shut.”</p>\n<p>Pilek wryly smiled and nodded. Polio also thought his friend Pilek couldn’t read between the line. Although Pilek’s remark was well-intentioned, it’d just make things worse for Bony. The bad mood from back three years ago still left after taste that made him and her uncomfortable dealing with each other.</p>\n<p>After that, more people were coming to see the young lady of Malikh Family.</p>\n<p>The talks and speculations about her hair made the boys think she was dissatisfied with her engagement with Shira Yashura. Thus giving them hopes to snatch her away. It was no exaggeration to say that most of the boys fell for her, especially after they saw how the young lady grew beautifully. They surrounded this girl who had this icy expression on her face, though she herself greatly concentrated on holding a bow and an arrow, eyes straight to the archery target dozens of meters from her. She shot. And when the arrow hit splendidly, the boys would cheer and fawn all over her. The girl kept her face cold despite the flooding flattery coming at her way.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” a young man in his early twenty stepped forward from the bunch of admirers and confidently said, “I see you have this different aura about you. Something special that I can’t quite get my fingers on it, and I can’t help but feel curious about you.”</p>\n<p>That was supposed to be a pick-up line, but Bhela Malikh replied straightforwardly, “I changed. Now I’m Level 10 and not a Novice anymore.”</p>\n<p>“Oooohhhh!!” the crowd was surprised. Reaching the first barrier and got a class title at fifteen years old was the second time in these two decades. The first one was Bony. However, considering the girl was quite a talent enough for people in the capital to notice her, there was a high chance for her to snatch the crown as Badril Village’s young generation’s strongest from Bony sooner than everyone expected.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” the young man called for her attention again, despite his first attempt at hitting on her was an utter failure. “I see your beautiful sharp eyes and beautiful nimble hands and your beautiful pretty face. The class you’ve got must be… a beautiful <b>Archer</b>, right?”</p>\n<p>“I am an archer,” Bhela replied tight-lipped. Well, it was obvious when she picked a bow the first thing she arrived here.</p>\n<p>“Ah, a beautiful and talented Archer then! It’s a pity, though for such a fine beautiful flower like yourself to be thrown into a heap of cow dung…”</p>\n<p>The remark made Bhela Malikh raise her brows. She somehow could predict where the topic was going to be directed.</p>\n<p>“That stupid engagement is what I say! How could a diamond such as yourself be forced to marry a trash from Yashura Family?”</p>\n<p>He sighed like he pitied the harsh fate of the beauty. And though unlikeable as he was, the murmurs of the crowd seemingly agreed with him. At that point, someone said, “That’s true. Even my ten years old nephew is one Level above him. Such trash to become…”</p>\n<p>The words stopped, Bhela looked at the person who said that. “The one from Yashura Family--he’s still a Level 3 Novice?”</p>\n<p>It was someone else who replied to her question. “Ah, yes, he’s stuck and made no progress even since Young Lady Bhela went outside the village. Everyone calls him The Eternal Novice.”</p>\n<p>And this made her raised brows turned into a frown. Going by the crowd, for a Level 5 Novice by fifteen years old was already considered slow progress even by the standard of rural places like Badril Village. Mostly at that age the youngsters already reached Level 7, the diligent ones could reach Level 8 with hard work. Faster than that, not counting usage of an unreasonable amount of growth-hack potions--which most children from rich noble families did, could be considered a talent amongst the younger generation. However, to think of a boy one year before his own coming-of-age ceremony coming still stuck at such low-level talent, even though if he was the heir of Badril Village’s major families, people would still call him trash, even in public.</p>\n<p>“Ah, Young Lady Bhela! You don’t have to bother yourself with such eyesore trash. I know you’re troubled with the careless arrangement your father made, but if we put our mind to it, we can--”</p>\n<p>All was well until the young man put bad words about her father. Never did he expect that the girl would mercilessly retract her hand just before the tips of their fingers touched.</p>\n<p>“Please don’t pretend you were familiar with me,” that was what she said.</p>\n<p>The rain of snickers rang all around him. Despite him glaring left and right in an intimidating manner, there was no way for him to suppress the crowd from humiliating him further. At the time he realized the chance for him to court the Young Lady of Malikh Family, the sole daughter of the Malikh Family Patriarch, was pitifully close to nothing. Thus, in a moment of spontaneity, he thought of a scheme to save his face and sounded it with a flash of desperate smirk plastered on his face. He grabbed a bow and said, “I see Young Lady Bhela rather reserved toward us long friends after two years abroad. Hmm, yeah, this is a perfect chance, by the way. I’m an Archer too, see. So why not this senior teach you a thing or two? Seventy meters--perhaps a good learning experience for young lady, no?”</p>\n<p>The surrounding began chattering lively. It was obvious it was a challenge as Archers. And the young man’s smirk turned more and more confident at the girl’s unresponsiveness. No matter how much potential talent one had, time and experience playing a vital role in assessing one’s current performance whether she was Archer or Priest or Knight or other classes. Skills, abilities one acquired after reaching the first barrier and getting a new class title could only progress with constant tempering in battle and improved alongside one’s level. The young man was a Level 12 Archer. So theoretically, a Level 10 new Archer like Bhela Malikh would need a few more years before she could beat the opponent in a fair competition.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh was annoyed. She glared at the ones who were supposed to be guarding the field. But Bony and his lackeys were busy counting coins. For Bhela, the crowd were a bunch of stupid annoying busybodies who prevented her to train in peace. But for Bony and his lackeys the crowd was simply a bunch of gold mines.</p>\n<p>“Please watch closely how I do it, Young Lady Bhela. See my elbow? If you could do the same way I do it, I’m sure your archery skill would improve significantly.”</p>\n<p>No one really bothered with the ‘humble direction’ the young man spouted. Bhela didn’t spare him a glance. She looked straight to target seventy meters from where she was standing. Repressing his anger, the young man began to shoot three arrows one by one splendidly; the final one landed right in the center of the target that was marked in red dot.</p>\n<p>He was satisfied with the result. Glancing at the young lady, this young man wanted to utter more words to improve his image. However, right before he opened his mouth, he found Bhela already drew her arrow, released it, and it hit one arrow splendidly. Not just hitting the target, but an arrow the young man previously shot. The second was the same. And the final third arrow also hit the arrow on the red dot.</p>\n<p>What was that? She used a skill? The young man wanted to object but his tongue froze and his lips quivered. Did she use <b>Far Sight</b> skill that enhanced eye-sight a hundred of meters away? Did she use <b>Boost Accuracy</b>, the skill that was supposedly forbidden to be used in duel between Archers? To think of beating him, an Archer older than her and 2 Level right above her, in such a devastating manner… she must be cheating, right?</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” the defeated young man said weakly, “I didn’t use my mana between my shots.”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh nodded.</p>\n<p>“Neither was I.”</p>\n<p>With that, Bhela turned around and left the crowd of dumbfounded boys with steps full of grace. She approached the entrance, returned back the bow she used to the three delinquents who just let people mess with her training and said coldly, “If this is how the famous Young Master Elzhier manages his property, then there’s no need for me to come here again. Please excuse me.”</p>\n<p>Bony’s expression didn’t change much as he still crossed his arms and rested his back casually on the wall.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Pilek, the one received the returned bow from Bhela, waved his hand again and shouted, “Take care, princess!”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Because she couldn’t train her archery peacefully in public, Bhela returned back to Malikh Family and trained in her private training place.</p>\n<p>It was originally a backyard turned archery ground, made by Malikh Family Patriarch after knowing his daughter showed interest in archery. It was nothing fancy. It was spacious and good enough when she started with her first bow but now Bhela felt the place was lacking. At most, she had to live with the meager fifty meters range maximum. Therefore, the practice she had made a habit of had to wait.</p>\n<p>Therefore, Bhela Malikh decided to put her mind over something else than her usual practice instead.</p>\n<p>She drew a deep breath. A table was provided with dozens of arrows laid on top of it. Bhela picked four at the same time, nocked them on her bow string. She began to aim.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the air surrounding her changed. Her inexperience as a newly Novice-graduate showed by the obvious mana that leaked from the inside out. With naked eyes, her mana looked calm colorful haze that consisted of four bold colors, tangling and struggling with each other for dominance. Her eyelashes quivered. Channeling mana to cast a skill she yet had mastered felt like trying to stand on the raging sea waves while she herself was being a weak newborn.</p>\n<p><em>Whhhhuuuuushh--</em></p>\n<p><em>Shuuuhsh--</em></p>\n<p><em>Ssshhhuuuush--</em></p>\n<p><em>Wwhuuuussh!!</em></p>\n<p>The fastest arrow, coated with sparking yellow-colored mana, hit one of the targets at around forty meters range. But the others performed pitifully. The one infused with wet blue-colored mana didn’t even reach two-third of the desired range. The green-colored one, an arrow infused with mana that generated unstable wind trajectory flew far far away, as if it was getting swallowed by the sky, never to be seen again. The last one, the red-colored arrow, was horrifying. It hit the training ground fence instead the target. The bamboo fences suddenly set ablaze by raging flames as soon as the said arrow came into contact with them.</p>\n<p><em>Clap clap clap!</em></p>\n<p>Uninvited claps resounded across the training ground. On the wall Good-Natured Spirit clapping after watching a good spectacle. For getting hand claps from a Nalaq like him, naturally the level of talent Bhela showed just now was far beyond ordinary.</p>\n<p>“Thank you…” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>It appeared she knew beforehand the four-arrows skill she shot would make a mess. So she gathered the maidservants and made them extinguish the fences that started to burn into ashes. “Thank you, thank you for your hard work,” she said to a pair of maidservants who briskly went back and forth to kill the fire before its spread.</p>\n<p>“Ah! Young lady, what skill was that just now?” one of the maidservants gawked after the fire was extinguished.</p>\n<p>“That wasn’t just your ordinary Archer skill, was it?” added the other.</p>\n<p>Summoning a blazing fire just with an arrow and pure mana was unheard of. At least, the maidservants knew nobody in the village could do that.</p>\n<p>Bhela drank a glass of murky liquify herbs mixed with mint to cool down her manasphere. “It’s something I learned when I was away,” she said after putting down the glass on the tray her maid servants provided. She continued, “I still can’t master it, though.”</p>\n<p>She cast her eyes at the unharmed targets one by one. Shooting at forty meters range was still too much for her using four arrows at the same time. When the maidservants realized her difficulty, they encouraged her to simplify it and shoot one arrow at a time. However at their suggestion, Bhela shook her head. “It’s the requirement of this skill I’ve got to shoot four arrows,” she explained.</p>\n<p>The maidservants nodded at her words and apologized for their shallow suggestion.</p>\n<p>“Don’t mind that,” Bhela waved her hand. “There’s something I heard from people, by the way. Something about Young Master Yashura.”</p>\n<p>The two maidservants glanced at each other before one of them replied. “The rumor says… he holed up from the public’s view because he’s ashamed he can’t even become a Level 4 Novice.”</p>\n<p>“Are the Yashura Family elders still favoring him as the heir of Yashura Family Patriarch?”</p>\n<p>“We don’t know whether they still favor him or not. But Yashura Family always united in their standing. So unless the current Patriarch of Yashura Family has a son, the Young Master Shira Yashura will undoubtedly become the next patriarch.”</p>\n<p>“No rumors about the Yashura Family elders wavering then?”</p>\n<p>The maidservants shook their heads altogether.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela… apologize for giving you my shallow suggestion once again but…” one of the maidservants came near to Bhela and whispered, “With him as the heir, Yashura Family’s future will be bleak. Everyone in our family said your father’s bad condition is a bad omen for us mingling with those simple Yashuras. I’m very sorry if this sounds impudent--but you should’ve better cut ties with them before too late, young lady. Madam was too grieved by your father’s ill health to make decisions thus the only one who can save our Malikh Family is you.”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at the maidservant. The glint on her eyes changed.</p>\n<p>“There’s already a plan laid to help our Malikh Family,” that was all Bhela said. “You better not say something like that again. You lucky no one here beside me to hear you utter that kind of words.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you for your mercy, young lady! We are sorry for being impudent!”</p>\n<p>They decided to make it history with only the four of them who knew the previous conversation. The four of them; the young lady and two maid servants and one Nalaq spirit who came here uninvited.</p>\n<p>“It seems I just heard something I shouldn’t hear,” Good-Natured Spirit said while he rubbed his chin. He came here peeking. He didn’t have the intention to reveal himself while the girls below had a secret conversation ignorant of his presence.</p>\n<p>After that Bhela continued with light training. Good-Natured Spirit watched her doing simple shooting, she didn’t even use a slightest of her mana from then on. Yawning, Good-Natured Spirit stood up. Then he flew away from Malikh Family and began to look for some other interesting thing to sate his boredom.</p>\n<hr>\n<authors-note id=\"Radhy\">\n<p>Testing, testing.

Biting her bottom lip, she whispered, “Please, head maid… if I perished due to bad luck, how could my family pay their debts?”</p>\n<p>“Get up now. Didn’t you say you have a way to pay it without working here for a dozen years more?”</p>\n<p>“That was before,” Jane’s voice was hoarse, “I never would’ve thought that bastard only spout empty promises of taking care of my family and other bullshit.

You’re hardworking girl albeit annoying, how come I want you to die?”</p>\n<p>Jane already feeling numb being called names by this woman ten years her senior.

She immediately came to head maid as soon as she knew her old post being taken and didn’t have time to gossip with other maidservants. “Really, head maid, you know I just came back. Don’t talk in a roundabout way…”</p>\n<p>“Sir Arden is going to hire an expert to clear plague in our Young Lady’s mansion, he’s planning to do it in a month's time,” the head maid said. “You know Sir Arden’s reputation, and you know how reliable his words are. Go serve Young Lady there--by the time Sir Arden comes with the hired expert, he’ll be grateful for loyal servants who willing to accompany his niece in her difficult time!”</p>\n<p>Hearing the urge behind head maid’s tone, Jane choked by her own cry from earlier. Even Madam Blackwood had to be polite to this younger brother of hers--as the man’s reputation was the sole reason Madam could be so tyrannical on ruling the house. But even then Sir Arden was too lazy to pay attention to his sister and her be. Jane, a mere maidservant--could she really gain Sir Arden Blackwood’s favor?</p>\n<p>The head maid continued, “What are you hesitating for? Even Floria that girl who even prettier than you couldn’t even get Sir Arden to glance at her--do you think any girl can have the same chance as yours right now?” she paused, learning the contour of Jane’s expression before she said again, “even if you can’t be his mistress, Jane, I assure you that even Butler Tim won’t be able to touch your position if Sir Arden Blackwood has a good impression on you.”</p>\n<p>Jane lowered her head. Head maid was right. A chance to get on Sir Arden Blackwood’s good side wouldn’t come as easily as this.</p>\n<p>She calculated the weight and found that, since two of her friends were sent to serve Young Lady Blackwood six month ago and still survive, a good odd that Sir Arden Blackwood would rescue her before the disease from Young Lady’s cursed bad luck would take her life for good.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>There was no need for her to prepare anything.

This steward talked as if he was sincerely giving advice, yet for those in the main manor who didn’t know the rumors about their young lady?

A moment later, Jane was stupefied when she found out that the two white doll-like girls with black eyebags on them were actually Emeralda and Jenny she had known back since her first year being a maidservant.

If you’ve got any questions, ask them directly to the old nanny who’s taking care of the young lady. Other maidservants are occupied. It’s best for you not to disturb them when they are busy.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” Jane replied, said nothing else.

There were one other maidservant and one old nanny beside them, whom, when Jane tried to greet them, didn’t even bat an eye and continued to be busy sweeping a clean place instead.</p>\n<p>“Listen, you,” the quiet steward approached Jane after he done unloading supplies and about to return back to the city, “I will come back one week after this to replenish the kitchen. If you’ve got any questions, ask them directly to the old nanny who’s taking care of the young lady. Other maidservants are occupied. It’s best for you not to disturb them when they are busy.”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” Jane replied, said nothing else. There was nothing she could say anyway, especially when she saw the usually lazy friends of hers became strangers and suspiciously diligent instead--they were so diligent that they spent the afternoon circling the yard looking for hidden dry leaves to sweep.</p>\n","volume-5/chapter-2-5":"<p>Dinner at Malikh Family; the family hall bustling with relatives who wanted to celebrate Bhela Malikh’s return. Even though the expensive Ngajen Ceremony drew near a good number of ducks and a goat were butchered along with their spice reserves taken out. There were laughters, there lots of people wanted to get on the good side of the only Young Lady of Malikh Family.</p>\n<p>But Bhela’s face was straight the whole time. Given choices, she’d rather have a small dinner with her mother and sick father right now.</p>\n<p>“I heard you went to Elzhier’s training facility as soon as you arrived, young lady,” a bald elder said with big smile. “That is no good. You just return home after four days of traveling. You must have a good rest first.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you for your concern, Elder Jhamil.”</p>\n<p>Bhela had experience with people during her two years abroad to know the meaning of smiles like Elder Jhamil’s--the kind of smile that didn’t reach eyes, the fake kind of smile. She always found it was uncomfortable whenever she met with one. Yet what was more uncomfortable was the fact she was the star of the party. Flatteries and congratulations flowing in. Bhela kept nodding her head and had a smiling expression on her face. No one really had a good time beside the ignorant families who came to find abundant foods to eat.</p>\n<p>Finally toward the end of the big dinner Elder Jhamil gave a few speeches and led everyone for their patriarch's health. Bhela hadn’t come home for two years, but she was alert enough to know the popular opinion going around inside the Malikh Family. She knew her father was disliked by many because the engagement he set up more than a dozen years ago, back when she wasn’t even able to speak yet, back when the Malikhs didn’t think much of it and didn’t know the girl back then would grow splendidly into a fair Young Lady. What she didn’t expect was that, Elder Jhamil, would point it out in front of other family members.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady, I’m sure you’re aware about it by now, but the one from Yashura Family is still stuck on the same level from back when you were leaving for your seminars.”</p>\n<p>“I’m aware, yes,” she said. “And?”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil smiled dryly at the question, he said, “With a partner that lazy he’d drag you sooner or later, wouldn’t he? Especially with special talent as yours, many would have second thoughts. But then how about you? Are you fine with that, Young Lady?”</p>\n<p>Bhela didn’t immediately say what was on her mind. She quietly picked the warm ginger drink they served her, drank it, while her eyes glanced at a certain direction where two maidservants who immediately glanced down the moment her eyes came into contact with theirs.</p>\n<p>Seeing that Bhela wasn’t that responsive with the idea, Elder Jhamil spoke further, “Young Lady, don’t worry, we as Malikhs only worried about your future. If you feel injustice in your heart, you must be brave, you must voice it out to your parents, Young Lady Bhela--all of us Malikhs support you for whichever path you choose! Isn’t that right, everyone?”</p>\n<p>“That’s right!” someone shouted. Then came more rougher voice--</p>\n<p>“We don’t fear those Yashura’s retaliation, Young Lady. You don’t have to be afraid they’ll come here to bully us because of that trash from Yashura Family!”</p>\n<p>“We support you, Young Lady!”</p>\n<p>“Don’t be afraid!”</p>\n<p>The dry smile on Elder Jhamil turned elated when people were chanting along with his cue. It was only when Bhela slowly put down the warm glass of ginger drink in her hand did they stop making ruckus, everyone was waiting for what Bhela was going to say next.</p>\n<p>“I think,” Bhela said with the remarkable cold expression of hers, “any engagement in the main family should be the main family’s business only.”</p>\n<p>She stopped. Not a single more soul dared to send her further flatteries until dinner was over. Even the bald Elder Jhamil, the most enthusiastic of all them, quietly sat back where he belonged.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>“Ah, young lady, please wait, Young Lady Bhela!” the bald Elder Jhamil chased her, trotting, with a box in his hands.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh frowned upon hearing the voice. But she hid her expression well as turned around and asked, “Is something the matter, Elder Jhamil?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, in fact, there’s one matter a bit inappropriate to deal in the family hall,” as soon as Elder Jhamil said that, he opened the box he carried. It was a dress. “It’s something that I get from a merchant who has a lot of dealing with people in the west. He told me this is apparently the current popular fashion for western nobles. I think it’s good for Young Lady.”</p>\n<p>Bhela studied Elder Jhamil’s expression. If the dress truly was a fashionable goods then the elder ought to have paid a quite of coins to get this. As far as Bhela Malikh remembered, Elder Jhamil she knew wasn’t this kind even when her father the patriarch married. Naturally with such an expensive homecoming gift, Bhela was alerted.</p>\n<p>“Thank you for your kindness, Elder Jhamil. Bhela will treasure this well.”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, you don’t have to mention it, Young Lady Bhela,” Elder Jhamil said with a laugh. Then, while rubbing his palms unconsciously, the bald elder began to smile--not a fake one like he usually did have, a genuine smile, one that reflected his current emotion--the smile of greed. “By the way, young lady,” he continued, “I heard you getting along well with the Young Master from the noble Blackwood Family during your time away…”</p>\n<p>“Young Lady of Blackwood Family is my friend,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“Yeah but… I also heard in the next ngajen ceremony, Young Master Blackwood would grace us with his presence… is that true?”</p>\n<p>“I wouldn’t know.”</p>\n<p>“Hehe,” Elder Jhamil chuckled knowingly. “I think things would go well if you wear that dress during ngajen ceremony, young lady.”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh said a short and ambiguous reply and tried to get away from the bald elder. After she escaped in the lone corridor, she took out the dress from the box. The said dress was glimmering under the torchlight, yet, in spite of that, Bhela wasn’t happy the slightest bit.</p>\n<p>“This kind of thing…”</p>\n<p>A proper dress for ladies of southern people was hiding everything below the collarbone. Showing more, akin to invite men to do something indecent. Bhela wasn’t a conservative to follow Mossack customes down rigidly as shown from her cutting her hair short despite the gesture usually reserved for unavailable widows. But still, something like decency of girlhood, was something even someone duller than Bhela should have. Even daring courtesans would think twice to wear this kind of provocative dress to attend a festivity made by the Mossack majority.</p>\n<p>It was distasteful. Bhela didn’t want to think too much about it. After putting back the dress, Bhela walked again to the east wing of Malikh Family where her father was resting.</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim Malikh’s sick room once used as the family’s <b>Alchemist</b> workplace. It had long been vacant, thus usually used to care sick and injured people, as it had the most complete medicinal facility in the entire Malikh Family. Upon entering the room, Bhela found the thick pungent of herbs made her head light. And still she was amazed by how loyal her mother was to taking care of her father closely when servants would need to take a breather of fresh air ten minutes inside the sick room.</p>\n<p>“Father, mother, I’m back…. Did they send some food here?”</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh, the mother, was the one who replied to Bhela. “They did. Some people might forget about the patriarch’s little family but there are still good aunties working in the kitchen,” a middle-aged woman said with a hint of sadness, helplessness, and resentment.</p>\n<p>“Does mother want some hot tea? I’ll go fetch and say my thanks for those good aunties,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“You girl, sit down. You just returned today, now you want to run around doing errands?” Madam Malikh smiled weakly. “How’s the village, dear? Does it change from the way you remembered?”</p>\n<p>“Somes changed, others stay the same, mother,” Bhela said. She got to the table and put the box Elder Jhamil gifted, then took it off her mind. She then picked a random book from the shelves. “Can I stay here for a while?” she asked while showing the book to her mother, telling her the intention that she was going to read it there.</p>\n<p>The mother’s smile turned strained. At noon, she purposely told this daughter of hers to see around the village because she was afraid, if Bhela spent too much time in this room, she would feel uncomfortable by the thick medicinal smell and grow to hate the idea of staying. Even some maidservants a few years older than her were fidgeting and eyeing for the door every time they had duty to bring a meal here. Yet, looking from her daughter’s unflinching eyes, Madam Malikh was relented in the end.</p>\n<p>“Sit here,” the mother offered her chair for her daughter, while she sat down on the edge of her husband’s bed.</p>\n<p>Bhela’s moved with small, noiseless steps, trying not to wake up her father. But it was unfortunate that her father woke up nonetheless.</p>\n<p>“Le… letter…”</p>\n<p>The quivering voice escaped his cracking dry lips.</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh wanted to retort. Not the letter again. No matter how many times she read it aloud he still thirst for the letter as if it was the only salvation left for his life. Nonetheless, she surrendered and she picked a smooth, white paper made from wood--the kind which was expensive and usually used overseas--and began to read its content.</p>\n<p>“I understand your situation. But sending help from where I am takes a while. Ask Yulong’s help for now.”</p>\n<p>As if the letter was his assurance, Patriarch Ghalim Malikh closed his eyes again.</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at her mother who folded the recently opened letter, she asked. “Whose letter is that?”</p>\n<p>“Your great-grandmother who lived overseas,” her mother said.</p>\n<p>“I see.” Bhela wasn’t sure which relative her mother mentioned, but she decided to ask something else seeing her mother’s bad mood. “Why Great-grandmother mentioned something about Yulong? Isn’t Yulong the Yashura Family’s butler, mother?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know, I reckon she told us to rely on Yashura Family instead.”</p>\n<p>The strained smile on her mother’s face made Bhela realize that even her mother was reluctant when Yashura Family was mentioned. As a mother, she loved Bhela dearly, and was the one to believe in her daughter before everyone else. She believed in her daughter’s future. That was why she was first to oppose Bhela’s engagement when the sour rumors about the heir of the Yashura Family started. Never would she expect that her Malikh Family would be in dire straits so suddenly they needed Yashura Family’s help to get them out of this mess.</p>\n<p>“Have you sent someone to inform Yulong, mother?” Bhela asked.</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh shook her head. Bhela reckoned with Elder Jhamil gaining influence so fast, her mother wouldn’t know anyone to trust in this kind of situation.</p>\n<p>The girl then gave her mother a glass of water to ease her down. “I’ll let him know then,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Dear,” Madam Malikh brushed her daughter’s hair as she smiled helplessly, “showing your face in Yashura Family might complicate things…”</p>\n<p>Bhela patted her mother’s hands and assured her, “Don’t worry, mother,” she said, “I’ll ask favors from people I know from Elzhier Family.”</p>\n<p>Bhela thought her parents would go along with her arrangement. Madam Malikh hung open her lips as if she wanted to say something, but then she tightened her smile in the end. Unexpectedly, it was a weak voice that disagreed instead.</p>\n<p>“Bhela… don’t...” her father whispered weakly.</p>\n<p>“Dear?” mother leaned on toward his mouth.</p>\n<p>“What is it, father?” Bhela, too, leaned closer.</p>\n<p>“Don’t… ask… don’t… favor… purple...” the sickly patriarch’s voice turned hoarse and defragmented before he completed his sentences. Bhela and her mother quickly shushed him, they couldn’t afford to see the sick father forcing himself with this condition. Even after two minutes, he still struggled to tell his words to his daughter. Though eventually he fell to slumber by himself after his wife tried to put him to sleep with her eyes wet with tears.</p>\n<p>Beside her mother, Bhela picked a bamboo fan and used it to make a breeze for her father’s sleep to be more comfortable. Her expression was flat and straight the entire time, but inside, she was disturbed by the words her father failed to tell her.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>For as long as the Yashuras knew him, their Young Master Shira Yashura lived alone in his house. The only other person who should’ve been living here, his father, didn’t come home for months already. So ever since his uncle let him live in his house a few years back, Shira enjoyed an independent lifestyle he’d take for granted one of these days.</p>\n<p>At night, his schedule often filled with working on painting commissions Good-Natured Spirit gave him. Which, unfortunately, not something he wished for people to know. This part of his schedule was one of his secrets, if known by a certain meddlesome cousin, hell would surely be waiting for him.</p>\n<p>“I told you again and again,” a voice from behind him blurted, “you should’ve shown the boobs a little more.”</p>\n<p>Shira turned his head and groaned when he found the Nalaq’s annoying face a little bit too close. “Can you knock the door first?”</p>\n<p>“No way. I came through the wall. Door? What is door? Never use the thing since ages ago.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t creep up from behind, then. At least preserve your dignity as a Nalaq.”</p>\n<p>“I told you, don’t call me Nalaq,” Good-Natured Spirit hissed. “Anyway, boobs! The bweebs!! Make it more sexy! More bold and open!”</p>\n<p>“That’s not what we agreed on,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“Just a little, man. A little dot--tiny nipply dot--that’s all I’m asking for.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t push it, old man.”</p>\n<p>“Ah! You’re not fun anymore,” Good-Natured Spirit moaned in disatisfaction. In addition of Nalaq, Good-Natured Spirit was never fond of being called old. He died in his early thirty. So he retained the look, and he--according to himself--was still as handsome as ever. “Ah, forget it,” he waved his hand lazily. “Your drawings are second-rate porns anyway.”</p>\n<p>“You’re not paying for this one again?” Shira asked.</p>\n<p>“Not this one. Too safe. Don’t want it. At least make her boobs and butt bigger for the next time.”</p>\n<p>Shira sighed and wrapped it up for tonight. Everytime Good-Natured Spirit cancelled the commission's Shira wouldn’t have any choice but selling the paintings half-baked to a peddler he knew. Not even a half price, he’d be lucky if the rejected paintings would sell even one-fifth from Good-Natured Spirit’s usual payment.</p>\n<p>While Shira was tidying up his room, Good-Natured Spirit looked at the lady in the painting. The Nalaq said, “Hmm. I gotta say, man, despite your second-rate skill you’re natural when it comes to drawing faces. Especially the eyes. How should I say this… those aren’t the eyes of cheap bitches usually have, I tell you.”</p>\n<p>Shira didn’t know whether he should feel flattered or not. After he tidied the room and hid the naughty painting carefully, he prepared to go to sleep.</p>\n<p>“Oh, by the way,” Good-Natured Spirit said as Shira changed his shirt, “I’ve checked on your girl, brat. She’s a real good beauty, alright. Her talent too is not to be scoffed at. And also--boobs.”</p>\n<p>Shira glanced at him with tightened brows. “I’ll be troubled if they somehow trace it back to me in case the Young Lady of Malikh Family was assaulted.”</p>\n<p>“Hehe, relax man, I’ll never touch my buddy’s chick. We’re buddies, aren’t we?”</p>\n<p>Shira wanted to say no but he felt it’d be better for him not to comment on that. He then hurriedly kicked out the Nalaq so he could get some sleep in peace.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In almost all of Mossack race traditions, ngajen ceremony held monthly in villages near a mountain. It was one of those legacy of ancient Mossack that still around simply because of its practice brought safety to the people. Originally was a session of prayers and offerings to calm down Selaqs which dwelling on the mountains--they had to, because many stories being passed down in every families that even ancient tribe chieftains and heroes couldn’t do nothing if waves of Selaqs rampaged over the southern lands. Though, as the cost of ceremony getting more expensive as the time went on and getting more political, nowadays it became a time of feasts for big families to assert their surrounding influence. And a time of feasts where small and independent families gained side incomes from providing food and good for the big families’ feats. Ngajen ceremony was also the main reason why there was a weird rule for every Mossack-rooted families, tribes, and clans, that saying the leaders must be someone of a great cook--the majority of them were simply foodies.</p>\n<p>“And thus, Shira my boy--” the patriarch said as he played with his thick moustache, “--us southern people are naturally different from those imperialist western Haldeens and those warmongers feudalists of eastern Kaya. We don’t simply become leaders because of our noble bloodlines or merits and achievements in battle but simply because of food. This is an important lesson, my boy: no matter one hails from a noble blood or being a simple commoner, no matter one’s an enemy or ally, in the end, everyone’s going to eat happily and peacefully when we southern cooks shove foods up in their mouths. Remember that.”</p>\n<p>Shira Yashura quietly nodded. He didn’t plan to learn cooking from the start but, as the heir of Yashura Family, spending effort on foods probably one of the most important lessons before he became the next Patriarch of Yashura Family.</p>\n<p>“So you understand. Good. Sooner or later you’ll understand being strong is not everything, having talent is not everything,” the patriarch said. “Look at your father, for instance. He’s the only one in Badril Village who has an Unique class since… I don’t know, many many years. He’s pretty badass, eh? But why is that the one who ended up being the patriarch was me?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, Uncle Shuro, please do tell me.”</p>\n<p>Shuro Yashura, the patriarch uncle, smiled as he looked at his obedient nephew. He then half-bragging said, “Because he can only boil water, that’s why. Cooking is a great heritage of our ancestors thus those who have no talent on it as to be satisfied with being a second-rate Mossack. The only reason why people like me always ended up becoming the leader of clans because we Mossack appreciate food to a very high degree. Justice is food. Food is justice. With great cooking comes great responsibility.”</p>\n<p>But from the side a sour voice butted in, “Ohh. You’ll never know how much bullshit my father made up just now.”</p>\n<p>Uncle and nephew turned their heads to see a daughter pop her head from the window. Apparently, Mila Yashura had just returned from doing morning errands.</p>\n<p>“What are you guys doing anyway?” she asked. Apparently, in the kitchen, she saw her father and cousin shredding a ridiculous amount of coconuts. No one else was here in the kitchen, so Mila asked, “Did you two really do these by all yourselves?”</p>\n<p>“Of course,” her father, the revered patriarch, said as his hand vigorously shredded coconut. He couldn’t hide the annoying proud smile on his mustache filled face.</p>\n<p>“Since dawn?” Mila asked again suspiciously.</p>\n<p>“Food is justice. Justice is food. With great cooking comes great responsibility. Shredding coconut is one of the fundamental lessons for Shira to become a great patriarch in the future.”</p>\n<p>“Well,” Mila commented, “that’s dumb.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, girl! What do you know? You know nothing about the important philosophy behind every essence of coconuts,” Shuro Yashura exploded. “Since you a girl who don’t have to lead the family then probably you’ll never understand. You’ll never have to understand the hidden substance of every food you’ve eaten! Almost every Mossack delicacies made with coconuts. That Bulayak Satay sauce you like so much is made with coconut milk as a base! And don’t forget goat stew! And baked shredded coconuts cookies! And rendang! You name it. Coconuts have been granted us with delicious foods ever since ancestors were hunters-gatherers! Our very roots of being the descendants of ancient Mossack race can be traced as long as one ponder the mystery behind every shred of coconuts! Look at ancient empires! The ancient Aratararadararam Empire, for an instance, five thousands years ago, formed their empire solely by cultivating lots of coconut trees! They’re building civilizations relying only on the blessing of coconuts! That’s how great coconuts are! Only us who were born to lead our very empire can understand how miraculous are to be feeling joyous in pondering the great essence of shredded coconuts. You don’t know this much then you’re a dumb girl, eh. What a waste of a daughter you are!!” After taking a deep breath, Patriarch Shuro snorted at his impudent daughter, then glanced at Shira, smiling. “Isn’t that right, Shira my boy?”</p>\n<p>That was dumb. Even Shira knew that much. Because of that he kept his head hung low and focused on his task of shredding coconuts, pretending not to hear the question coming at him.</p>\n<p>“See?” the patriarch smirked. “He’s too absorbed by the grace of shredding coconuts he doesn’t notice my words.”</p>\n<p>Mila rolled her eyes, began to ignore her father. “Anyway, Shira! Have you heard the story about that girl Malikh beating up the best Archer kid single-handedly?”</p>\n<p>Shira of course knew about the archery duel that happened yesterday. Because Yashura Family and Malikh Family were entangled in a planned marriage, almost everyone in Yashura Family--including servants and clueless children--were talking about it. Yet he couldn’t raise his head and answer. Do that, and his uncle Shuro would know he only pretended to be interested in shredding coconuts. He’d only hurt his uncle’s feelings that way. Thus, in spite of Mila being overly loud today, all Shira needed to do was shredding and shredding and sometimes stopped to feel the shredded coconuts with his fingers, releasing a solemn sigh, as if he found something profound in every fiber of shredded coconuts.</p>\n<p>“That’s my boy, you understand all too well after all,” Shuro Yashura nodded in satisfaction. He was relieved his successor could be that enlightened by the grace of shredded coconuts. He then glared at his own blood daughter, who supposed to be the princess of the family, nagging so loudly that she stood in borderline of being a tomboy girl and a fussy aunty.</p>\n<p>“Oh, man, just leave him alone, would ya? Just think how many years for him to catch up with his girl--the more you hold him back the more people talk shit about him, father!”</p>\n<p>“Please dear! Is that how you talk with your father? I’m not holding him back, okay?” Patriarch Shuro Yashura then asked Shira, “do I hold you back, Shira my boy?”</p>\n<p>Shira further lowered his head and pretended not to hear that as if he was a turtle.</p>\n<p>“Better be careful. He’s too deep in coconuts he doesn’t even hear me,” the patriarch gave his daughter a glare.</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura rolled her eyes. She crouched and disappeared from the window view, then stood up again a moment later. Her hand clutching a pebble.</p>\n<p>The patriarch gawked, “Oi, what are you--”</p>\n<p>Mila aimed the pebble at Shira and it hit his head with an audible knock.</p>\n<p>“Thousands of gods!” Shira swore.</p>\n<p>“Too deep my ass,” Mila sneered. Unlike her father, she knew too well whenever Shira playing dumb.</p>\n<p>“What do you want?” Shira asked as he rubbed his head.</p>\n<p>“Let’s train your sword skill. You don’t want to face your fiancée with that crappy skill of yours, do you?”</p>\n<p>Shira glanced at his uncle unwillingly. “Do I have to meet with Bhela in her Family?”</p>\n<p>“That’s right, Shira my boy. You rarely visit other houses during ngajen ceremony but old folks from the Elder Council think this is a good time to show Malikh Family our good will,” Shuro Yashura said. “Remember to pray for their patriarch’s health too. He’s your father best friend, after all.”</p>\n<p>As if waiting for Patriarch Shuro’s completed his words, the door of the kitchen knocked at the very moment. A tall gray-haired old man entered. He had a posture that was straight and sharp, classy western-style butler uniform that hadn’t had looked worn out in spite no tailors around to know how to sew the said uniform, and his hand was balanced to hold a tray with a dozen elixirs on top of it with his left hand fingers, while his right hand rested on his back as if he followed an etiquette stranger to most of the villagers. He was the sole butler in Yashura Family--and perhaps, the only butler that ever employed in Badril VIllage.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira, this month’s elixirs your father sent for you have arrived,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Thank you, Yulong.”</p>\n<p>As usual, Shira drank elixirs his father sent abroad without a rest. The content was painfully bitter, thank goodness Yulong provided brown sugars for the boy to nibble after he drank those. His father Jhuro Yashura said--in a letter from abroad--that the elixirs were some kind of nutrient custom-made only for Shira, were expensive, so they could only afford them every one or two months.</p>\n<p>“How do you feel, Shira my boy?”</p>\n<p>Shira said as he munched a brown sugar to dismiss the bitter after taste. “Uh-hm. Better?”</p>\n<p>The family always thought they were a level-boost potion, Jhuro once sent a potion that could increase Shira’s level up to Level 3 in a single gulp after all. But the elixirs seemed to do nothing other than let Shira sleep comfortably at night. Still, his relatives, especially Mila, put their hopes on the resourceful Jhuro Yashura to nurture his own son--the heir of Yashura Family.</p>\n<p>Seeing the lack of enthusiasm in his nephew’s eyes, Patriarch Shuro laughed and said, “Haha. If those don’t work on your progress problems, don’t let it bother you! Your father worked very hard as an instructor in second-rank school and he’d definitely send a better elixir, like that one from three years ago!”</p>\n<p>“Oh,” Shira nodded. The elixir from three years ago was special. He knew it the moment he drank the potion. The warm feeling surrounding his manasphere was special, as with only drinking from one bottle, he leveled up 2 levels overnight.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>After that his uncle let him go out of the kitchen, since it was promised that Shira would do errands for his aunt every morning.</p>\n<p>When he was heading off for his duty, Shira Yashura got pranked by Good-Natured Spirit in the hallway, popped out his head from a wall and cried, “Boo!”--which Shira ignored because Yulong the butler was walking behind him.</p>\n<p>Yulong said with a polite baritone voice of his, “Young Master Shira, do you perhaps would visit the peddler today?”</p>\n<p>Shira looked at the butler. The matter about him doing business with a peddler wasn’t known to the family; but since Yulong wasn’t a Yashura and had been taking care of him since little, he eventually knew about the few investment deals that Shira never talked about. After collecting his thoughts, the boy replied to Yulong’s question, “Depends on the errand I receive, really. My aunt still hasn’t given my errands this morning,” the boy said.</p>\n<p>“I see, Patriarch Shuro took your time since early morning, so if madam doesn’t take pity for you then young master would finish today’s morning errands a little too late.”</p>\n<p>“The market would be too crowded if that happened,” Shira lamented. It couldn’t be helped. Boys and girls around ages of nine and sixteen--before they received coming-of-age ceremony--had to finish several trivial tasks each morning from both parents. It was a custom mainly to educate filial piety, though some smart parents and big family policies would give errands for the young’uns to make them do things that were beneficial for their futures, like street smarts and forming their own social circles outside the playmates they met everyday. Because his mother wasn’t here since he was a baby, and his father never came home for months, it was his aunt who always gave him errands.</p>\n<p>“Young Master,” Yulong stopped him again, “I’m glad for Young Master taking initiatives to improve your life. You grow too fast for this old butler to look after you. But as a child stepping into the adult world, please let me give you a small advice.”</p>\n<p>“I’m all ears, Yulong.”</p>\n<p>Yulong said, “You cannot guarantee everyone’s nature all around you, Young Master. Especially those who come approaching you with impure motives. I hope Young Master understands this, and to not make friends with nasty people.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit, who was around, snorted.</p>\n<p>Shira pretended he didn’t hear the Nalaq and nodded at the butler’s words. “You don’t have to worry about the peddler. Even though he’s been peddling for two years now, I found the fella got a pretty good sense.”</p>\n<p>“Hearing your words relieves me greatly. Thank you.”</p>\n<p>Afterward, Yulong excused himself as he needed to check the servants’ works for the arrangement of Ngajen Ceremony. The butler unassumingly walked on the side of the corridor, avoiding Good-Natured Spirit who was floating in the way, as if he knew there was something unpleasant floating in the way.</p>\n<p>“So long, fucker,” Good-Natured Spirit flashed his middle finger to Yulong’s back who just passed him by. Of course, the old butler didn’t show any reaction to his insult.</p>\n<p>“Why did you always do that to him?” Shira said to him with a frown.</p>\n<p>“This middle finger?” Good-Natured Spirit asked back.</p>\n<p>“No, the insult.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit grinned.</p>\n<p>“You know nothing about this middle finger, eh? Hehehh heh....”</p>\n<p>Yulong was someone Shira heartily respected. He always used polite language when talking to the butler. Because of that he was irked by the way Good-Natured Spirit sneered.</p>\n<p>“I need to sell the painting you rejected before the market becomes too crowdy. Let’s go,” he said. Bantering with Good-Natured Spirit would only make him more cocky, so Shira held the urge to humor his annoying behavior and headed off to the village’s market.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Back in the kitchen, Mila stayed with his father--who still shredding coconuts--while she read from a see-through board in front of her.</p>\n<p>“Ugh… his experience didn’t even change a single point,” Mila groaned.</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro too engrossed himself in coconut to realize what his daughter was doing just now. “You did a <b>Status Window</b> on him?”</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura nodded. Her face was sour though. “Look at this, old man. See what’s wrong with the number?”</p>\n<p>“Hah, his <b>Dodge Rating</b> getting crazier than before,” Shuro Yashura said with his fingers rubbing his moustache.</p>\n<p>“No! Look, father--his combat attributes, look closely! <b>Strength</b>, <b>Agility</b>, <b>Dexterity</b>! All of them pitifully underdeveloped. And look at the <b>Wisdom</b> attribute now!”</p>\n<p>“Ooh, his Wisdom’s pretty high. I knew his head’s pretty good. No wonder he could ponder the real meaning of shredded coconuts… he’s really a wise kid, after all.”</p>\n<p>“Please be serious, father. This is a serious matter.”</p>\n<p>“I’m serious,” Shuro the patriarch frowned. “And shredded coconut is a serious matter too!”</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura took a deep breath. Getting emotional over her father’s stupidity would only complicate the conversation.</p>\n<p>“Did you really hear the nickname they gave you...?” Mila asked him as she massaged her forehead. “It’s toothless Yashura. Toothless!”</p>\n<p>“Who said that?”</p>\n<p>“People.”</p>\n<p>“Fuck them people,” Shuro said. He never heard those old fogies calling him “toothless”, so he reckoned young'uns were the ones who came up with that. He sighed. For them to call this patriarch who always held the title of the best cook in Badril Village, those young people really didn’t have a good sense in them.</p>\n<p>“Because there’s Uncle Jhuro’s watching us from behind as a patriarch you can be toothless incompetent all you want, father, but--”</p>\n<p>“Oi, mind your words!”</p>\n<p>“--But!” Mila asserted despite her father started to pout after being called an incompetent, “but my generation is going to be harsh. No one as skilled and as strong as Uncle Jhuro appeared in the young’uns to be the guardian lion as our emblem is supposed to be.”</p>\n<p>“That is maybe but what are you trying to say here?”</p>\n<p>“What I’m saying is Shira can’t afford to be another toothless patriarch. You’re a support class, father, a <b>Specialist</b> like me. In our Badril Village history no matter how great your cooking is and no matter how wide our connections are if a conflict to arise a support class as a patriarch, nobody’d take us seriously--that is, unless another Unique Class who can afford to stay here in the village appears to scare them annoying people.”</p>\n<p>“Hoo, it seems you’ve been using your head a lot recently. That’s quite surprising.”</p>\n<p>Mila pursed her lips.</p>\n<p>“Unlike a certain carefree toothless patriarch, me and most family members concerned about Shira’s progress stuck as a Level 3 Novice. And what’s more, that girl Bhela Malikh--I don’t like what she did with her hair.”</p>\n<p>“Her hair?”</p>\n<p>“She cut her hair short. I confirmed it myself.”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro shook his head. He knew what his daughter was worrying about. “Girl, nephew Bhela has been away from the village and our dull way of thinking. She had been living with people in different cultures and customs these past two years. Maybe she cut her hair because she wants to follow fashion. Like that Aunty Yarly’s girl who suddenly has her lips red with lip balms, see? The young'uns are always doing it whenever foreigners come bringing their latest fads with them. You’re thinking too much.”</p>\n<p>“Why does everyone think Bhela Malikh is just some brainless girl who doesn’t know what she’s doing?” Mila Yashura frowned. “She’s smart, father. Even Shira knows she’s smart. You know what Shira said when I told him her fiancée has short hair now?--”</p>\n<p>She smirked.</p>\n<p>“--He said, ‘the engagement’s not going to work’.”</p>\n<p>“Bah! He’s been saying that shit for years!”</p>\n<p>“I know, I know!” Mila said. “But this time he’s serious. He said that with a punchable face as if he was saying ‘see, I told you’. His face looked punchable, I tell ya!”</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura was genuinely angry. This time, Patriarch Shuro Yashura didn’t immediately reply. He looked at his daughter, scratched his head, said, “So, in short, you worried about we can’t do nothing if Bhela is serious about cutting her hair to state her stance on her own engagement?”</p>\n<p>“Well, yeah! Of course I am. Only widows who cut hairs like that!”</p>\n<p>“You think it’s because she doesn’t like being paired with our Shira who is much weaker than her?”</p>\n<p>“Well, duh, old man, you’re still asking the obvious?”</p>\n<p>“Then don’t worry, look again at his status,” Shuro Yashura tossed back the status window back to his daughter. Its lifespan hasn't yet expired, so it was still showing Shira’s attributes and status as Level 3 Novice. “See what’s wrong in there?”</p>\n<p>Mila opened her mouth, “His combat attributes--”</p>\n<p>“No, look again!” Shuro cut off.</p>\n<p>Despite knitting her eyebrows, Mila still didn’t catch his father’s drift.</p>\n<p>Seeing his daughter had a hard time figuring it out, Shuro Yashura revealed, “His elemental affinity. See?”</p>\n<p>“It’s <b>Water</b> elemental affinity. It’s not that rare. What’s wrong with it?”</p>\n<p>“Well, he’s still a Novice. Getting a class still far away from him.”</p>\n<p>When a person reached the first barrier at Level 10 and got his class, there was a chance for him to aversed in one or more elementals and largely transformed, or perhaps even enhanced, the skills he would get from the class he acquired. Not everyone, but the chance was more than fifty-fifty. Aside from the rare ones, four base elementals that commonly appeared were <b>Fire</b>, <b>Wind</b>, <b>Lightning</b>, and <b>Water</b>--Mila wasn’t sure what so special for her cousin acquired an affinity over one of those base elementals.</p>\n<p>“Have you seen anyone with an elemental affinity in his Novice years?” her father asked.</p>\n<p>“It’s rare…” Mila was unsure, “can’t say I have.”</p>\n<p>“You haven’t. I have,” Shuro Yashura said. “Twenty seven years ago. Your Uncle Jhuro had a huge fight with grandfather and he ran away into the Mossy Forest behind the mountain--for nearly three weeks. He ate wild fruits. He ate monster meat also. But in the last three days he got unlucky and got poisoned by a snake monster ten levels above him. He struggled with death. Alone in that forest. But he lived. The fool then decided the forest was too dangerous for him and he returned back home.”--and got to experience a near-death situation again after their furious father almost pummeled him to pulp, Patriarch Shuro’s memories drifted.</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura listened. She knew the story of how his uncle survived alone in Mossy Forest--it was crazy, a kind of legend for the young’uns today. That was the first story amongst stories about the Badril Village’s last Unique Class warrior--Jhuro Yashura the Blackfang Swordsman--the story that first made him famous in the village for his unordinary bravery and recklessness.</p>\n<p>Shuro Yashura asked her daughter, “You know what happened after that, right?”</p>\n<p>She nodded.</p>\n<p>“Uncle awakened his rare <b>Poison</b> elemental affinity.”</p>\n<p>And Jhuro Yashura wasn’t even reached Level 10 back then.</p>\n<p>There was an unspoken law of the system most people didn’t know. A premonition, or sign, more appropriately, that if a Novice got an elemental before acquiring a class, chance was, an Unique class would be waiting for him.</p>\n<p>“See what I’m getting at?” Shuro Yashura said with a smile. “Time will reveal it, you don’t have to worry. Sooner or later, there’ll be another Unique class in our Yashura Family.”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>That morning the family getting busy preparing for ngajen ceremony; family officials, the servants, even brats too, were busy with their own errands. Usually with a few of copper kobe coins older kids could secretly pass their morning errands to the little ones--as lazier and richer kids like Shira wasn’t foreign to the practice, but unfortunately he couldn’t find some kids to bribe even on days like this. Not that he wasn’t happy about it. The errand his aunt gave him accidentally had something to do in the market, the destination he’d go to sell his painting today anyway.</p>\n<p>“Is it me or someone’s been staring at me since I stepped out of my family’s gate?”</p>\n<p>“It’s not you,” Good-Natured Spirit replied to Shira's question. “It seems the stalker Big-Boobed Sect sent today was particularly sloopy, kinda annoying.”</p>\n<p>“Oh yeah? How many of them are following me?” Shira asked half-heartedly.</p>\n<p>“What? You don’t believe them Big-Boobed Sect always spying on us?”</p>\n<p>Shira shrugged. Good-Natured Spirit was right--the boy didn’t believe his ramblings about all-girl sect always hiding in Badril Village’s shadows, especially with those padded words about them being beautiful and having bountiful bodies. He didn’t believe it because he still got some common sense. Not to mention hidden sects, even some decent clans and schools wouldn’t bother with ordinary places like Badril Village.</p>\n<p>And thus as he had feared, the market was already crowded by then. The moment Shira realized it, Good-Natured Spirit already drifted away by the sight of excitement in gambling dens and beautiful young wives from Elzhier Family sold street foods. As it turned out, it was stamped on the Nalaq’s mind to get off Shira as soon as they came to the market lest the boy’d use him for errands one way or another. The peddler Shira acquainted with was getting a good crowd as he laid his wares behind his wagon.</p>\n<p>“Monkey!”</p>\n<p>The peddler behind the wares turned his head. He had a funny face, a rare trait that made him resemble a monkey. And there was no coincidence everyone called him Monkey. When Monkey slightly wandered his eyes through the crowd and saw Shira, he waved his hands to the grunting customers and told them he’d close his shop for a while.</p>\n<p>“Well, well, isn’t this our Young Master Shira blessing us with his presence?” the smiling Monkey briskly approached as he rubbed his palms excitedly. “Can I help you young master?”</p>\n<p>Shira stepped back when Monkey got too close. “Monkey, you better stop being creepy whenever I come visit you.”</p>\n<p>“You hurt me, young master. There’s nothing creepy about our business relationship.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, it’s your face. Don’t make me regret selling my painting to you.”</p>\n<p>“Haha, surely you jest, Young Master Shira--I’m trying my best to maintain a professional face from now on!” Monkey said that then immediately took a small peek at the content. “Your skill is just getting better and better, master. I’m sure this will sell well, Master!”</p>\n<p>“What’s with the master thing?”</p>\n<p>“How dare for me to call you ‘Young Master’ while you yourself are already an expert at this stage?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t want our relationship getting creepier than it already is,” Shira said, then he took out a pouch of coins. “Anyways, I got an errand from my aunt, so give me the thirteen dried spices worth all this money.”</p>\n<p>“What kind of spice?”</p>\n<p>“All kinds of spices.”</p>\n<p>“Of course, of course, I’ll give you a discount, just to celebrate your improvement in the path of drawing, Master.”</p>\n<p>By the time Shira got himself a basketful of spices, Monkey’s grin getting more annoying. The stereotypical fat and slimy merchants looked innocent compared to him. After Shira threw a frowning glance at him, he <em>reluctantly</em> admitted, “Young master may not know this, but recently I’ve got an Alchemist partner with me who was trying to be independent from his family,” he said. “And I must tell you, young master, this family is a many-hundreds of years Alchemists family, and you also must know he’s not kicked out of incompetente--”</p>\n<p>Shira cut his roundabout pitching. “You want me to back the Alchemist?”</p>\n<p>“Mmm...yes….” Monkey nodded with a wry smile.</p>\n<p>The boy’s eyes wandered through the peddler’s wares before looked at him in the eyes. “Even I must tread through the game of cat and dog with the elders because of the rules,” he explained to Monkey, who in turn, could only smile helplessly.</p>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>Mossack’s custom dictates children who haven’t gone through their coming of age ceremony--usually at the age of sixteen--to not being involved in politics and commerce. This is the reason why Shira--as he mostly acquired money winning through streaks of chess games with Good-Natured Spirit--couldn’t recklessly flaunt his personal wealth in public.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>The risk of having a relationship gone sour with this young master, Monkey knew that. It was unlikely for an upstart peddler to be relied on by a future patriarch of a big family, and he wholeheartedly believed it was unwise to create a trivial misunderstanding with Young Master Shira Yashura. After all, it was only one year until Shira would have his own coming of age ceremony. Therefore, Monkey didn’t want to impose on the Young Master’s kindness too much and quickly changed the topic with something he’d prepared beforehand.</p>\n<p>“This is a <b>Boost Elixir</b> concocted by my partner. He might not a 2nd-Tier Alchemist yet but I assure you, Young Master Shira, the elixir’s potent power won’t lose against any experts you’ll find anywhere!” Monkey said with his over-excited sales pitch, which made him look more funny than usual, “This humble bottle was scientifically proven to increase a person’s level as long as he is below the age of twenty! To date, this Boost Elixir has 100% effectiveness in increasing the user’s level! Young master, you are very lucky--you can have this miraculous elixir just for half of the original price today!”</p>\n<p>Though it was clear Monkey meant no harm, Shira narrowed his eyes at the pedder.</p>\n<p>“Did someone pay you to make me drink it?” he asked suspiciously.</p>\n<p>“You jest again, Young Master… ha ha… haaa….” Monkey awkwardly laughed as he tried to hide his dampened enthusiasm. “Why don’t you try it first, Young Master Shira. You don’t have to pay if you didn’t get to graduate from Level 3 Novice.”</p>\n<p>Eventually, Shira drank the Boost Elixir within a gulp, not because he believed its miraculous effect, but because he was weak for free and discounted goods.</p>\n<p>“Your EXP bar didn’t even budge a little,” Monkey muttered with a meek voice.</p>\n<p>“The liquid is surprisingly well made though. Is this really made by someone you know?”</p>\n<p>“I said before, Young Master. The one who made this hailed from an old Alchemist family that even outside South Tiramikal Kingdom their last name still can be a pretty big deal. I’m pretty confident that--normally--this elixir will have a 100% success rate for leveling up whoever drinks it!”</p>\n<p>“Such a confident boast. Are you perhaps implying that my case is not <em>normally</em>?”</p>\n<p>“He hehe, you surely joke. You know that I don’t mean any harm, young master.”</p>\n<p>Shira of course knew it. And the other thing he also knew, that if it was a really impressive elixir he just drank by now, the usual Monkey wouldn’t utter a single phrase of the word “free”, regardless how many times the elixir failed to deliver its promise.</p>\n<p>Shira looked at Monkey suspiciously, “You’re Monkey, aren’t you? Not someone brainwashed by my family’s enemy or something like that? You know, by vampires.”</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira… now your joke is not even funny--something like a poor peddler to be brainwashed only appears in stories. Vampires are some unfounded folklore.”</p>\n<p>“Monkey I know is stupid. If not brainwashed, then he definitely manipulated to sell a fake elixir to someone from big families.”</p>\n<p>Before Monkey was able to retort that, a cold voice came from the wagon. “Young Master Yashura, I don’t mind if you pinpoint Monkey’s stupidity and make assumptions about him muchever you want. But to call my elixir is fake, I can’t stand and watch around anymore.”</p>\n<p>A man appeared from the wagon Monkey had, had an appearance of the stereotypical scholar Shira had in mind--though, by the way he crossed his arms pompously, he seemed to have a pride worthy of someone hailed from big families.</p>\n<p>“You’re the Alchemist?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, you call me Snake--don’t ask for my real name,” the Alchemist said.</p>\n<p>One would hide his name if he didn’t want to be associated with his family anymore. So Shira didn’t ask. He looked at the scholarly Alchemist, then at the peddler. One was the Snake and the other one was the Monkey.</p>\n<p>Shira found some sort of strange camradice between them. “I see, so both of you decided to be a partner for life.”</p>\n<p>“Not for life, no. Spare me. It’s better for me to ditch this stupid ape as soon as he outlives his usefulness.”</p>\n<p>“Heey! Don’t say ditching in front of me!” Monkey protested. Snake ignored him without pretense, making the impression that this scene was ordinary for them.</p>\n<p>Shira then asked Snake straightforwardly.</p>\n<p>“What kind of elixir is this?”</p>\n<p>“Didn’t Monkey tell you? A Boost Elixir. My latest masterpiece,” Snake replied.</p>\n<p>“You’re aware that your partner tried to sell your masterpiece at a half price, right? I don’t even have to pay, it was what he said before.”</p>\n<p>“It was my idea,” Snake said. “This is a simple business hack. I’m confident about my concoctions. After all, I experimented heavily on human anatomy--too heavy, even, to the point folks in my family want me gone for good. I’ve got nothing to lose here. That bottle is a prototype; it cost a lot so I planned to price it a lot.”</p>\n<p>“You want to use my bad reputation as a stepping stone, don’t you?” Shira asked with a sour smile.</p>\n<p>“Yes. Do you mind?”</p>\n<p>“No, I’d gladly make profit out of those trash talking they did behind my back--though, it seems you picked the wrong guinea pig to be your mascot for your ‘business hack’,” Shira said with a wry smile.</p>\n<p>Monkey nodded weakly. As a peddler from outside the village, he was always bothered by how nasty rumors could be, especially with some acquaintance he depended on sometimes as an important business partner.</p>\n<p>Seeing that they no longer had things to chat about, Shira said to them he’d consider putting some resources if he managed to gain some nod from the family elders after he went through the coming-of-age ceremony next year. And now that he finished selling Good-Natured Spirit’s rejected commision and completed the errand his aunt gave him, Shira then bid farewell to the two animal-nicknamed gentlemen.</p>\n<p>“Please wait, Young Master Shira.”</p>\n<p>Shira turned back his head again and found Snake, the one who called him, ran back to Monkey’s wagon to grab something.</p>\n<p>“Try to drink this one,” Snake said after trotting back hurriedly. “It’s alright, you don’t have to pay for this time too.”</p>\n<p>The current elixir Snake took out was the exact opposite from the previous one. Its container was beautiful and high-class, but the content was muddy and very low in quality. Hearing that this one was also free, Shira didn’t hesitate to drink it.</p>\n<p>The after taste was incredibly sour. Unlike any other bitter concocted elixirs or potions he ever drank. Although not much, Shira could feel his body warming up. He was surprised at the unexpected reaction.</p>\n<p>“Oohhhh!!!” Monkey cried as his eyes glued at Shira’s Status Window. “The EXP bar moved!”</p>\n<p>“What?” the surprised Shira glanced at Snake and asked slowly, “This one’s free, right?”</p>\n<p>It was in a single flash Shira did catch a strange dumbfoundedness in Snake eyes, like the result even came more shocking than him than either of Shira and Monkey. Yet the moment after he promptly regained his stoic exposure, then said to Shira, “Don’t worry, I don’t plan to take back my words,”</p>\n<p>The odd Alchemist put his hands at his back and walked back to his wagon. Before he climbed the wagon, he once again glanced at Shira, looking in a state of half-disbelief like expression</p>\n<p>As Snake disappeared into the wagon, Shira and Monkey exchanged glances.</p>\n<p>“He still has that kind of face even though he promises it to be free? You sure do have an odd friend.” Shira said.</p>\n<p>Monkey grinned. “Though an oddball, I never seen anyone with more talent in alchemy than him, like, ever.”</p>\n<p>After leaving Monkey to continue his stall, Shira saw Good-Natured Spirit again when he visited a food stall not far from Monkey’s wagon. He asked what he was doing, and the Nalaq told him there was a fool who bet a lot and won a lot in the gambling games. To lose against in gambling against someone with Good-Natured Spirit’s caliber, really--Shira sighed--he couldn’t wait for his coming-of-age ceremony next year so he too could farm on these gullible people in some friendly matches--just like what he did with Good-Natured Spirit for this past one year.</p>\n<p>“You know,” munching on some satays he bought from the market, Shira muttered when he headed home along with Good-Natured Spirit, “just then I drank this elixir that really could boost my EXP a little. I don’t know how the guy concocts it, but I have the feeling that I just drink some very expensive elixir for free.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, yeah?”</p>\n<p>On the way back to Yashura Family Shira told the Nalaq spirit about the Alchemist and his elixirs. He also told him that his status that usually wouldn’t react to normal elixirs this time moved a bit after he drank a strange low-quality elixir.</p>\n<p>“That Alchemist must be a nerd to be that sharp,” Good-Natured Spirit said as he floated lazily beside the boy.</p>\n<p>“He looks like that too. The peddler he partnered with also has some good sense in him. So I thought it’s not a loss for me to use all those foreign coins I got from you to invest on them for the next year.”</p>\n<p>“Hmm,” Good-Natured Spirit crossed his arms. “I think you should be worried.”</p>\n<p>“Worried? Why?”</p>\n<p>“You said that nerd Alchemist was the one who pushed that low-quality elixir to you, right?”</p>\n<p>“I got to drink that for free,” Shira emphasized.</p>\n<p>“He realized one little secret about you then,” Good-Natured Spirit said.</p>\n<p>Shira stopped walking. He looked at him with his head tilted.</p>\n<p>“What secret?”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit who floated before, spoke again.</p>\n<p>“You shouldn’t worry about it too much for now, brat. But, I advise you, if you are still holding dear for your lazy, peaceful village life, you should turn back and kill him right now.”</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-5/chapter-2":"<p>Dinner at Malikh Family; the family hall bustling with relatives who wanted to celebrate Bhela Malikh’s return. Even though the expensive Ngajen Ceremony drew near a good number of ducks and a goat were butchered along with their spice reserves taken out. There were laughters, there lots of people wanted to get on the good side of the only Young Lady of Malikh Family.</p>\n<p>But Bhela’s face was straight the whole time. Given choices, she’d rather have a small dinner with her mother and sick father right now.</p>\n<p>“I heard you went to Elzhier’s training facility as soon as you arrived, young lady,” a bald elder said with big smile. “That is no good. You just return home after four days of traveling. You must have a good rest first.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you for your concern, Elder Jhamil.”</p>\n<p>Bhela had experience with people during her two years abroad to know the meaning of smiles like Elder Jhamil’s--the kind of smile that didn’t reach eyes, the fake kind of smile. She always found it was uncomfortable whenever she met with one. Yet what was more uncomfortable was the fact she was the star of the party. Flatteries and congratulations flowing in. Bhela kept nodding her head and had a smiling expression on her face. No one really had a good time beside the ignorant families who came to find abundant foods to eat.</p>\n<p>Finally toward the end of the big dinner Elder Jhamil gave a few speeches and led everyone for their patriarch's health. Bhela hadn’t come home for two years, but she was alert enough to know the popular opinion going around inside the Malikh Family. She knew her father was disliked by many because the engagement he set up more than a dozen years ago, back when she wasn’t even able to speak yet, back when the Malikhs didn’t think much of it and didn’t know the girl back then would grow splendidly into a fair Young Lady. What she didn’t expect was that, Elder Jhamil, would point it out in front of other family members.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady, I’m sure you’re aware about it by now, but the one from Yashura Family is still stuck on the same level from back when you were leaving for your seminars.”</p>\n<p>“I’m aware, yes,” she said. “And?”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil smiled dryly at the question, he said, “With a partner that lazy he’d drag you sooner or later, wouldn’t he? Especially with special talent as yours, many would have second thoughts. But then how about you? Are you fine with that, Young Lady?”</p>\n<p>Bhela didn’t immediately say what was on her mind. She quietly picked the warm ginger drink they served her, drank it, while her eyes glanced at a certain direction where two maidservants who immediately glanced down the moment her eyes came into contact with theirs.</p>\n<p>Seeing that Bhela wasn’t that responsive with the idea, Elder Jhamil spoke further, “Young Lady, don’t worry, we as Malikhs only worried about your future. If you feel injustice in your heart, you must be brave, you must voice it out to your parents, Young Lady Bhela--all of us Malikhs support you for whichever path you choose! Isn’t that right, everyone?”</p>\n<p>“That’s right!” someone shouted. Then came more rougher voice--</p>\n<p>“We don’t fear those Yashura’s retaliation, Young Lady. You don’t have to be afraid they’ll come here to bully us because of that trash from Yashura Family!”</p>\n<p>“We support you, Young Lady!”</p>\n<p>“Don’t be afraid!”</p>\n<p>The dry smile on Elder Jhamil turned elated when people were chanting along with his cue. It was only when Bhela slowly put down the warm glass of ginger drink in her hand did they stop making ruckus, everyone was waiting for what Bhela was going to say next.</p>\n<p>“I think,” Bhela said with the remarkable cold expression of hers, “any engagement in the main family should be the main family’s business only.”</p>\n<p>She stopped. Not a single more soul dared to send her further flatteries until dinner was over. Even the bald Elder Jhamil, the most enthusiastic of all them, quietly sat back where he belonged.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>“Ah, young lady, please wait, Young Lady Bhela!” the bald Elder Jhamil chased her, trotting, with a box in his hands.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh frowned upon hearing the voice. But she hid her expression well as turned around and asked, “Is something the matter, Elder Jhamil?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, in fact, there’s one matter a bit inappropriate to deal in the family hall,” as soon as Elder Jhamil said that, he opened the box he carried. It was a dress. “It’s something that I get from a merchant who has a lot of dealing with people in the west. He told me this is apparently the current popular fashion for western nobles. I think it’s good for Young Lady.”</p>\n<p>Bhela studied Elder Jhamil’s expression. If the dress truly was a fashionable goods then the elder ought to have paid a quite of coins to get this. As far as Bhela Malikh remembered, Elder Jhamil she knew wasn’t this kind even when her father the patriarch married. Naturally with such an expensive homecoming gift, Bhela was alerted.</p>\n<p>“Thank you for your kindness, Elder Jhamil. Bhela will treasure this well.”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, you don’t have to mention it, Young Lady Bhela,” Elder Jhamil said with a laugh. Then, while rubbing his palms unconsciously, the bald elder began to smile--not a fake one like he usually did have, a genuine smile, one that reflected his current emotion--the smile of greed. “By the way, young lady,” he continued, “I heard you getting along well with the Young Master from the noble Blackwood Family during your time away…”</p>\n<p>“Young Lady of Blackwood Family is my friend,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“Yeah but… I also heard in the next ngajen ceremony, Young Master Blackwood would grace us with his presence… is that true?”</p>\n<p>“I wouldn’t know.”</p>\n<p>“Hehe,” Elder Jhamil chuckled knowingly. “I think things would go well if you wear that dress during ngajen ceremony, young lady.”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh said a short and ambiguous reply and tried to get away from the bald elder. After she escaped in the lone corridor, she took out the dress from the box. The said dress was glimmering under the torchlight, yet, in spite of that, Bhela wasn’t happy the slightest bit.</p>\n<p>“This kind of thing…”</p>\n<p>A proper dress for ladies of southern people was hiding everything below the collarbone. Showing more, akin to invite men to do something indecent. Bhela wasn’t a conservative to follow Mossack customes down rigidly as shown from her cutting her hair short despite the gesture usually reserved for unavailable widows. But still, something like decency of girlhood, was something even someone duller than Bhela should have. Even daring courtesans would think twice to wear this kind of provocative dress to attend a festivity made by the Mossack majority.</p>\n<p>It was distasteful. Bhela didn’t want to think too much about it. After putting back the dress, Bhela walked again to the east wing of Malikh Family where her father was resting.</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim Malikh’s sick room once used as the family’s <b>Alchemist</b> workplace. It had long been vacant, thus usually used to care sick and injured people, as it had the most complete medicinal facility in the entire Malikh Family. Upon entering the room, Bhela found the thick pungent of herbs made her head light. And still she was amazed by how loyal her mother was to taking care of her father closely when servants would need to take a breather of fresh air ten minutes inside the sick room.</p>\n<p>“Father, mother, I’m back…. Did they send some food here?”</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh, the mother, was the one who replied to Bhela. “They did. Some people might forget about the patriarch’s little family but there are still good aunties working in the kitchen,” a middle-aged woman said with a hint of sadness, helplessness, and resentment.</p>\n<p>“Does mother want some hot tea? I’ll go fetch and say my thanks for those good aunties,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“You girl, sit down. You just returned today, now you want to run around doing errands?” Madam Malikh smiled weakly. “How’s the village, dear? Does it change from the way you remembered?”</p>\n<p>“Somes changed, others stay the same, mother,” Bhela said. She got to the table and put the box Elder Jhamil gifted, then took it off her mind. She then picked a random book from the shelves. “Can I stay here for a while?” she asked while showing the book to her mother, telling her the intention that she was going to read it there.</p>\n<p>The mother’s smile turned strained. At noon, she purposely told this daughter of hers to see around the village because she was afraid, if Bhela spent too much time in this room, she would feel uncomfortable by the thick medicinal smell and grow to hate the idea of staying. Even some maidservants a few years older than her were fidgeting and eyeing for the door every time they had duty to bring a meal here. Yet, looking from her daughter’s unflinching eyes, Madam Malikh was relented in the end.</p>\n<p>“Sit here,” the mother offered her chair for her daughter, while she sat down on the edge of her husband’s bed.</p>\n<p>Bhela’s moved with small, noiseless steps, trying not to wake up her father. But it was unfortunate that her father woke up nonetheless.</p>\n<p>“Le… letter…”</p>\n<p>The quivering voice escaped his cracking dry lips.</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh wanted to retort. Not the letter again. No matter how many times she read it aloud he still thirst for the letter as if it was the only salvation left for his life. Nonetheless, she surrendered and she picked a smooth, white paper made from wood--the kind which was expensive and usually used overseas--and began to read its content.</p>\n<p>“I understand your situation. But sending help from where I am takes a while. Ask Yulong’s help for now.”</p>\n<p>As if the letter was his assurance, Patriarch Ghalim Malikh closed his eyes again.</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at her mother who folded the recently opened letter, she asked. “Whose letter is that?”</p>\n<p>“Your great-grandmother who lived overseas,” her mother said.</p>\n<p>“I see.” Bhela wasn’t sure which relative her mother mentioned, but she decided to ask something else seeing her mother’s bad mood. “Why Great-grandmother mentioned something about Yulong? Isn’t Yulong the Yashura Family’s butler, mother?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know, I reckon she told us to rely on Yashura Family instead.”</p>\n<p>The strained smile on her mother’s face made Bhela realize that even her mother was reluctant when Yashura Family was mentioned. As a mother, she loved Bhela dearly, and was the one to believe in her daughter before everyone else. She believed in her daughter’s future. That was why she was first to oppose Bhela’s engagement when the sour rumors about the heir of the Yashura Family started. Never would she expect that her Malikh Family would be in dire straits so suddenly they needed Yashura Family’s help to get them out of this mess.</p>\n<p>“Have you sent someone to inform Yulong, mother?” Bhela asked.</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh shook her head. Bhela reckoned with Elder Jhamil gaining influence so fast, her mother wouldn’t know anyone to trust in this kind of situation.</p>\n<p>The girl then gave her mother a glass of water to ease her down. “I’ll let him know then,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Dear,” Madam Malikh brushed her daughter’s hair as she smiled helplessly, “showing your face in Yashura Family might complicate things…”</p>\n<p>Bhela patted her mother’s hands and assured her, “Don’t worry, mother,” she said, “I’ll ask favors from people I know from Elzhier Family.”</p>\n<p>Bhela thought her parents would go along with her arrangement. Madam Malikh hung open her lips as if she wanted to say something, but then she tightened her smile in the end. Unexpectedly, it was a weak voice that disagreed instead.</p>\n<p>“Bhela… don’t...” her father whispered weakly.</p>\n<p>“Dear?” mother leaned on toward his mouth.</p>\n<p>“What is it, father?” Bhela, too, leaned closer.</p>\n<p>“Don’t… ask… don’t… favor… purple...” the sickly patriarch’s voice turned hoarse and defragmented before he completed his sentences. Bhela and her mother quickly shushed him, they couldn’t afford to see the sick father forcing himself with this condition. Even after two minutes, he still struggled to tell his words to his daughter. Though eventually he fell to slumber by himself after his wife tried to put him to sleep with her eyes wet with tears.</p>\n<p>Beside her mother, Bhela picked a bamboo fan and used it to make a breeze for her father’s sleep to be more comfortable. Her expression was flat and straight the entire time, but inside, she was disturbed by the words her father failed to tell her.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>For as long as the Yashuras knew him, their Young Master Shira Yashura lived alone in his house. The only other person who should’ve been living here, his father, didn’t come home for months already. So ever since his uncle let him live in his house a few years back, Shira enjoyed an independent lifestyle he’d take for granted one of these days.</p>\n<p>At night, his schedule often filled with working on painting commissions Good-Natured Spirit gave him. Which, unfortunately, not something he wished for people to know. This part of his schedule was one of his secrets, if known by a certain meddlesome cousin, hell would surely be waiting for him.</p>\n<p>“I told you again and again,” a voice from behind him blurted, “you should’ve shown the boobs a little more.”</p>\n<p>Shira turned his head and groaned when he found the Nalaq’s annoying face a little bit too close. “Can you knock the door first?”</p>\n<p>“No way. I came through the wall. Door? What is door? Never use the thing since ages ago.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t creep up from behind, then. At least preserve your dignity as a Nalaq.”</p>\n<p>“I told you, don’t call me Nalaq,” Good-Natured Spirit hissed. “Anyway, boobs! The bweebs!! Make it more sexy! More bold and open!”</p>\n<p>“That’s not what we agreed on,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“Just a little, man. A little dot--tiny nipply dot--that’s all I’m asking for.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t push it, old man.”</p>\n<p>“Ah! You’re not fun anymore,” Good-Natured Spirit moaned in disatisfaction. In addition of Nalaq, Good-Natured Spirit was never fond of being called old. He died in his early thirty. So he retained the look, and he--according to himself--was still as handsome as ever. “Ah, forget it,” he waved his hand lazily. “Your drawings are second-rate porns anyway.”</p>\n<p>“You’re not paying for this one again?” Shira asked.</p>\n<p>“Not this one. Too safe. Don’t want it. At least make her boobs and butt bigger for the next time.”</p>\n<p>Shira sighed and wrapped it up for tonight. Everytime Good-Natured Spirit cancelled the commission's Shira wouldn’t have any choice but selling the paintings half-baked to a peddler he knew. Not even a half price, he’d be lucky if the rejected paintings would sell even one-fifth from Good-Natured Spirit’s usual payment.</p>\n<p>While Shira was tidying up his room, Good-Natured Spirit looked at the lady in the painting. The Nalaq said, “Hmm. I gotta say, man, despite your second-rate skill you’re natural when it comes to drawing faces. Especially the eyes. How should I say this… those aren’t the eyes of cheap bitches usually have, I tell you.”</p>\n<p>Shira didn’t know whether he should feel flattered or not. After he tidied the room and hid the naughty painting carefully, he prepared to go to sleep.</p>\n<p>“Oh, by the way,” Good-Natured Spirit said as Shira changed his shirt, “I’ve checked on your girl, brat. She’s a real good beauty, alright. Her talent too is not to be scoffed at. And also--boobs.”</p>\n<p>Shira glanced at him with tightened brows. “I’ll be troubled if they somehow trace it back to me in case the Young Lady of Malikh Family was assaulted.”</p>\n<p>“Hehe, relax man, I’ll never touch my buddy’s chick. We’re buddies, aren’t we?”</p>\n<p>Shira wanted to say no but he felt it’d be better for him not to comment on that. He then hurriedly kicked out the Nalaq so he could get some sleep in peace.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In almost all of Mossack race traditions, ngajen ceremony held monthly in villages near a mountain. It was one of those legacy of ancient Mossack that still around simply because of its practice brought safety to the people. Originally was a session of prayers and offerings to calm down Selaqs which dwelling on the mountains--they had to, because many stories being passed down in every families that even ancient tribe chieftains and heroes couldn’t do nothing if waves of Selaqs rampaged over the southern lands. Though, as the cost of ceremony getting more expensive as the time went on and getting more political, nowadays it became a time of feasts for big families to assert their surrounding influence. And a time of feasts where small and independent families gained side incomes from providing food and good for the big families’ feats. Ngajen ceremony was also the main reason why there was a weird rule for every Mossack-rooted families, tribes, and clans, that saying the leaders must be someone of a great cook--the majority of them were simply foodies.</p>\n<p>“And thus, Shira my boy--” the patriarch said as he played with his thick moustache, “--us southern people are naturally different from those imperialist western Haldeens and those warmongers feudalists of eastern Kaya. We don’t simply become leaders because of our noble bloodlines or merits and achievements in battle but simply because of food. This is an important lesson, my boy: no matter one hails from a noble blood or being a simple commoner, no matter one’s an enemy or ally, in the end, everyone’s going to eat happily and peacefully when we southern cooks shove foods up in their mouths. Remember that.”</p>\n<p>Shira Yashura quietly nodded. He didn’t plan to learn cooking from the start but, as the heir of Yashura Family, spending effort on foods probably one of the most important lessons before he became the next Patriarch of Yashura Family.</p>\n<p>“So you understand. Good. Sooner or later you’ll understand being strong is not everything, having talent is not everything,” the patriarch said. “Look at your father, for instance. He’s the only one in Badril Village who has an Unique class since… I don’t know, many many years. He’s pretty badass, eh? But why is that the one who ended up being the patriarch was me?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, Uncle Shuro, please do tell me.”</p>\n<p>Shuro Yashura, the patriarch uncle, smiled as he looked at his obedient nephew. He then half-bragging said, “Because he can only boil water, that’s why. Cooking is a great heritage of our ancestors thus those who have no talent on it as to be satisfied with being a second-rate Mossack. The only reason why people like me always ended up becoming the leader of clans because we Mossack appreciate food to a very high degree. Justice is food. Food is justice. With great cooking comes great responsibility.”</p>\n<p>But from the side a sour voice butted in, “Ohh. You’ll never know how much bullshit my father made up just now.”</p>\n<p>Uncle and nephew turned their heads to see a daughter pop her head from the window. Apparently, Mila Yashura had just returned from doing morning errands.</p>\n<p>“What are you guys doing anyway?” she asked. Apparently, in the kitchen, she saw her father and cousin shredding a ridiculous amount of coconuts. No one else was here in the kitchen, so Mila asked, “Did you two really do these by all yourselves?”</p>\n<p>“Of course,” her father, the revered patriarch, said as his hand vigorously shredded coconut. He couldn’t hide the annoying proud smile on his mustache filled face.</p>\n<p>“Since dawn?” Mila asked again suspiciously.</p>\n<p>“Food is justice. Justice is food. With great cooking comes great responsibility. Shredding coconut is one of the fundamental lessons for Shira to become a great patriarch in the future.”</p>\n<p>“Well,” Mila commented, “that’s dumb.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, girl! What do you know? You know nothing about the important philosophy behind every essence of coconuts,” Shuro Yashura exploded. “Since you a girl who don’t have to lead the family then probably you’ll never understand. You’ll never have to understand the hidden substance of every food you’ve eaten! Almost every Mossack delicacies made with coconuts. That Bulayak Satay sauce you like so much is made with coconut milk as a base! And don’t forget goat stew! And baked shredded coconuts cookies! And rendang! You name it. Coconuts have been granted us with delicious foods ever since ancestors were hunters-gatherers! Our very roots of being the descendants of ancient Mossack race can be traced as long as one ponder the mystery behind every shred of coconuts! Look at ancient empires! The ancient Aratararadararam Empire, for an instance, five thousands years ago, formed their empire solely by cultivating lots of coconut trees! They’re building civilizations relying only on the blessing of coconuts! That’s how great coconuts are! Only us who were born to lead our very empire can understand how miraculous are to be feeling joyous in pondering the great essence of shredded coconuts. You don’t know this much then you’re a dumb girl, eh. What a waste of a daughter you are!!” After taking a deep breath, Patriarch Shuro snorted at his impudent daughter, then glanced at Shira, smiling. “Isn’t that right, Shira my boy?”</p>\n<p>That was dumb. Even Shira knew that much. Because of that he kept his head hung low and focused on his task of shredding coconuts, pretending not to hear the question coming at him.</p>\n<p>“See?” the patriarch smirked. “He’s too absorbed by the grace of shredding coconuts he doesn’t notice my words.”</p>\n<p>Mila rolled her eyes, began to ignore her father. “Anyway, Shira! Have you heard the story about that girl Malikh beating up the best Archer kid single-handedly?”</p>\n<p>Shira of course knew about the archery duel that happened yesterday. Because Yashura Family and Malikh Family were entangled in a planned marriage, almost everyone in Yashura Family--including servants and clueless children--were talking about it. Yet he couldn’t raise his head and answer. Do that, and his uncle Shuro would know he only pretended to be interested in shredding coconuts. He’d only hurt his uncle’s feelings that way. Thus, in spite of Mila being overly loud today, all Shira needed to do was shredding and shredding and sometimes stopped to feel the shredded coconuts with his fingers, releasing a solemn sigh, as if he found something profound in every fiber of shredded coconuts.</p>\n<p>“That’s my boy, you understand all too well after all,” Shuro Yashura nodded in satisfaction. He was relieved his successor could be that enlightened by the grace of shredded coconuts. He then glared at his own blood daughter, who supposed to be the princess of the family, nagging so loudly that she stood in borderline of being a tomboy girl and a fussy aunty.</p>\n<p>“Oh, man, just leave him alone, would ya? Just think how many years for him to catch up with his girl--the more you hold him back the more people talk shit about him, father!”</p>\n<p>“Please dear! Is that how you talk with your father? I’m not holding him back, okay?” Patriarch Shuro Yashura then asked Shira, “do I hold you back, Shira my boy?”</p>\n<p>Shira further lowered his head and pretended not to hear that as if he was a turtle.</p>\n<p>“Better be careful. He’s too deep in coconuts he doesn’t even hear me,” the patriarch gave his daughter a glare.</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura rolled her eyes. She crouched and disappeared from the window view, then stood up again a moment later. Her hand clutching a pebble.</p>\n<p>The patriarch gawked, “Oi, what are you--”</p>\n<p>Mila aimed the pebble at Shira and it hit his head with an audible knock.</p>\n<p>“Thousands of gods!” Shira swore.</p>\n<p>“Too deep my ass,” Mila sneered. Unlike her father, she knew too well whenever Shira playing dumb.</p>\n<p>“What do you want?” Shira asked as he rubbed his head.</p>\n<p>“Let’s train your sword skill. You don’t want to face your fiancée with that crappy skill of yours, do you?”</p>\n<p>Shira glanced at his uncle unwillingly. “Do I have to meet with Bhela in her Family?”</p>\n<p>“That’s right, Shira my boy. You rarely visit other houses during ngajen ceremony but old folks from the Elder Council think this is a good time to show Malikh Family our good will,” Shuro Yashura said. “Remember to pray for their patriarch’s health too. He’s your father best friend, after all.”</p>\n<p>As if waiting for Patriarch Shuro’s completed his words, the door of the kitchen knocked at the very moment. A tall gray-haired old man entered. He had a posture that was straight and sharp, classy western-style butler uniform that hadn’t had looked worn out in spite no tailors around to know how to sew the said uniform, and his hand was balanced to hold a tray with a dozen elixirs on top of it with his left hand fingers, while his right hand rested on his back as if he followed an etiquette stranger to most of the villagers. He was the sole butler in Yashura Family--and perhaps, the only butler that ever employed in Badril VIllage.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira, this month’s elixirs your father sent for you have arrived,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Thank you, Yulong.”</p>\n<p>As usual, Shira drank elixirs his father sent abroad without a rest. The content was painfully bitter, thank goodness Yulong provided brown sugars for the boy to nibble after he drank those. His father Jhuro Yashura said--in a letter from abroad--that the elixirs were some kind of nutrient custom-made only for Shira, were expensive, so they could only afford them every one or two months.</p>\n<p>“How do you feel, Shira my boy?”</p>\n<p>Shira said as he munched a brown sugar to dismiss the bitter after taste. “Uh-hm. Better?”</p>\n<p>The family always thought they were a level-boost potion, Jhuro once sent a potion that could increase Shira’s level up to Level 3 in a single gulp after all. But the elixirs seemed to do nothing other than let Shira sleep comfortably at night. Still, his relatives, especially Mila, put their hopes on the resourceful Jhuro Yashura to nurture his own son--the heir of Yashura Family.</p>\n<p>Seeing the lack of enthusiasm in his nephew’s eyes, Patriarch Shuro laughed and said, “Haha. If those don’t work on your progress problems, don’t let it bother you! Your father worked very hard as an instructor in second-rank school and he’d definitely send a better elixir, like that one from three years ago!”</p>\n<p>“Oh,” Shira nodded. The elixir from three years ago was special. He knew it the moment he drank the potion. The warm feeling surrounding his manasphere was special, as with only drinking from one bottle, he leveled up 2 levels overnight.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>After that his uncle let him go out of the kitchen, since it was promised that Shira would do errands for his aunt every morning.</p>\n<p>When he was heading off for his duty, Shira Yashura got pranked by Good-Natured Spirit in the hallway, popped out his head from a wall and cried, “Boo!”--which Shira ignored because Yulong the butler was walking behind him.</p>\n<p>Yulong said with a polite baritone voice of his, “Young Master Shira, do you perhaps would visit the peddler today?”</p>\n<p>Shira looked at the butler. The matter about him doing business with a peddler wasn’t known to the family; but since Yulong wasn’t a Yashura and had been taking care of him since little, he eventually knew about the few investment deals that Shira never talked about. After collecting his thoughts, the boy replied to Yulong’s question, “Depends on the errand I receive, really. My aunt still hasn’t given my errands this morning,” the boy said.</p>\n<p>“I see, Patriarch Shuro took your time since early morning, so if madam doesn’t take pity for you then young master would finish today’s morning errands a little too late.”</p>\n<p>“The market would be too crowded if that happened,” Shira lamented. It couldn’t be helped. Boys and girls around ages of nine and sixteen--before they received coming-of-age ceremony--had to finish several trivial tasks each morning from both parents. It was a custom mainly to educate filial piety, though some smart parents and big family policies would give errands for the young’uns to make them do things that were beneficial for their futures, like street smarts and forming their own social circles outside the playmates they met everyday. Because his mother wasn’t here since he was a baby, and his father never came home for months, it was his aunt who always gave him errands.</p>\n<p>“Young Master,” Yulong stopped him again, “I’m glad for Young Master taking initiatives to improve your life. You grow too fast for this old butler to look after you. But as a child stepping into the adult world, please let me give you a small advice.”</p>\n<p>“I’m all ears, Yulong.”</p>\n<p>Yulong said, “You cannot guarantee everyone’s nature all around you, Young Master. Especially those who come approaching you with impure motives. I hope Young Master understands this, and to not make friends with nasty people.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit, who was around, snorted.</p>\n<p>Shira pretended he didn’t hear the Nalaq and nodded at the butler’s words. “You don’t have to worry about the peddler. Even though he’s been peddling for two years now, I found the fella got a pretty good sense.”</p>\n<p>“Hearing your words relieves me greatly. Thank you.”</p>\n<p>Afterward, Yulong excused himself as he needed to check the servants’ works for the arrangement of Ngajen Ceremony. The butler unassumingly walked on the side of the corridor, avoiding Good-Natured Spirit who was floating in the way, as if he knew there was something unpleasant floating in the way.</p>\n<p>“So long, fucker,” Good-Natured Spirit flashed his middle finger to Yulong’s back who just passed him by. Of course, the old butler didn’t show any reaction to his insult.</p>\n<p>“Why did you always do that to him?” Shira said to him with a frown.</p>\n<p>“This middle finger?” Good-Natured Spirit asked back.</p>\n<p>“No, the insult.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit grinned.</p>\n<p>“You know nothing about this middle finger, eh? Hehehh heh....”</p>\n<p>Yulong was someone Shira heartily respected. He always used polite language when talking to the butler. Because of that he was irked by the way Good-Natured Spirit sneered.</p>\n<p>“I need to sell the painting you rejected before the market becomes too crowdy. Let’s go,” he said. Bantering with Good-Natured Spirit would only make him more cocky, so Shira held the urge to humor his annoying behavior and headed off to the village’s market.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Back in the kitchen, Mila stayed with his father--who still shredding coconuts--while she read from a see-through board in front of her.</p>\n<p>“Ugh… his experience didn’t even change a single point,” Mila groaned.</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro too engrossed himself in coconut to realize what his daughter was doing just now. “You did a <b>Status Window</b> on him?”</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura nodded. Her face was sour though. “Look at this, old man. See what’s wrong with the number?”</p>\n<p>“Hah, his <b>Dodge Rating</b> getting crazier than before,” Shuro Yashura said with his fingers rubbing his moustache.</p>\n<p>“No! Look, father--his combat attributes, look closely! <b>Strength</b>, <b>Agility</b>, <b>Dexterity</b>! All of them pitifully underdeveloped. And look at the <b>Wisdom</b> attribute now!”</p>\n<p>“Ooh, his Wisdom’s pretty high. I knew his head’s pretty good. No wonder he could ponder the real meaning of shredded coconuts… he’s really a wise kid, after all.”</p>\n<p>“Please be serious, father. This is a serious matter.”</p>\n<p>“I’m serious,” Shuro the patriarch frowned. “And shredded coconut is a serious matter too!”</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura took a deep breath. Getting emotional over her father’s stupidity would only complicate the conversation.</p>\n<p>“Did you really hear the nickname they gave you...?” Mila asked him as she massaged her forehead. “It’s toothless Yashura. Toothless!”</p>\n<p>“Who said that?”</p>\n<p>“People.”</p>\n<p>“Fuck them people,” Shuro said. He never heard those old fogies calling him “toothless”, so he reckoned young'uns were the ones who came up with that. He sighed. For them to call this patriarch who always held the title of the best cook in Badril Village, those young people really didn’t have a good sense in them.</p>\n<p>“Because there’s Uncle Jhuro’s watching us from behind as a patriarch you can be toothless incompetent all you want, father, but--”</p>\n<p>“Oi, mind your words!”</p>\n<p>“--But!” Mila asserted despite her father started to pout after being called an incompetent, “but my generation is going to be harsh. No one as skilled and as strong as Uncle Jhuro appeared in the young’uns to be the guardian lion as our emblem is supposed to be.”</p>\n<p>“That is maybe but what are you trying to say here?”</p>\n<p>“What I’m saying is Shira can’t afford to be another toothless patriarch. You’re a support class, father, a <b>Specialist</b> like me. In our Badril Village history no matter how great your cooking is and no matter how wide our connections are if a conflict to arise a support class as a patriarch, nobody’d take us seriously--that is, unless another Unique Class who can afford to stay here in the village appears to scare them annoying people.”</p>\n<p>“Hoo, it seems you’ve been using your head a lot recently. That’s quite surprising.”</p>\n<p>Mila pursed her lips.</p>\n<p>“Unlike a certain carefree toothless patriarch, me and most family members concerned about Shira’s progress stuck as a Level 3 Novice. And what’s more, that girl Bhela Malikh--I don’t like what she did with her hair.”</p>\n<p>“Her hair?”</p>\n<p>“She cut her hair short. I confirmed it myself.”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro shook his head. He knew what his daughter was worrying about. “Girl, nephew Bhela has been away from the village and our dull way of thinking. She had been living with people in different cultures and customs these past two years. Maybe she cut her hair because she wants to follow fashion. Like that Aunty Yarly’s girl who suddenly has her lips red with lip balms, see? The young'uns are always doing it whenever foreigners come bringing their latest fads with them. You’re thinking too much.”</p>\n<p>“Why does everyone think Bhela Malikh is just some brainless girl who doesn’t know what she’s doing?” Mila Yashura frowned. “She’s smart, father. Even Shira knows she’s smart. You know what Shira said when I told him her fiancée has short hair now?--”</p>\n<p>She smirked.</p>\n<p>“--He said, ‘the engagement’s not going to work’.”</p>\n<p>“Bah! He’s been saying that shit for years!”</p>\n<p>“I know, I know!” Mila said. “But this time he’s serious. He said that with a punchable face as if he was saying ‘see, I told you’. His face looked punchable, I tell ya!”</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura was genuinely angry. This time, Patriarch Shuro Yashura didn’t immediately reply. He looked at his daughter, scratched his head, said, “So, in short, you worried about we can’t do nothing if Bhela is serious about cutting her hair to state her stance on her own engagement?”</p>\n<p>“Well, yeah! Of course I am. Only widows who cut hairs like that!”</p>\n<p>“You think it’s because she doesn’t like being paired with our Shira who is much weaker than her?”</p>\n<p>“Well, duh, old man, you’re still asking the obvious?”</p>\n<p>“Then don’t worry, look again at his status,” Shuro Yashura tossed back the status window back to his daughter. Its lifespan hasn't yet expired, so it was still showing Shira’s attributes and status as Level 3 Novice. “See what’s wrong in there?”</p>\n<p>Mila opened her mouth, “His combat attributes--”</p>\n<p>“No, look again!” Shuro cut off.</p>\n<p>Despite knitting her eyebrows, Mila still didn’t catch his father’s drift.</p>\n<p>Seeing his daughter had a hard time figuring it out, Shuro Yashura revealed, “His elemental affinity. See?”</p>\n<p>“It’s <b>Water</b> elemental affinity. It’s not that rare. What’s wrong with it?”</p>\n<p>“Well, he’s still a Novice. Getting a class still far away from him.”</p>\n<p>When a person reached the first barrier at Level 10 and got his class, there was a chance for him to aversed in one or more elementals and largely transformed, or perhaps even enhanced, the skills he would get from the class he acquired. Not everyone, but the chance was more than fifty-fifty. Aside from the rare ones, four base elementals that commonly appeared were <b>Fire</b>, <b>Wind</b>, <b>Lightning</b>, and <b>Water</b>--Mila wasn’t sure what so special for her cousin acquired an affinity over one of those base elementals.</p>\n<p>“Have you seen anyone with an elemental affinity in his Novice years?” her father asked.</p>\n<p>“It’s rare…” Mila was unsure, “can’t say I have.”</p>\n<p>“You haven’t. I have,” Shuro Yashura said. “Twenty seven years ago. Your Uncle Jhuro had a huge fight with grandfather and he ran away into the Mossy Forest behind the mountain--for nearly three weeks. He ate wild fruits. He ate monster meat also. But in the last three days he got unlucky and got poisoned by a snake monster ten levels above him. He struggled with death. Alone in that forest. But he lived. The fool then decided the forest was too dangerous for him and he returned back home.”--and got to experience a near-death situation again after their furious father almost pummeled him to pulp, Patriarch Shuro’s memories drifted.</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura listened. She knew the story of how his uncle survived alone in Mossy Forest--it was crazy, a kind of legend for the young’uns today. That was the first story amongst stories about the Badril Village’s last Unique Class warrior--Jhuro Yashura the Blackfang Swordsman--the story that first made him famous in the village for his unordinary bravery and recklessness.</p>\n<p>Shuro Yashura asked her daughter, “You know what happened after that, right?”</p>\n<p>She nodded.</p>\n<p>“Uncle awakened his rare <b>Poison</b> elemental affinity.”</p>\n<p>And Jhuro Yashura wasn’t even reached Level 10 back then.</p>\n<p>There was an unspoken law of the system most people didn’t know. A premonition, or sign, more appropriately, that if a Novice got an elemental before acquiring a class, chance was, an Unique class would be waiting for him.</p>\n<p>“See what I’m getting at?” Shuro Yashura said with a smile. “Time will reveal it, you don’t have to worry. Sooner or later, there’ll be another Unique class in our Yashura Family.”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>That morning the family getting busy preparing for ngajen ceremony; family officials, the servants, even brats too, were busy with their own errands. Usually with a few of copper kobe coins older kids could secretly pass their morning errands to the little ones--as lazier and richer kids like Shira wasn’t foreign to the practice, but unfortunately he couldn’t find some kids to bribe even on days like this. Not that he wasn’t happy about it. The errand his aunt gave him accidentally had something to do in the market, the destination he’d go to sell his painting today anyway.</p>\n<p>“Is it me or someone’s been staring at me since I stepped out of my family’s gate?”</p>\n<p>“It’s not you,” Good-Natured Spirit replied to Shira's question. “It seems the stalker Big-Boobed Sect sent today was particularly sloopy, kinda annoying.”</p>\n<p>“Oh yeah? How many of them are following me?” Shira asked half-heartedly.</p>\n<p>“What? You don’t believe them Big-Boobed Sect always spying on us?”</p>\n<p>Shira shrugged. Good-Natured Spirit was right--the boy didn’t believe his ramblings about all-girl sect always hiding in Badril Village’s shadows, especially with those padded words about them being beautiful and having bountiful bodies. He didn’t believe it because he still got some common sense. Not to mention hidden sects, even some decent clans and schools wouldn’t bother with ordinary places like Badril Village.</p>\n<p>And thus as he had feared, the market was already crowded by then. The moment Shira realized it, Good-Natured Spirit already drifted away by the sight of excitement in gambling dens and beautiful young wives from Elzhier Family sold street foods. As it turned out, it was stamped on the Nalaq’s mind to get off Shira as soon as they came to the market lest the boy’d use him for errands one way or another. The peddler Shira acquainted with was getting a good crowd as he laid his wares behind his wagon.</p>\n<p>“Monkey!”</p>\n<p>The peddler behind the wares turned his head. He had a funny face, a rare trait that made him resemble a monkey. And there was no coincidence everyone called him Monkey. When Monkey slightly wandered his eyes through the crowd and saw Shira, he waved his hands to the grunting customers and told them he’d close his shop for a while.</p>\n<p>“Well, well, isn’t this our Young Master Shira blessing us with his presence?” the smiling Monkey briskly approached as he rubbed his palms excitedly. “Can I help you young master?”</p>\n<p>Shira stepped back when Monkey got too close. “Monkey, you better stop being creepy whenever I come visit you.”</p>\n<p>“You hurt me, young master. There’s nothing creepy about our business relationship.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, it’s your face. Don’t make me regret selling my painting to you.”</p>\n<p>“Haha, surely you jest, Young Master Shira--I’m trying my best to maintain a professional face from now on!” Monkey said that then immediately took a small peek at the content. “Your skill is just getting better and better, master. I’m sure this will sell well, Master!”</p>\n<p>“What’s with the master thing?”</p>\n<p>“How dare for me to call you ‘Young Master’ while you yourself are already an expert at this stage?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t want our relationship getting creepier than it already is,” Shira said, then he took out a pouch of coins. “Anyways, I got an errand from my aunt, so give me the thirteen dried spices worth all this money.”</p>\n<p>“What kind of spice?”</p>\n<p>“All kinds of spices.”</p>\n<p>“Of course, of course, I’ll give you a discount, just to celebrate your improvement in the path of drawing, Master.”</p>\n<p>By the time Shira got himself a basketful of spices, Monkey’s grin getting more annoying. The stereotypical fat and slimy merchants looked innocent compared to him. After Shira threw a frowning glance at him, he <em>reluctantly</em> admitted, “Young master may not know this, but recently I’ve got an Alchemist partner with me who was trying to be independent from his family,” he said. “And I must tell you, young master, this family is a many-hundreds of years Alchemists family, and you also must know he’s not kicked out of incompetente--”</p>\n<p>Shira cut his roundabout pitching. “You want me to back the Alchemist?”</p>\n<p>“Mmm...yes….” Monkey nodded with a wry smile.</p>\n<p>The boy’s eyes wandered through the peddler’s wares before looked at him in the eyes. “Even I must tread through the game of cat and dog with the elders because of the rules,” he explained to Monkey, who in turn, could only smile helplessly.</p>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>Mossack’s custom dictates children who haven’t gone through their coming of age ceremony--usually at the age of sixteen--to not being involved in politics and commerce. This is the reason why Shira--as he mostly acquired money winning through streaks of chess games with Good-Natured Spirit--couldn’t recklessly flaunt his personal wealth in public.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>The risk of having a relationship gone sour with this young master, Monkey knew that. It was unlikely for an upstart peddler to be relied on by a future patriarch of a big family, and he wholeheartedly believed it was unwise to create a trivial misunderstanding with Young Master Shira Yashura. After all, it was only one year until Shira would have his own coming of age ceremony. Therefore, Monkey didn’t want to impose on the Young Master’s kindness too much and quickly changed the topic with something he’d prepared beforehand.</p>\n<p>“This is a <b>Boost Elixir</b> concocted by my partner. He might not a 2nd-Tier Alchemist yet but I assure you, Young Master Shira, the elixir’s potent power won’t lose against any experts you’ll find anywhere!” Monkey said with his over-excited sales pitch, which made him look more funny than usual, “This humble bottle was scientifically proven to increase a person’s level as long as he is below the age of twenty! To date, this Boost Elixir has 100% effectiveness in increasing the user’s level! Young master, you are very lucky--you can have this miraculous elixir just for half of the original price today!”</p>\n<p>Though it was clear Monkey meant no harm, Shira narrowed his eyes at the pedder.</p>\n<p>“Did someone pay you to make me drink it?” he asked suspiciously.</p>\n<p>“You jest again, Young Master… ha ha… haaa….” Monkey awkwardly laughed as he tried to hide his dampened enthusiasm. “Why don’t you try it first, Young Master Shira. You don’t have to pay if you didn’t get to graduate from Level 3 Novice.”</p>\n<p>Eventually, Shira drank the Boost Elixir within a gulp, not because he believed its miraculous effect, but because he was weak for free and discounted goods.</p>\n<p>“Your EXP bar didn’t even budge a little,” Monkey muttered with a meek voice.</p>\n<p>“The liquid is surprisingly well made though. Is this really made by someone you know?”</p>\n<p>“I said before, Young Master. The one who made this hailed from an old Alchemist family that even outside South Tiramikal Kingdom their last name still can be a pretty big deal. I’m pretty confident that--normally--this elixir will have a 100% success rate for leveling up whoever drinks it!”</p>\n<p>“Such a confident boast. Are you perhaps implying that my case is not <em>normally</em>?”</p>\n<p>“He hehe, you surely joke. You know that I don’t mean any harm, young master.”</p>\n<p>Shira of course knew it. And the other thing he also knew, that if it was a really impressive elixir he just drank by now, the usual Monkey wouldn’t utter a single phrase of the word “free”, regardless how many times the elixir failed to deliver its promise.</p>\n<p>Shira looked at Monkey suspiciously, “You’re Monkey, aren’t you? Not someone brainwashed by my family’s enemy or something like that? You know, by vampires.”</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira… now your joke is not even funny--something like a poor peddler to be brainwashed only appears in stories. Vampires are some unfounded folklore.”</p>\n<p>“Monkey I know is stupid. If not brainwashed, then he definitely manipulated to sell a fake elixir to someone from big families.”</p>\n<p>Before Monkey was able to retort that, a cold voice came from the wagon. “Young Master Yashura, I don’t mind if you pinpoint Monkey’s stupidity and make assumptions about him muchever you want. But to call my elixir is fake, I can’t stand and watch around anymore.”</p>\n<p>A man appeared from the wagon Monkey had, had an appearance of the stereotypical scholar Shira had in mind--though, by the way he crossed his arms pompously, he seemed to have a pride worthy of someone hailed from big families.</p>\n<p>“You’re the Alchemist?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, you call me Snake--don’t ask for my real name,” the Alchemist said.</p>\n<p>One would hide his name if he didn’t want to be associated with his family anymore. So Shira didn’t ask. He looked at the scholarly Alchemist, then at the peddler. One was the Snake and the other one was the Monkey.</p>\n<p>Shira found some sort of strange camradice between them. “I see, so both of you decided to be a partner for life.”</p>\n<p>“Not for life, no. Spare me. It’s better for me to ditch this stupid ape as soon as he outlives his usefulness.”</p>\n<p>“Heey! Don’t say ditching in front of me!” Monkey protested. Snake ignored him without pretense, making the impression that this scene was ordinary for them.</p>\n<p>Shira then asked Snake straightforwardly.</p>\n<p>“What kind of elixir is this?”</p>\n<p>“Didn’t Monkey tell you? A Boost Elixir. My latest masterpiece,” Snake replied.</p>\n<p>“You’re aware that your partner tried to sell your masterpiece at a half price, right? I don’t even have to pay, it was what he said before.”</p>\n<p>“It was my idea,” Snake said. “This is a simple business hack. I’m confident about my concoctions. After all, I experimented heavily on human anatomy--too heavy, even, to the point folks in my family want me gone for good. I’ve got nothing to lose here. That bottle is a prototype; it cost a lot so I planned to price it a lot.”</p>\n<p>“You want to use my bad reputation as a stepping stone, don’t you?” Shira asked with a sour smile.</p>\n<p>“Yes. Do you mind?”</p>\n<p>“No, I’d gladly make profit out of those trash talking they did behind my back--though, it seems you picked the wrong guinea pig to be your mascot for your ‘business hack’,” Shira said with a wry smile.</p>\n<p>Monkey nodded weakly. As a peddler from outside the village, he was always bothered by how nasty rumors could be, especially with some acquaintance he depended on sometimes as an important business partner.</p>\n<p>Seeing that they no longer had things to chat about, Shira said to them he’d consider putting some resources if he managed to gain some nod from the family elders after he went through the coming-of-age ceremony next year. And now that he finished selling Good-Natured Spirit’s rejected commision and completed the errand his aunt gave him, Shira then bid farewell to the two animal-nicknamed gentlemen.</p>\n<p>“Please wait, Young Master Shira.”</p>\n<p>Shira turned back his head again and found Snake, the one who called him, ran back to Monkey’s wagon to grab something.</p>\n<p>“Try to drink this one,” Snake said after trotting back hurriedly. “It’s alright, you don’t have to pay for this time too.”</p>\n<p>The current elixir Snake took out was the exact opposite from the previous one. Its container was beautiful and high-class, but the content was muddy and very low in quality. Hearing that this one was also free, Shira didn’t hesitate to drink it.</p>\n<p>The after taste was incredibly sour. Unlike any other bitter concocted elixirs or potions he ever drank. Although not much, Shira could feel his body warming up. He was surprised at the unexpected reaction.</p>\n<p>“Oohhhh!!!” Monkey cried as his eyes glued at Shira’s Status Window. “The EXP bar moved!”</p>\n<p>“What?” the surprised Shira glanced at Snake and asked slowly, “This one’s free, right?”</p>\n<p>It was in a single flash Shira did catch a strange dumbfoundedness in Snake eyes, like the result even came more shocking than him than either of Shira and Monkey. Yet the moment after he promptly regained his stoic exposure, then said to Shira, “Don’t worry, I don’t plan to take back my words,”</p>\n<p>The odd Alchemist put his hands at his back and walked back to his wagon. Before he climbed the wagon, he once again glanced at Shira, looking in a state of half-disbelief like expression</p>\n<p>As Snake disappeared into the wagon, Shira and Monkey exchanged glances.</p>\n<p>“He still has that kind of face even though he promises it to be free? You sure do have an odd friend.” Shira said.</p>\n<p>Monkey grinned. “Though an oddball, I never seen anyone with more talent in alchemy than him, like, ever.”</p>\n<p>After leaving Monkey to continue his stall, Shira saw Good-Natured Spirit again when he visited a food stall not far from Monkey’s wagon. He asked what he was doing, and the Nalaq told him there was a fool who bet a lot and won a lot in the gambling games. To lose against in gambling against someone with Good-Natured Spirit’s caliber, really--Shira sighed--he couldn’t wait for his coming-of-age ceremony next year so he too could farm on these gullible people in some friendly matches--just like what he did with Good-Natured Spirit for this past one year.</p>\n<p>“You know,” munching on some satays he bought from the market, Shira muttered when he headed home along with Good-Natured Spirit, “just then I drank this elixir that really could boost my EXP a little. I don’t know how the guy concocts it, but I have the feeling that I just drink some very expensive elixir for free.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, yeah?”</p>\n<p>On the way back to Yashura Family Shira told the Nalaq spirit about the Alchemist and his elixirs. He also told him that his status that usually wouldn’t react to normal elixirs this time moved a bit after he drank a strange low-quality elixir.</p>\n<p>“That Alchemist must be a nerd to be that sharp,” Good-Natured Spirit said as he floated lazily beside the boy.</p>\n<p>“He looks like that too. The peddler he partnered with also has some good sense in him. So I thought it’s not a loss for me to use all those foreign coins I got from you to invest on them for the next year.”</p>\n<p>“Hmm,” Good-Natured Spirit crossed his arms. “I think you should be worried.”</p>\n<p>“Worried? Why?”</p>\n<p>“You said that nerd Alchemist was the one who pushed that low-quality elixir to you, right?”</p>\n<p>“I got to drink that for free,” Shira emphasized.</p>\n<p>“He realized one little secret about you then,” Good-Natured Spirit said.</p>\n<p>Shira stopped walking. He looked at him with his head tilted.</p>\n<p>“What secret?”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit who floated before, spoke again.</p>\n<p>“You shouldn’t worry about it too much for now, brat. But, I advise you, if you are still holding dear for your lazy, peaceful village life, you should turn back and kill him right now.”</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-5/chapter-3-5":"<p>What the Nalaq told Shira lingered in his mind. Good-Natured Spirit blurted something about killing someone as if it was something trivial that could popped out easily in normal conversation. To kill someone after finding out his secret--what kind of secret he needed to protect anyway? A secret he never wanted people to know the fact he was drawing semi-porns for money. But he wasn’t that insecure to kill someone over a petty secret like that? That would be him being not right in the head. The more he thought about Good-Natured Spirit’s remark, the more it disturbed him. Especially right now, when his hands painted in red, bathed in blood. When he just did an act of actual killing.</p>\n<p>“Something on your mind, Young Master Shira?” a rough voice disturbed his train of thought.</p>\n<p>“Ah,” Shira looked at a burly man, an experienced hunter, who called him.</p>\n<p>The man’s body even drenched in thicker blood than him. One would get easily nauseated by the sight of it. Yet it didn’t make the boy flinched, as he was expecting the experience for a few months already.</p>\n<p>“Here. Look at his gut. Spilling out his innards with your own hands might be a good experience for you, young master.”</p>\n<p>The hunter spun a sharp dagger, holding it by the tip of its blade, having a gesture of offering it to his young master.</p>\n<p>“Is that okay? I even had trouble when skinning the hide,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>He’d rather not, to be honest, since splitting a goat’s gut could be messy if he did it crudely. Even if he was the young master of the family, when messing with the raw meat, not even his uncle could save him from the aunties’ nagging. Shira Yashura was nearly sixteen, almost reaching adulthood, so he had to participate in butchering goats; it was a quite tasking task, but was easy enough compared to butchering cows he had to do in a few years. But for the fifteen years old young master, getting the hang of the butchering knife’s handle was plenty of experience already for him.</p>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>As the custom dictates, every month in ngajen ceremony preparation, the boys will have to deal with cows and goats while the girls help aunties plucking chickens’ and ducks’ feathers. Whether the gatekeepers' children or the family’s next heirs, all of them are required to do it every time a major ceremony approaches.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>After doing his part in butchering a goat Shira immediately took a bath to remove the bloody pungent. On a whim he then strolled to the kitchen to grab some snacks. There he witnessed how all the coconuts he and his uncle shred already transformed into delicious foods; rendang, Bulayak satay, coconut satay, spicy curry, many other mouth drolling coconut cuisines. The coconut loving uncle was all smiles and gave him a big portion of the famous beef cuisine the locals called rendang--which, normally, even for a young master like Shira would get to eat rendang once every few months. But with enough wit and experience in currying favor with his uncle, he got to taste those delicious food handed down by his uncle, the Chief Chef, personally.</p>\n<p>“Shira my boy,” Patriarch Shuro said to his nephew who was squatting below the shadow of a thick pillar, happily munching on his rendang, “you’re going to visit Malikh Family tonight. Keep a good check on your cousin. Don’t embarrass Yashura Family and present our rendang_ _for their main family.”</p>\n<p>“Sure.”</p>\n<hr>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>Domesticated cows were less in numbers than goats in Badril Village, so meals from cows, not including the innards which could be made into popular but cheap cuisines, like only served for village big shots or important visitors during the ngajen ceremony.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>Laughters and chatters made the night more merry than any other thay of the month. It was brighter than usual, as villagers came out of their house to set up big braziers to light the road between the families that were holding festives. From one hundred meters away, through the thick wall of the big families, the mouth-watering aroma of prepared food wafted through the air as if they informally invited people to come and to taste the delicacy these big families had. The change in scenery upon the arrival of the night signaled the nigh of Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>Yashura Family, the oldest family around, was known to have the best food amongst all families in Badril Village, while Elzhier Family known as the family that always threw the biggest party post-ceremony--Elzhier Family’s maidservants were beautiful and they’d show off their voluptuous bodies every single ngajen ceremony. Particularly this month however, everyone was anticipating the ceremony thrown by Malikh Family; for two years since the young lady’s absence they threw nothing more than mediocre festivities, her return was to be seen as their revival on the village’s political stage. And from how big their arrangement looked like, it seemed Malikh Family didn’t plan to fail everyone’s expectations.</p>\n<p>Shira Yashura wore the same suit he got from his uncle on his fifteenth birthday. It was the usual suit he’d wear whenever a ceremony was held. His uncle bought it from a merchant who had connections outside the kingdom, which was pretty good since the fabric wasn’t stiff, but could get unbearably itchy in places he didn’t want to scratch whenever there were people around. The obvious part missing from the wears his peers were wearing was beast pelts.</p>\n<p>Pelts from ferocious beasts were known for irrefutable proof for boys’ courage and manliness. As many young gentlemen of Badril Village wore on their necks, always looking for the opportunity to show off the trophy of their preys to girls--which translated as fashionable fads for boys who wanted to get laids.</p>\n<p>Of course, Shira, as part of the dull and no-nonsense camp of the boys in Badril Village, never had participated in that kind of indecent business. He was so dull that the only girl who would accompany him to attend ceremonies was his cousin Mila--who, even though her face was quite pretty, also happened to be in terrible luck for romance.</p>\n<p>“No matter how many times I see it, it’s always impressive to see how fast you wrap all these banana leaves,” Shira commented as he watched how Mila wrapped rendang with banana leaves. She was very good at it, comparable to the aunties’ skills that had been forged day and night in the family’s kitchen.</p>\n<p>“You talking? You’ve done your training with the family's sword technique, I assume?” Mila said with her lips pouted. Shira thought it was unusual for Mila didn’t nag her mouth off immediately when she saw him. He saw a sword wrapped in cloth near Mila. His face immediately twisted in a troubled look.</p>\n<p>“I won’t bring that thing,” he protested.</p>\n<p>“You--” Mila hissed.</p>\n<p>“What should I do with a sword inside another family’s ceremony?” Shira said. The sword was his father’s, and that was his reason he didn’t want to use it. “Look, I can only draw the blade from the sheath at most. Without a proper amount of Strength attribute I can’t swing this properly. It rejects my mana. I’d make a fool out of myself if that happened.”</p>\n<p>“That’s because you were stupidly increasing your Wisdom instead of, that’s why you--arghh! Just forget about it! I know you’re trying to make excuses! Since you’re so weak all we can do is flaunting around your father’s reputation. We’ve got to remind people that our Yashura Family’s not to mess with. Here, just slip this fucking sword in your belt.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, this is embarrassing. Those rumors are about to get worse tonight,” Shira said with a sigh. His reputation as a trash talent was annoying enough, added this shameless act of throwing his weight around, he’d become more reluctant to show his face in the public later on. But still he unwillingly slipped the sword in his belt.</p>\n<p>Mila snorted. She ignored the complaint. Right now she could care less about the rumors about her cousin. What she had to prioritize tonight was the bad premonition she had about Bhela Malikh’s short hair--nobody believed her when she said that Bhela was being a slut for cutting her hair short in spite of her being in an engagement. While her hands craftly knotted the rendang wrapped in banana leaves with a rope made with dried coconut leaves, she suddenly had a cold smile; the image of those impudent Malikhs shuddering under the famous sword of Yashura Family’s Unique Class, Jhuro Yashura the Blackfang Swordsman, entertained her she began to chuckle coldly.</p>\n<p>“Huhuhu… just you wait you bitch…”</p>\n<p>Shira stepped back. He had the hunch he should keep a distance away from his current cousin right now.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Every month, for every family in Badril Village, cooking during the Ngajen Ceremony was always a time rushing hectic. Even more in Malikh Family this time. Since the amount of food they had to deliver before the ceremony started more than twice the amount they made last month, most of the aunties in duty were cooking outdoors. The smoke from the half-dried firewood would be too unbearable for the eyes if all of them cooked in one cramped place. Fortunately, most of the dishes were already cooked and sent to the courtyard, so the only people who were still on duty preparing food were a small number of aunties and maidservants.</p>\n<p>The young maidservants were pale from tiredness but they couldn’t afford to slack in this one Ngajen Ceremony. The usual noisy aunties, they didn’t even show a sign of wanting to rest. Nobody could beat the resilience of the kitchen-duty armies when it came to preparing for a loadful of party’s foods.</p>\n<p>Usually, the one who would supervise these spartan cooking aunties would be the patriarch’s wife, Bhela’s mother. It was already a long-held tradition in the village for the patriarch to cook for the family’s important guests as the Chief Chef, while the wife supported him by supervising the aunties and maidservants. In Ngajen Ceremony this month, however, Bhela’s mother holed herself to accompany the husband on his ill-bed.</p>\n<p>She was not in the mood to meet with people. So Bhela stepped in to fill her position.</p>\n<p>Back when she was little Bhela often followed her mother working during the ngajen ceremony, she knew what she had to do by the back of her hand. In usage of salt, for example, she knew down to the tiniest detail of how much salt should be applied to different kinds of cuisines. She also instructed the inexperienced maidservants who were in charge of cooking side dishes so the overall quality of the feast would be balanced. Bhela Malikh didn’t betray everyone’s expectations about her. She did her work splendidly.</p>\n<p>However, there was a matter she saw that didn’t make her happy. The largest furnace that was usually reserved for the Chief Chef, today was used by an old man from the outer family. A great cook, the old man was. Known for his vast experience in handling the family’s food stalls for years. The problem was his common status. Without at least an elder status made it awkward for him to cook as the Chief Chef in this kitchen, even if he was a mere proxy. Bhela wondered whether the one who took the charge when her parents were unavailable knew the risk of being laughed at and criticized by the other two big families--especially now that the relationship between Yashura and Malikh wasn’t that good like before.</p>\n<p>“Young lady, the day’s getting dark, you should take a bath now and prepare yourself for the ceremony,” an aunty said to Bhela.</p>\n<p>“Yes, young lady is no longer a little girl, so making you pretty will take a while,” an early twenty maidservant added from the side. She continued, “The new girls should be able to complete the foods since you directed them a lot. Please don’t worry about us.”</p>\n<p>“I’m relieved to hear that,” Bhela said. Not yet three seconds later her eyes wandered to the old cook again. She couldn’t hide her frown.</p>\n<p>“Something the matter, Young Lady Bhela?”</p>\n<p>“Yes. Maybe it’s a misunderstanding on my part but… I can’t see the elder who would substitute my father as the Chief Chef.”</p>\n<p>Hearing Bhela said her concern, the aunties and the maidservants averted eyes with their young lady with troubled faces. Bhela then understood there was something shady going on.</p>\n<p>Her suspicion turned worse when she saw a young man in his twenties leading four manservants with him. When the aunties were working in the kitchen, it was an unspoken rule for unrelated adult men not to approach, but the battle-hardened aunties that normally were ferocious in defending their territories were all silent in welcoming the cocky visitors. It wasn’t surprising to Bhela that all of them came from Elder Jhamil’s faction.</p>\n<p>“Why aren’t you ready yet, old worm?!”</p>\n<p>“I am sorry, young elder… some dish cannot be rushed so I prepared some to--”</p>\n<p><em>Slap!!</em></p>\n<p>The slapping sound echoed in the kitchen. The room descended into a dead silent. The old cook was trembling; he lowered his head and covered the cheek that just got slapped but everyone could see the blood on the corner of his mouth. Bhela recollected her memory, and finally remembered the arrogant young man was actually Elder Jhamil’s own son.</p>\n<p>“Shit!” Elder Jhamil’s son swore, “those councils from Village Hall came. We must complete the set before too long! Those people are the ones who usually have the heaviest voice when valuing Ngajen Ceremony dishes!”</p>\n<p>One follower quipped, “Young elder is right. This old worm can’t cook shit! If this goes on, the only things the Village Hall council will remember about Elder Jhamil’s cooking is that we Malikhs cook as slow as snail!”</p>\n<p>The frown on Bhela’s face became deeper. Young elder? Before she went out for the seminars that lasted two years, this man, son of Elder Jhamil, merely a family member with a post within the family’s business. And something else that disturbed her was how she couldn’t see how the blurted about Elder Jhamil’s cooking, the one who worked in the kitchen all day, didn’t see the said elder even once today.</p>\n<p>Bhela still held her silent. But her eyes were cold and sharp judging people and the situation. The aunties and the maidservants, though they looked sympathetic with the old man, were afraid to go against Elder Jhamil’s son. Maybe because the lack of resistance Elder Jhamil’s son dared to do a taboo known in the kitchen--swapping food that wrapped in banana leaves with ceramic plates, garnished a bit, and called it the Chief Chef’s cuisine.</p>\n<p>“No, young elder!” a brave middle-aged aunty stepped forward, “you can’t do that!”</p>\n<p>“Why not?” one follower sneered in Elder Jhamil’s son’s place. “This one also got beef, isn’t it? We need to quickly serve the Chief Chef cuisine to the people from Village Hall councils.”</p>\n<p>“Exactly because they are from the Village Hall council--just from inferior cuts of the beef they’d know the dishes have been swapped! You’ll tarnish Malikh Family’s honor if people knew you were fooling--”</p>\n<p>“Fooling?!” Elder Jhamil roared.</p>\n<p>The young elder raised his hand, though the aunty who complained quickly hid back behind the maidservants. Elder Jhamil’s son then rampaged into a series of barking, yelling and threatening the aunties to cut their salary just because his mood was spoiled.</p>\n<p>His words scared all the girls and the women inside the kitchen. All except Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>After they were done swapping the foods, the young elder led his men out of the kitchen with great swagger. The young elder stopped at the door, turned around, and gave the old cook one last ultimatum: “There’ll be a noble in the ceremony so we need rendang for the main course. So go make it, old worm. You know what’s gonna happen if you couldn’t deliver, don’t you?”</p>\n<p>The old man trembled. Even the eyes on the aunties couldn’t help but shake at the threat. There was now way they could prepare rendang with only two hours remaining until the Ngajen Ceremony started.</p>\n<p>After that situation calmed down. The aunties and the maidservants went back to work. Some of them still exchanged whispered and gossiped amongst themselves. But when Bhela approached, immediately they stopped and pretended nothing happened.</p>\n<p>“Young lady…” a pudgy aunty came to her, the one who stood up against the young elder from before.</p>\n<p>“Aunty?”</p>\n<p>“We are sorry… we’ve had no meaning to show you that embarrassing scene.”</p>\n<p>Bhela shook her head. “No, I’m one from the main family bloodline; I should've been the one who stood up to him instead of hiding behind everyone.”</p>\n<p>The aunty knew the young lady didn’t say a word before because the girl wanted to know the situation. Some other middle-aged aunties who were close with Madam Malikh also knew more or less Bhela’s detached wait-and-see attitude, so no one really would blame her even if she didn’t say a word before--especially since she had just returned from overseas. The pudgy aunty tugged on Bhela’s sleeve, whispered to her ear, “Young Lady Bhela, we know you’re concerned. But we’ve already gotten used to it. You’re still young. Your future is brighter than everyone else in the family, Young Lady Bhela. It’s better to endure than pointlessly making enemies.”</p>\n<p>“This isn’t pointless,” Bhela said. She then grabbed the nearest apron and wore it. Her father was the patriarch. And she wasn’t a poster girl to draw everyone’s attention to the family.</p>\n<p>The pudgy aunty wanted to say something again. But words stuck on her throat, she closed her mouth as soon as she opened it.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the old man began to pick some mature coconut and shredded it listlessly. He got more than four decades of handling food stalls for Malikh Family, he wasn’t a stranger at cooking rendang. But he already gave up on finishing one for tonight’s Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>“Uncle, I’ll take it from here,” Bhela said as she approached the weary old man.</p>\n<p>“Ahh, yes?” the old man was started. The girl came with an apron and common garment, had fair and beautiful skin, as well clear and articulate voice; a maidservant from the inner family was the first one that came to his mind. But only when he noticed even the aunties were respectful to her and her striking bob-cut short hair that the old man began drenched in cold sweat.</p>\n<p>“I said, uncle,” Bhela repeated, “I’ll take it from here. You can rest now.”</p>\n<p>The old man vigorously shook his head.</p>\n<p>“Please Young Lady Bhela… please spare this old bone….”</p>\n<p>“This is originally my father’s post, uncle. You’ll have to be at least an elder and write your name in council’s ledger to be a substitute for my father.”</p>\n<p>The old man wanted to break into a tearless cry. This is worse than when he faced Elder Jhamil’s son's harassment before. The most thing he was afraid of was the news of Elder Jhamil using him as Chief Chef behind the scene to reach the ears of the main family. And now that Bhela Malikh was here, there was nothing he could do but to resign his life to fate.</p>\n<p>“Y-young lady!” a maidservant yelled, “you can’t!”</p>\n<p>“Who says I can’t?” Bhela asked sharply.</p>\n<p>An aunty, who had a stern-looking face, said, “You can’t cook for the main course, young lady. In case of a patriarch's absence, usually one of the elders who’s going to take his place. There’s no rule saying it’s okay for women to do it.”</p>\n<p>“Then, I’m going to ask,” from the aunty, Bhela threw her glance toward the old man, “are you an elder cooking here to substitute my father as a cook, uncle?”</p>\n<p>The old man’s face turned pale. Whichever the answer of that question would lead him to the road of punishment. All of the sudden, he became a mute.</p>\n<p>Because she had the most standing, nobody made a sound when Young Lady Bhela Malikh asked them to fetch chickens and spices for her.</p>\n<p>Not long after, the story about how the Young Lady of Malikh Family wanted to substitute her father spread like a wildfire. Never in Badril Village’s history would a young lady do that. A crowd of curious males, mostly the youngsters from main and outer of Malikh Family, surrounded the kitchen as they wanted to catch a glimpse of how their beautiful young lady recklessly challenged the custom by her own. The boys sighed in admiration. Bhela Malikh was essentially an Archer at heart. But the way she handled a blade, even if it was a kitchen knife, was skillful and graceful, as every time her slim wrist stopped moving from cutting down a vegetable, a wave of gulping could be heard. The boys couldn’t take their eyes from her. The reckless and brave young lady was simply too charming.</p>\n<p>“Did you know that foreigners often confuse rendang as dried curry?” Bhela said to one maidservant who stared at the way she cooked. “Curry leaves originated from an area close to western Haldeen lands, so many local Mossacks sailed the sea to try their luck making it big working for western empires.”</p>\n<p>The usual aloof Bhela unusually was talkative when she was cooking, which was quite a big surprise for people who were watching. She explained to the clueless maidservants how, during her two years travelling in seminars from countries to countries, found many noble owned restaurants claimed to serve rendang but turned out to be dried curry. All the while sharply focused on doing her cooking duty.</p>\n<p>“Young lady!” from the crowd came out an angry bald man. He was Elder Jhamil. “W-what are you doing there?”</p>\n<p>“I’m cooking,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“But you can’t work there!” Elder Jhamil yelled. “No woman can substitute for patriarch! That’s against the rule!”</p>\n<p>“I don’t recall we have a rule like that.”</p>\n<p>“If you know why you still stand there?”</p>\n<p>“Neither do I recall a rule for an elder to use a stand-in for the Chief Chef position.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s face turned weird as if he suddenly got constipated. Many of the youngsters didn’t catch Bhela’s remarks nor they cared too much about it, but some in the crowd were nodding knowingly, as many of them were familiar with how shady Elder Jhamil was doing things.</p>\n<p>As the bald elder’s head was racing fast looking for an answer to defuse the young lady’s claim, suddenly, a loud roar exploded behind him.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela, who do you think you are? Just because your father is the family’s patriarch you think you can do whatever you want?!”</p>\n<p>The faces of aunties and the maidservants twitched. They witnessed how the young elder harassed the old man before, so they were itching to throw back the same question at him instead, though no more brave aunties dared to cause more troubles.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s son continued, “The ingredient for making Chief dishes takes money, young lady. Not even the patriarch himself has the daring to use coins from the treasury for himself. Do you want to embarrass your parents that much?”</p>\n<p>“I’m not making this food for myself nor I cook for my father. It’s for the guests. And I provided the spices and the foreign curry leaves by myself,” Bhela said. Some maidservants behind her nodded nervously as Bhela indeed ordered them to fetch spices from the personal kitchen in the main family’s residential area.</p>\n<p>In spite of that, the young elder kept pushing on with nasty smile on his face.</p>\n<p>“What about the chicken, young lady? They cost money! What do you say about that, huh?”</p>\n<p>Behind Bhela, the aunties, even the maidservants, were whispering at each other on how ridiculous it was to question the sole young generation of Malikh Family main bloodline over some chickens. Even Bhela, the young lady in question, would only glanced at the troubled expression of Elder Jhamil.</p>\n<p>“I will pay for the chicken,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Ha? Pay? With what? Your father’s money? Can’t a sick person even pay the cost of the foods for ngajen ceremony all by himself?”</p>\n<p>“No need to bring my father’s name here.” Bhela said with a dangerously cold tone.</p>\n<p>The chillness in her eyes was telling that she really did hate people bringing her parents’ name in bad faith. After hearing gasps of surprise from people that didn’t expect the usually silent young lady could utter something with such a biting tone, she sighed, said with an explanation, “I got a dress as a gift from a certain person who has too much money in his pocket. He said the dress is so valuable even the princesses wear them in parties. It should cover the cost of these chickens I’m going to cook if I sell the dress right here right now.”</p>\n<p>Bhela then tilted her head and glanced at the bald elder.</p>\n<p>“Am I right, Elder Jhamil?”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil wanted to maintain his smile, but his face went stiff as stone. He was trembling inside for knowing that the dress he acquired with a large sum of money and with his best connection, valued the same as some mere village chickens in Bhela’s eyes.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, his son, who was taken aback for a bit from the cold remark Bhela had said earlier, recovered, began to yell again, “Ha! Did you not train your brain when you were overseas, my young lady? The same dress princesses wear in parties? Only someone dumb believe that! Hah! Obviously you’ve been lied to! You’ve been crooked, young lady, crooked--”</p>\n<p><em>Paak!</em></p>\n<p>From behind, the already red-faced Elder Jhamil smacked his son’s head. “You’ve been rude to Young Lady Bhela, you dumbskull! You have to apologize! Young lady can’t bear to hear it anymore!”</p>\n<p>While in fact it was him who couldn’t bear to hear being called a crook.</p>\n<p>“Apologize!” Elder Jhamil roared.</p>\n<p><em>Splash!</em></p>\n<p>The pair father and son’s performance didn’t amuse Bhela, however. With the lid in her hand, Bhela scooped boiling curry broth and splashed it to their direction. Surprised, the stupid young elder swore with nasty words while his father cried in high-pitched voice.</p>\n<p>“Please get out,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil laughed wryly.</p>\n<p>“Please don’t be like that, young lady. I know my son doesn't have the best education but--”</p>\n<p><em>Splash!!</em></p>\n<p>Bhela waved the cooking lid once again as soon as Elder Jhamil stepped forward. The hot water splashed on his expensive boots. This time, while he didn’t expect for Bhela splashing hot water at him again, he wasn’t freaking out. It seemed his plan to make the young lady behave a little backfiring instead. His face turned solemn.</p>\n<p>“Young lady…”</p>\n<p>“I’m not going to say it thrice--everyone who has nothing to do in the kitchen, please get out,” Bhela said. “Or else--”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The major families’ lands were astonishingly spacious and complex, their walls were thick and tall, therefore each of them employed a few stationary guards for the main gate as gatekeepers. These gatekeepers, though usually filled by members of the outer part of the families, their duty were significantly more important than others since they represented the face of the family they served. So they always maintain polite gestures to everyone who came through their gate, either commoners or rich people from big families. Yet when Shira and Mila arrived the Malikh Family’s gatekeepers didn’t even hide their scoffs.</p>\n<p>“Ridiculous!” she hissed with a face boiled in anger, “even lowly gatekeepers are looking down on us!”</p>\n<p>“Don’t bother with them,” Shira said. Unlike his cousin’s furious temper, his flair seemed like he shrugged the blatant disrespect, as the holder of “Eternal Novice” title he was already numb by how people were talking behind his back.</p>\n<p>“If your father was here they’d bow their asses as soon as they saw us Yashura coming.”</p>\n<p>Shira shrugged his shoulders again.</p>\n<p>Still seething in anger, Mila cast her eyes on the banana leaves wrapped food in Shira’s hands. “Who should we give the rendang to?” she asked.</p>\n<p>“Let’s just give it to a random servant.” Then Shira called a maidservant who was carrying a tray full of food. “Excuse me!”</p>\n<p>“Yes? What can I help y--” The moment this maidservant turned her head and saw Shira’s face, she immediately threw back her eyes and escaped with hurried trot, pretending she saw nothing.</p>\n<p>“The fuck?!” Mila was flastergabbed, didn’t know what to say.</p>\n<p>Later on Shira and Mila realized how unpopular Yashura Family was to the current Malikhs, even the servants who usually held no voice in the family were avoiding the pair of cousins like plague. Their attitude especially worsened when it came to Shira Yashura.</p>\n<p>“Look there,” someone whispered amongst the guests, “Yashura Family send their eldest young miss and the young master! Out of all the Ngajen Ceremony, they choose tonight to show their faces--pretty obvious, eh? Bet they’re drooling to get another Unique Class after knowing our Young Lady Bhela’s real talent tonight!”</p>\n<p>Someone else agreed and replied, “With that kind of trash as their young master, they’d be dreamin’ to get even a touch of our Young Lady Bhela. Pueh!”</p>\n<p>Hearing the muffled disdain, Mila Yashura whirled her body, glaring people with eagle eyes. “Who said that?!” she growled.</p>\n<p>“Mila…” Shira held her shoulder.</p>\n<p>“The fuckers don’t even put our Yashura Family in their eyes. Just because shitty rumors about Unique Class they started to feel high and mighty, eh?”</p>\n<p>“Just let go, Uncle Shuro didn’t send us here to start troubles,” Shira said. “All we need to do is to show our faces here and give them our rendang. It’s not our problem whether they welcome our good intention with grace or not.”</p>\n<p>Though Shira said that, he secretly hoped Malikh Family would grow too proud to receive it--all so he had an excuse to keep his uncle’s rendang for himself.</p>\n<p>A commotion arose. People hussing here and there with excitement. When Shira and Mila wanted to know what was going on, a parade of beautiful young women glittering and stealing the whole show came from inside of Malikh Family’s hall. Leading them was a short-haired young beauty, face as icy as an ice sculpture, the recent name that everyone had been talking about these days, Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>It was clear from the way Bhela positioned herself she represented the family as the ceremony’s Chief Chef.</p>\n<p>“Whoa, so Malikh Family let her do that,” Shira murmured.</p>\n<p>Not to mention being the Chief Chef--the most Shira did in his family’s kitchen was helping his uncle, helping him shred coconuts. They were at the same age, but the same old Shira still practiced butchering goats while the supposed fiancée of his was climbing the social ladder. Even Mila was angry by the special treatment Malikh Family gave to their young lady.</p>\n<p>“Sup, young master!” from behind a voice called him.</p>\n<p>Shira turned around, found the one who greeted him was Monkey.</p>\n<p>“Who?” Mila asked Shira as the stranger with a monkey-like face approaching.</p>\n<p>“This one is called by the name of Monkey, young lady,” Monkey, with his self-trained Mossack’s style bowing gesture, introduced himself smoothly.</p>\n<p>Mila hummed in ackwnoledgement. It was harder to forget than remembering someone with such combination of face and awkward name.</p>\n<p>“Mister Monkey, I thought you’ll spend the ceremony to show Mister Snake around since he’s an outsider. What are you doing in Malikh Family?” Shira asked.</p>\n<p>“Now, now, please drop the ‘Mister’, young master. I’m not that old yet to be called as such,” Monkey said, then he continued explaining his story this evening. “We were planning to go to your family’s ceremony, young master. But who would have thought Snake to meet with his relatives here? His relatives are actually Malikh Family’s guests for tonight’s Ngajen Ceremony. Bet he got to eat expensive cuisines right now.”</p>\n<p>“Well, it’ll be easier with Mister Snake here. I’ve got some coins I want to show you, I wonder if it works to use them for--” Shira sneakily glanced at his cousin, then turned back to Monkey like it was nothing, “--for the thing we talked about yesterday.”</p>\n<p>Mila sneered, “You have some business to attend, no?”</p>\n<p>“Not really, no,” Shira shrugged off her question.</p>\n<p>“Really, though?” Mila crossed her arms, sneered again. “I think I saw Romana just now. I’mma chat with her a little bit.”</p>\n<p>It seemed to Shira that his cousin meeting with Romana here, in Malikh Family’s Ngajen Ceremony, wasn’t simply to have fun. He didn’t like his cousin would make trouble but he didn’t want to spend the whole night with her either. “Don’t go home without me,” he said eventually.</p>\n<p>“Hmph! You’re not a kid anymore but still need me to accompany you home?”</p>\n<p>No, Shira actually was more worried about her than himself.</p>\n<p>He then glanced beside and said, “Mister Monkey.”</p>\n<p>“Just Monkey,” Monkey corrected.</p>\n<p>“Mister Just Monkey, you said Mister Snake with relative? And his relatives are Malikh Family’s guests?”</p>\n<p>“Not Just Mon--ah, forget about it,” Monkey already gave up guessing whether Young Master Shira Yashura was purposely pulling his leg or not. “They really were Malikh Family’s guests, they even got the front row for the prayer and all.”</p>\n<p>“Is hard for us to be friendly if Mister Snake is involved with Malikh Family.”</p>\n<p>“You mean, that, huh? Well, I’ve been here for a while and they talked about you a lot, so I guess even someone as chill as you can get angry sometimes. But you don’t have to worry about those Malikhs, Young Master Shira. As long as their patriarch is Ghalim Malikh they won’t sever ties with Yashura so easily.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, is this your opinion?”</p>\n<p>“It’s Snake’s. It’s what he said before he met his relatives.”</p>\n<p>Shira thought the Alchemist he met once before was a total stranger of Badril Village, but it appeared he was wrong. “He really does know about Malikh Family that much, doesn’t he?”</p>\n<p>“Well, yeah, but I think he’s more familiar with Yashura than Malikh Family, though,” Monkey said, crossing his arms and nodded to himself as he recalled things that Snake told him to get his wares supported by Yashura Family; for example, obtaining Butler Yulong’s permission the same as Patriarch Shuro Yashura’s, Snake once said.</p>\n<p>“What? Why do you make that kind of face, Young Master Shira?” Monkey was snapped from his train of thought.</p>\n<p>“Ah, no, I just don’t expect you’re going to say some like that.”</p>\n<p>“What are you saying, young master. In the first place, Snake became my crew because he heard I’ve some dealing with Yashura Family.”</p>\n<p>Shira did recall the first time Monkey contacted Yashura Family--through him. To be more exact, the first item Monkey dealt from Malikh Family was Shira’s smuggled erotic painting that Good-Natured Spirit rejected.</p>\n<p>“--Speaking of Snake,” with his thumb Monkey did point in a certain direction. The place was separated from the common guest as they indeed were Malikh Family’s special guests. Shira’s eyes followed and he saw the familiar Alchemist he knew not long ago, Snake, was talking with two men, young and old, most likely brother and his grandfather.</p>\n<p>“Don’t be fooled by their appearances, young master. They’re renowned experts,” Monkey said.</p>\n<p>The pair of brother and grandfather wore worn out pale robes as their clothes, unlike the image of revered experts in Shira’s mind. Monkey told him both likely to travel incognito for various reasons. The old man had an old white hair and long beard, his back crooked and had to bring a walking staff to support himself, and gave people the impression of a sleepy grandpa from the dim light on his eyes. The young one though, had an always angry-looking face with fierce brows, crossing his muscle-thick arms, locked in a debate with Snake. Snake’s face was notably paler than when Shira met him in the market.</p>\n<p>“We can’t greet Mister Snake now, can we?” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think we can,” Monkey said. Even though he long considered Snake as his partner, the two guests appearing incognito were still the main members of the revered Alchemist family. This was no time for commoners like him acting friendly on them all of the sudden.</p>\n<p>The sleepy-looking old man, noticing two pairs of eyes looking at him, he raised his head. He caught the sight of Shira. Their eyes met.</p>\n<p>“Oh ho,” the old man smiled when he found the boy. He dragged his old body to approach the flastergabbed Shira and Monkey.</p>\n<p>Even Monkey who knew more about them wouldn’t expect Snake’s relatives to introduce themselves first.</p>\n<p>“He’s heading this way…”</p>\n<p>“Ah, yes, apparently.”</p>\n<p>Monkey gulped. “It’s different with Snake. Although he looked like that, whatever you do, please, young master, you can’t afford to be rude in front of this elder…”</p>\n<p>From the nervousness in Monkey’s voice Shira found the approaching old man seemed to hail from a more prestigious family than he originally thought.</p>\n<p>“Greeting, elder,” Shira said with his head humbly lowered as soon as he approached.</p>\n<p>The old man chuckled, patted Shira’s head, said, “Ah, Young Master, look how much you’ve grown. It feels like only yesterday how happy you were running around like a little kid you are.”</p>\n<p>Shira nodded hearing that. He glanced beside him, and caught Monkey’s face flabbergasted looking both at the boy and the old man.</p>\n<p>Hiding his embarrassment behind a fake cough, Shira then tried to understand whether the old man mistook him for someone else. “I’m sorry, elder. I don’t know if I’m mistaken, but, have we met before?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, have we met? Of course we’ve--” he stopped. The old man's eyes were covered by a pair of soft hands of a girl.</p>\n<p>“Guess who this is?” the girl who sneakily teased the old man from behind was grinning.</p>\n<p>“Oho! Who is this? Who is this?” the old man smiled delightedly.</p>\n<p>Both Shira and Monkey were tense watching the scene before them. Especially Shira Yashura, who knew that the grin on his cousin’s face always told that the girl enjoyed herself a little bit too much.</p>\n<p>“Isn’t this… Tomboy Princess?” the old man guessed.</p>\n<p>“Tuut! Wrong!”</p>\n<p>Mila released her hands. When the old man turned to see the preparator, he exclaimed with a chuckle.</p>\n<p>“It’s really you, Tomboy Princess.”</p>\n<p>Mila excitedly echoed, “It’s really you, Grandpa Piss!”</p>\n<p>They were so glad they met after a long time that they started to hug each other. Then Mila pull herself from the oldman’s embrace, yelling, “Ugghh…” she pinched her nose, “I smell something pissy around here.”</p>\n<p>Just when Shira and Monkey wondered what Mila meant by that, the girl looked at the old man, saying, “It’s no wonder it smells pissy. Have you taken a bath, Grandpa Piss.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss answered with a laugh. But Shira and Monkey facepalmed.</p>\n<p>So much for being mindful in front of the revered old expert.</p>\n<p>Shira awkwardly smiled to cover his shame. “Mila, you should be mindful in front of elders.”</p>\n<p>“Mindful?” Mila gasped. “In front of Grandpa Piss? Why?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, it’s okay, young master,” the old man said as he waved his hand. “I’m not that old to lose my sense of humor. Yashura Family’s princess sure is as naughty as always.” His wrinkles deepened as he curled his lips into a big smile. He said to Mila, “I reckon Patriarch Shuro’s been well, my princess? I recall he got a lot of migraines back in the day.”</p>\n<p>Haughtily, Mila replied, “Don’t worry about that guy, Grandpa Piss. His brain capacity has been declining these past years so there’s really nothing left inside to give him any headache!”</p>\n<p>“Ehem,” Shira cleared his phlegm. “She meant our patriarch has been well, elder.”</p>\n<p>“That’s what I said,” Mila laughed, and the old man laughed too. After that Mila kissed Grandpa Piss’s right hand as if she was kissing an elder’s hand from her own family, then continued laughing as cheeky as always.</p>\n<p>“My naughty princess,” Grandpa Piss ruffled Mila’s hair, “I planned to visit Yashura Family later. But since we’ve already met, here, please take this.”</p>\n<p>Receiving a pack wrapped in dried leaves, Mila pouted her lips. “You wouldn’t be lying about this being a candy again, would you?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, of course not.”</p>\n<p>As far as her memory served her well, what Grandpa Piss called candy actually a really bitter herb for young children to gain their appetite. Mila sniffed. She opened it and have a little taste. “Uuueeekk!”</p>\n<p>It was sour and even more bitter than she remembered. “What the hell is this?!”</p>\n<p>“That herb’s not for consumption, Young Lady Mila” the big man with muscles, Snake’s big brother, said from behind Grandpa Piss. He was smiling politely despite the other party merely a young lady of a rural village. “It’s a cosmetic for skin care.”</p>\n<p>“Skin care?!”</p>\n<p>Mila’s mouth widened agape. But soon as she glanced at the muscle man who was approaching her, she became wary, leaned to Grandpa Piss and whispered, “Grandpa Piss, who’s that?”</p>\n<p>With a patient smile replied, Grandpa Piss said, “He’s Snotty. Don’t you remember Snotty?”</p>\n<p>Mila was surprised. “Oooohh! Snotty! You’ve turned into a real man now I can’t even recognize you anymore!”</p>\n<p>“Haha… you’re surely jest young lady,” Snotty said.</p>\n<p>“No, really…” with fingers on her chin, eyes on muscles, Mila added, “you really transformed into something new, Snotty. I’m impressed. You were so skinny and really a snotty boy back then.”</p>\n<p>The man continued to laugh. The atmosphere was friendly and harmless. Yet Monkey, who had long heard Snotty’s real identity and preceding reputation from Snake’s mouth, began sweating profusely.</p>\n<p>Mila really loved gifted cosmetics and the like. After knowing how effective it was for her beauty, she shamelessly asked, “Can I ask for more, Grandpa Piss? I have a good friend who needs to be a beauty--as soon as possible!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, of course I have more--here, take this,” Grandpa Piss took out another one.</p>\n<p>“Waow!” Mila’s eyes sparkled in a weird glint. Shira, who saw that, knew his cousin’s greed began to surface; suddenly the unruly young lady acted as if she was a timid maiden. “Grandpa Piss… I think my other friend needs it too…” she asked sweetly.</p>\n<p>“Hohoh!” Grandpa Piss stroked his beard again. “Unfortunately, my princess, I’ve got only three pack and I planned to give the last one for Young Lady Malikh.”</p>\n<p>Hearing a certain short-haired girl being mentioned, the shy maiden’s face twisted in an ugly sour face, returned back to her original color. “Tch.”</p>\n<p>“Hey, don’t click your tongue in front of elders,” Shira warned her.</p>\n<p>“Tch.” Mila crossed her arms and threw away her pouting face.</p>\n<p>Shira was always frustrated whenever a younger one like him would be the one to reprimand ethics into this blockhead of a girl.</p>\n<p>“Now, now, young lady. Please remember Grandpa’s already too old to concoct too many cosmetics--getting two packs already good enough,” Snotty said.</p>\n<p>Snake looked at the leaves wrapped cosmetics in Mila’s hands and exclaimed, “Grandfather concocted them himself?”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss nodded with an amiable smile. “Of course. Been twelve years since the last time I was here. It’d be embarrassing if I came with half-hearted gifts, don’t you think so?”</p>\n<hr>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>The nickname of “Grandpa Piss” stuck on Grandmaster Alchemist’s name for twelve years. When a friend of his asked the origin of this horrible nickname, the Grandmaster laughed it off and said a princess of his old friend’s family started calling him that, because her cousin who was still a three years old brat urinated on him every time the Grandmaster tried to hug him.</p>\n<p>Legend said that the princess was also calling the heir of Grandmaster Alchemist’s family with the nickname of “Snotty”. But even to this day, nobody knows which kingdom this cheeky princess comes from.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n","volume-5/chapter-3":"<p>What the Nalaq told Shira lingered in his mind. Good-Natured Spirit blurted something about killing someone as if it was something trivial that could popped out easily in normal conversation. To kill someone after finding out his secret--what kind of secret he needed to protect anyway? A secret he never wanted people to know the fact he was drawing semi-porns for money. But he wasn’t that insecure to kill someone over a petty secret like that? That would be him being not right in the head. The more he thought about Good-Natured Spirit’s remark, the more it disturbed him. Especially right now, when his hands painted in red, bathed in blood. When he just did an act of actual killing.</p>\n<p>“Something on your mind, Young Master Shira?” a rough voice disturbed his train of thought.</p>\n<p>“Ah,” Shira looked at a burly man, an experienced hunter, who called him.</p>\n<p>The man’s body even drenched in thicker blood than him. One would get easily nauseated by the sight of it. Yet it didn’t make the boy flinched, as he was expecting the experience for a few months already.</p>\n<p>“Here. Look at his gut. Spilling out his innards with your own hands might be a good experience for you, young master.”</p>\n<p>The hunter spun a sharp dagger, holding it by the tip of its blade, having a gesture of offering it to his young master.</p>\n<p>“Is that okay? I even had trouble when skinning the hide,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>He’d rather not, to be honest, since splitting a goat’s gut could be messy if he did it crudely. Even if he was the young master of the family, when messing with the raw meat, not even his uncle could save him from the aunties’ nagging. Shira Yashura was nearly sixteen, almost reaching adulthood, so he had to participate in butchering goats; it was a quite tasking task, but was easy enough compared to butchering cows he had to do in a few years. But for the fifteen years old young master, getting the hang of the butchering knife’s handle was plenty of experience already for him.</p>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>As the custom dictates, every month in ngajen ceremony preparation, the boys will have to deal with cows and goats while the girls help aunties plucking chickens’ and ducks’ feathers. Whether the gatekeepers' children or the family’s next heirs, all of them are required to do it every time a major ceremony approaches.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>After doing his part in butchering a goat Shira immediately took a bath to remove the bloody pungent. On a whim he then strolled to the kitchen to grab some snacks. There he witnessed how all the coconuts he and his uncle shred already transformed into delicious foods; rendang, Bulayak satay, coconut satay, spicy curry, many other mouth drolling coconut cuisines. The coconut loving uncle was all smiles and gave him a big portion of the famous beef cuisine the locals called rendang--which, normally, even for a young master like Shira would get to eat rendang once every few months. But with enough wit and experience in currying favor with his uncle, he got to taste those delicious food handed down by his uncle, the Chief Chef, personally.</p>\n<p>“Shira my boy,” Patriarch Shuro said to his nephew who was squatting below the shadow of a thick pillar, happily munching on his rendang, “you’re going to visit Malikh Family tonight. Keep a good check on your cousin. Don’t embarrass Yashura Family and present our rendang_ _for their main family.”</p>\n<p>“Sure.”</p>\n<hr>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>Domesticated cows were less in numbers than goats in Badril Village, so meals from cows, not including the innards which could be made into popular but cheap cuisines, like only served for village big shots or important visitors during the ngajen ceremony.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>Laughters and chatters made the night more merry than any other thay of the month. It was brighter than usual, as villagers came out of their house to set up big braziers to light the road between the families that were holding festives. From one hundred meters away, through the thick wall of the big families, the mouth-watering aroma of prepared food wafted through the air as if they informally invited people to come and to taste the delicacy these big families had. The change in scenery upon the arrival of the night signaled the nigh of Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>Yashura Family, the oldest family around, was known to have the best food amongst all families in Badril Village, while Elzhier Family known as the family that always threw the biggest party post-ceremony--Elzhier Family’s maidservants were beautiful and they’d show off their voluptuous bodies every single ngajen ceremony. Particularly this month however, everyone was anticipating the ceremony thrown by Malikh Family; for two years since the young lady’s absence they threw nothing more than mediocre festivities, her return was to be seen as their revival on the village’s political stage. And from how big their arrangement looked like, it seemed Malikh Family didn’t plan to fail everyone’s expectations.</p>\n<p>Shira Yashura wore the same suit he got from his uncle on his fifteenth birthday. It was the usual suit he’d wear whenever a ceremony was held. His uncle bought it from a merchant who had connections outside the kingdom, which was pretty good since the fabric wasn’t stiff, but could get unbearably itchy in places he didn’t want to scratch whenever there were people around. The obvious part missing from the wears his peers were wearing was beast pelts.</p>\n<p>Pelts from ferocious beasts were known for irrefutable proof for boys’ courage and manliness. As many young gentlemen of Badril Village wore on their necks, always looking for the opportunity to show off the trophy of their preys to girls--which translated as fashionable fads for boys who wanted to get laids.</p>\n<p>Of course, Shira, as part of the dull and no-nonsense camp of the boys in Badril Village, never had participated in that kind of indecent business. He was so dull that the only girl who would accompany him to attend ceremonies was his cousin Mila--who, even though her face was quite pretty, also happened to be in terrible luck for romance.</p>\n<p>“No matter how many times I see it, it’s always impressive to see how fast you wrap all these banana leaves,” Shira commented as he watched how Mila wrapped rendang with banana leaves. She was very good at it, comparable to the aunties’ skills that had been forged day and night in the family’s kitchen.</p>\n<p>“You talking? You’ve done your training with the family's sword technique, I assume?” Mila said with her lips pouted. Shira thought it was unusual for Mila didn’t nag her mouth off immediately when she saw him. He saw a sword wrapped in cloth near Mila. His face immediately twisted in a troubled look.</p>\n<p>“I won’t bring that thing,” he protested.</p>\n<p>“You--” Mila hissed.</p>\n<p>“What should I do with a sword inside another family’s ceremony?” Shira said. The sword was his father’s, and that was his reason he didn’t want to use it. “Look, I can only draw the blade from the sheath at most. Without a proper amount of Strength attribute I can’t swing this properly. It rejects my mana. I’d make a fool out of myself if that happened.”</p>\n<p>“That’s because you were stupidly increasing your Wisdom instead of, that’s why you--arghh! Just forget about it! I know you’re trying to make excuses! Since you’re so weak all we can do is flaunting around your father’s reputation. We’ve got to remind people that our Yashura Family’s not to mess with. Here, just slip this fucking sword in your belt.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, this is embarrassing. Those rumors are about to get worse tonight,” Shira said with a sigh. His reputation as a trash talent was annoying enough, added this shameless act of throwing his weight around, he’d become more reluctant to show his face in the public later on. But still he unwillingly slipped the sword in his belt.</p>\n<p>Mila snorted. She ignored the complaint. Right now she could care less about the rumors about her cousin. What she had to prioritize tonight was the bad premonition she had about Bhela Malikh’s short hair--nobody believed her when she said that Bhela was being a slut for cutting her hair short in spite of her being in an engagement. While her hands craftly knotted the rendang wrapped in banana leaves with a rope made with dried coconut leaves, she suddenly had a cold smile; the image of those impudent Malikhs shuddering under the famous sword of Yashura Family’s Unique Class, Jhuro Yashura the Blackfang Swordsman, entertained her she began to chuckle coldly.</p>\n<p>“Huhuhu… just you wait you bitch…”</p>\n<p>Shira stepped back. He had the hunch he should keep a distance away from his current cousin right now.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Every month, for every family in Badril Village, cooking during the Ngajen Ceremony was always a time rushing hectic. Even more in Malikh Family this time. Since the amount of food they had to deliver before the ceremony started more than twice the amount they made last month, most of the aunties in duty were cooking outdoors. The smoke from the half-dried firewood would be too unbearable for the eyes if all of them cooked in one cramped place. Fortunately, most of the dishes were already cooked and sent to the courtyard, so the only people who were still on duty preparing food were a small number of aunties and maidservants.</p>\n<p>The young maidservants were pale from tiredness but they couldn’t afford to slack in this one Ngajen Ceremony. The usual noisy aunties, they didn’t even show a sign of wanting to rest. Nobody could beat the resilience of the kitchen-duty armies when it came to preparing for a loadful of party’s foods.</p>\n<p>Usually, the one who would supervise these spartan cooking aunties would be the patriarch’s wife, Bhela’s mother. It was already a long-held tradition in the village for the patriarch to cook for the family’s important guests as the Chief Chef, while the wife supported him by supervising the aunties and maidservants. In Ngajen Ceremony this month, however, Bhela’s mother holed herself to accompany the husband on his ill-bed.</p>\n<p>She was not in the mood to meet with people. So Bhela stepped in to fill her position.</p>\n<p>Back when she was little Bhela often followed her mother working during the ngajen ceremony, she knew what she had to do by the back of her hand. In usage of salt, for example, she knew down to the tiniest detail of how much salt should be applied to different kinds of cuisines. She also instructed the inexperienced maidservants who were in charge of cooking side dishes so the overall quality of the feast would be balanced. Bhela Malikh didn’t betray everyone’s expectations about her. She did her work splendidly.</p>\n<p>However, there was a matter she saw that didn’t make her happy. The largest furnace that was usually reserved for the Chief Chef, today was used by an old man from the outer family. A great cook, the old man was. Known for his vast experience in handling the family’s food stalls for years. The problem was his common status. Without at least an elder status made it awkward for him to cook as the Chief Chef in this kitchen, even if he was a mere proxy. Bhela wondered whether the one who took the charge when her parents were unavailable knew the risk of being laughed at and criticized by the other two big families--especially now that the relationship between Yashura and Malikh wasn’t that good like before.</p>\n<p>“Young lady, the day’s getting dark, you should take a bath now and prepare yourself for the ceremony,” an aunty said to Bhela.</p>\n<p>“Yes, young lady is no longer a little girl, so making you pretty will take a while,” an early twenty maidservant added from the side. She continued, “The new girls should be able to complete the foods since you directed them a lot. Please don’t worry about us.”</p>\n<p>“I’m relieved to hear that,” Bhela said. Not yet three seconds later her eyes wandered to the old cook again. She couldn’t hide her frown.</p>\n<p>“Something the matter, Young Lady Bhela?”</p>\n<p>“Yes. Maybe it’s a misunderstanding on my part but… I can’t see the elder who would substitute my father as the Chief Chef.”</p>\n<p>Hearing Bhela said her concern, the aunties and the maidservants averted eyes with their young lady with troubled faces. Bhela then understood there was something shady going on.</p>\n<p>Her suspicion turned worse when she saw a young man in his twenties leading four manservants with him. When the aunties were working in the kitchen, it was an unspoken rule for unrelated adult men not to approach, but the battle-hardened aunties that normally were ferocious in defending their territories were all silent in welcoming the cocky visitors. It wasn’t surprising to Bhela that all of them came from Elder Jhamil’s faction.</p>\n<p>“Why aren’t you ready yet, old worm?!”</p>\n<p>“I am sorry, young elder… some dish cannot be rushed so I prepared some to--”</p>\n<p><em>Slap!!</em></p>\n<p>The slapping sound echoed in the kitchen. The room descended into a dead silent. The old cook was trembling; he lowered his head and covered the cheek that just got slapped but everyone could see the blood on the corner of his mouth. Bhela recollected her memory, and finally remembered the arrogant young man was actually Elder Jhamil’s own son.</p>\n<p>“Shit!” Elder Jhamil’s son swore, “those councils from Village Hall came. We must complete the set before too long! Those people are the ones who usually have the heaviest voice when valuing Ngajen Ceremony dishes!”</p>\n<p>One follower quipped, “Young elder is right. This old worm can’t cook shit! If this goes on, the only things the Village Hall council will remember about Elder Jhamil’s cooking is that we Malikhs cook as slow as snail!”</p>\n<p>The frown on Bhela’s face became deeper. Young elder? Before she went out for the seminars that lasted two years, this man, son of Elder Jhamil, merely a family member with a post within the family’s business. And something else that disturbed her was how she couldn’t see how the blurted about Elder Jhamil’s cooking, the one who worked in the kitchen all day, didn’t see the said elder even once today.</p>\n<p>Bhela still held her silent. But her eyes were cold and sharp judging people and the situation. The aunties and the maidservants, though they looked sympathetic with the old man, were afraid to go against Elder Jhamil’s son. Maybe because the lack of resistance Elder Jhamil’s son dared to do a taboo known in the kitchen--swapping food that wrapped in banana leaves with ceramic plates, garnished a bit, and called it the Chief Chef’s cuisine.</p>\n<p>“No, young elder!” a brave middle-aged aunty stepped forward, “you can’t do that!”</p>\n<p>“Why not?” one follower sneered in Elder Jhamil’s son’s place. “This one also got beef, isn’t it? We need to quickly serve the Chief Chef cuisine to the people from Village Hall councils.”</p>\n<p>“Exactly because they are from the Village Hall council--just from inferior cuts of the beef they’d know the dishes have been swapped! You’ll tarnish Malikh Family’s honor if people knew you were fooling--”</p>\n<p>“Fooling?!” Elder Jhamil roared.</p>\n<p>The young elder raised his hand, though the aunty who complained quickly hid back behind the maidservants. Elder Jhamil’s son then rampaged into a series of barking, yelling and threatening the aunties to cut their salary just because his mood was spoiled.</p>\n<p>His words scared all the girls and the women inside the kitchen. All except Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>After they were done swapping the foods, the young elder led his men out of the kitchen with great swagger. The young elder stopped at the door, turned around, and gave the old cook one last ultimatum: “There’ll be a noble in the ceremony so we need rendang for the main course. So go make it, old worm. You know what’s gonna happen if you couldn’t deliver, don’t you?”</p>\n<p>The old man trembled. Even the eyes on the aunties couldn’t help but shake at the threat. There was now way they could prepare rendang with only two hours remaining until the Ngajen Ceremony started.</p>\n<p>After that situation calmed down. The aunties and the maidservants went back to work. Some of them still exchanged whispered and gossiped amongst themselves. But when Bhela approached, immediately they stopped and pretended nothing happened.</p>\n<p>“Young lady…” a pudgy aunty came to her, the one who stood up against the young elder from before.</p>\n<p>“Aunty?”</p>\n<p>“We are sorry… we’ve had no meaning to show you that embarrassing scene.”</p>\n<p>Bhela shook her head. “No, I’m one from the main family bloodline; I should've been the one who stood up to him instead of hiding behind everyone.”</p>\n<p>The aunty knew the young lady didn’t say a word before because the girl wanted to know the situation. Some other middle-aged aunties who were close with Madam Malikh also knew more or less Bhela’s detached wait-and-see attitude, so no one really would blame her even if she didn’t say a word before--especially since she had just returned from overseas. The pudgy aunty tugged on Bhela’s sleeve, whispered to her ear, “Young Lady Bhela, we know you’re concerned. But we’ve already gotten used to it. You’re still young. Your future is brighter than everyone else in the family, Young Lady Bhela. It’s better to endure than pointlessly making enemies.”</p>\n<p>“This isn’t pointless,” Bhela said. She then grabbed the nearest apron and wore it. Her father was the patriarch. And she wasn’t a poster girl to draw everyone’s attention to the family.</p>\n<p>The pudgy aunty wanted to say something again. But words stuck on her throat, she closed her mouth as soon as she opened it.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the old man began to pick some mature coconut and shredded it listlessly. He got more than four decades of handling food stalls for Malikh Family, he wasn’t a stranger at cooking rendang. But he already gave up on finishing one for tonight’s Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>“Uncle, I’ll take it from here,” Bhela said as she approached the weary old man.</p>\n<p>“Ahh, yes?” the old man was started. The girl came with an apron and common garment, had fair and beautiful skin, as well clear and articulate voice; a maidservant from the inner family was the first one that came to his mind. But only when he noticed even the aunties were respectful to her and her striking bob-cut short hair that the old man began drenched in cold sweat.</p>\n<p>“I said, uncle,” Bhela repeated, “I’ll take it from here. You can rest now.”</p>\n<p>The old man vigorously shook his head.</p>\n<p>“Please Young Lady Bhela… please spare this old bone….”</p>\n<p>“This is originally my father’s post, uncle. You’ll have to be at least an elder and write your name in council’s ledger to be a substitute for my father.”</p>\n<p>The old man wanted to break into a tearless cry. This is worse than when he faced Elder Jhamil’s son's harassment before. The most thing he was afraid of was the news of Elder Jhamil using him as Chief Chef behind the scene to reach the ears of the main family. And now that Bhela Malikh was here, there was nothing he could do but to resign his life to fate.</p>\n<p>“Y-young lady!” a maidservant yelled, “you can’t!”</p>\n<p>“Who says I can’t?” Bhela asked sharply.</p>\n<p>An aunty, who had a stern-looking face, said, “You can’t cook for the main course, young lady. In case of a patriarch's absence, usually one of the elders who’s going to take his place. There’s no rule saying it’s okay for women to do it.”</p>\n<p>“Then, I’m going to ask,” from the aunty, Bhela threw her glance toward the old man, “are you an elder cooking here to substitute my father as a cook, uncle?”</p>\n<p>The old man’s face turned pale. Whichever the answer of that question would lead him to the road of punishment. All of the sudden, he became a mute.</p>\n<p>Because she had the most standing, nobody made a sound when Young Lady Bhela Malikh asked them to fetch chickens and spices for her.</p>\n<p>Not long after, the story about how the Young Lady of Malikh Family wanted to substitute her father spread like a wildfire. Never in Badril Village’s history would a young lady do that. A crowd of curious males, mostly the youngsters from main and outer of Malikh Family, surrounded the kitchen as they wanted to catch a glimpse of how their beautiful young lady recklessly challenged the custom by her own. The boys sighed in admiration. Bhela Malikh was essentially an Archer at heart. But the way she handled a blade, even if it was a kitchen knife, was skillful and graceful, as every time her slim wrist stopped moving from cutting down a vegetable, a wave of gulping could be heard. The boys couldn’t take their eyes from her. The reckless and brave young lady was simply too charming.</p>\n<p>“Did you know that foreigners often confuse rendang as dried curry?” Bhela said to one maidservant who stared at the way she cooked. “Curry leaves originated from an area close to western Haldeen lands, so many local Mossacks sailed the sea to try their luck making it big working for western empires.”</p>\n<p>The usual aloof Bhela unusually was talkative when she was cooking, which was quite a big surprise for people who were watching. She explained to the clueless maidservants how, during her two years travelling in seminars from countries to countries, found many noble owned restaurants claimed to serve rendang but turned out to be dried curry. All the while sharply focused on doing her cooking duty.</p>\n<p>“Young lady!” from the crowd came out an angry bald man. He was Elder Jhamil. “W-what are you doing there?”</p>\n<p>“I’m cooking,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“But you can’t work there!” Elder Jhamil yelled. “No woman can substitute for patriarch! That’s against the rule!”</p>\n<p>“I don’t recall we have a rule like that.”</p>\n<p>“If you know why you still stand there?”</p>\n<p>“Neither do I recall a rule for an elder to use a stand-in for the Chief Chef position.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s face turned weird as if he suddenly got constipated. Many of the youngsters didn’t catch Bhela’s remarks nor they cared too much about it, but some in the crowd were nodding knowingly, as many of them were familiar with how shady Elder Jhamil was doing things.</p>\n<p>As the bald elder’s head was racing fast looking for an answer to defuse the young lady’s claim, suddenly, a loud roar exploded behind him.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela, who do you think you are? Just because your father is the family’s patriarch you think you can do whatever you want?!”</p>\n<p>The faces of aunties and the maidservants twitched. They witnessed how the young elder harassed the old man before, so they were itching to throw back the same question at him instead, though no more brave aunties dared to cause more troubles.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s son continued, “The ingredient for making Chief dishes takes money, young lady. Not even the patriarch himself has the daring to use coins from the treasury for himself. Do you want to embarrass your parents that much?”</p>\n<p>“I’m not making this food for myself nor I cook for my father. It’s for the guests. And I provided the spices and the foreign curry leaves by myself,” Bhela said. Some maidservants behind her nodded nervously as Bhela indeed ordered them to fetch spices from the personal kitchen in the main family’s residential area.</p>\n<p>In spite of that, the young elder kept pushing on with nasty smile on his face.</p>\n<p>“What about the chicken, young lady? They cost money! What do you say about that, huh?”</p>\n<p>Behind Bhela, the aunties, even the maidservants, were whispering at each other on how ridiculous it was to question the sole young generation of Malikh Family main bloodline over some chickens. Even Bhela, the young lady in question, would only glanced at the troubled expression of Elder Jhamil.</p>\n<p>“I will pay for the chicken,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Ha? Pay? With what? Your father’s money? Can’t a sick person even pay the cost of the foods for ngajen ceremony all by himself?”</p>\n<p>“No need to bring my father’s name here.” Bhela said with a dangerously cold tone.</p>\n<p>The chillness in her eyes was telling that she really did hate people bringing her parents’ name in bad faith. After hearing gasps of surprise from people that didn’t expect the usually silent young lady could utter something with such a biting tone, she sighed, said with an explanation, “I got a dress as a gift from a certain person who has too much money in his pocket. He said the dress is so valuable even the princesses wear them in parties. It should cover the cost of these chickens I’m going to cook if I sell the dress right here right now.”</p>\n<p>Bhela then tilted her head and glanced at the bald elder.</p>\n<p>“Am I right, Elder Jhamil?”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil wanted to maintain his smile, but his face went stiff as stone. He was trembling inside for knowing that the dress he acquired with a large sum of money and with his best connection, valued the same as some mere village chickens in Bhela’s eyes.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, his son, who was taken aback for a bit from the cold remark Bhela had said earlier, recovered, began to yell again, “Ha! Did you not train your brain when you were overseas, my young lady? The same dress princesses wear in parties? Only someone dumb believe that! Hah! Obviously you’ve been lied to! You’ve been crooked, young lady, crooked--”</p>\n<p><em>Paak!</em></p>\n<p>From behind, the already red-faced Elder Jhamil smacked his son’s head. “You’ve been rude to Young Lady Bhela, you dumbskull! You have to apologize! Young lady can’t bear to hear it anymore!”</p>\n<p>While in fact it was him who couldn’t bear to hear being called a crook.</p>\n<p>“Apologize!” Elder Jhamil roared.</p>\n<p><em>Splash!</em></p>\n<p>The pair father and son’s performance didn’t amuse Bhela, however. With the lid in her hand, Bhela scooped boiling curry broth and splashed it to their direction. Surprised, the stupid young elder swore with nasty words while his father cried in high-pitched voice.</p>\n<p>“Please get out,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil laughed wryly.</p>\n<p>“Please don’t be like that, young lady. I know my son doesn't have the best education but--”</p>\n<p><em>Splash!!</em></p>\n<p>Bhela waved the cooking lid once again as soon as Elder Jhamil stepped forward. The hot water splashed on his expensive boots. This time, while he didn’t expect for Bhela splashing hot water at him again, he wasn’t freaking out. It seemed his plan to make the young lady behave a little backfiring instead. His face turned solemn.</p>\n<p>“Young lady…”</p>\n<p>“I’m not going to say it thrice--everyone who has nothing to do in the kitchen, please get out,” Bhela said. “Or else--”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The major families’ lands were astonishingly spacious and complex, their walls were thick and tall, therefore each of them employed a few stationary guards for the main gate as gatekeepers. These gatekeepers, though usually filled by members of the outer part of the families, their duty were significantly more important than others since they represented the face of the family they served. So they always maintain polite gestures to everyone who came through their gate, either commoners or rich people from big families. Yet when Shira and Mila arrived the Malikh Family’s gatekeepers didn’t even hide their scoffs.</p>\n<p>“Ridiculous!” she hissed with a face boiled in anger, “even lowly gatekeepers are looking down on us!”</p>\n<p>“Don’t bother with them,” Shira said. Unlike his cousin’s furious temper, his flair seemed like he shrugged the blatant disrespect, as the holder of “Eternal Novice” title he was already numb by how people were talking behind his back.</p>\n<p>“If your father was here they’d bow their asses as soon as they saw us Yashura coming.”</p>\n<p>Shira shrugged his shoulders again.</p>\n<p>Still seething in anger, Mila cast her eyes on the banana leaves wrapped food in Shira’s hands. “Who should we give the rendang to?” she asked.</p>\n<p>“Let’s just give it to a random servant.” Then Shira called a maidservant who was carrying a tray full of food. “Excuse me!”</p>\n<p>“Yes? What can I help y--” The moment this maidservant turned her head and saw Shira’s face, she immediately threw back her eyes and escaped with hurried trot, pretending she saw nothing.</p>\n<p>“The fuck?!” Mila was flastergabbed, didn’t know what to say.</p>\n<p>Later on Shira and Mila realized how unpopular Yashura Family was to the current Malikhs, even the servants who usually held no voice in the family were avoiding the pair of cousins like plague. Their attitude especially worsened when it came to Shira Yashura.</p>\n<p>“Look there,” someone whispered amongst the guests, “Yashura Family send their eldest young miss and the young master! Out of all the Ngajen Ceremony, they choose tonight to show their faces--pretty obvious, eh? Bet they’re drooling to get another Unique Class after knowing our Young Lady Bhela’s real talent tonight!”</p>\n<p>Someone else agreed and replied, “With that kind of trash as their young master, they’d be dreamin’ to get even a touch of our Young Lady Bhela. Pueh!”</p>\n<p>Hearing the muffled disdain, Mila Yashura whirled her body, glaring people with eagle eyes. “Who said that?!” she growled.</p>\n<p>“Mila…” Shira held her shoulder.</p>\n<p>“The fuckers don’t even put our Yashura Family in their eyes. Just because shitty rumors about Unique Class they started to feel high and mighty, eh?”</p>\n<p>“Just let go, Uncle Shuro didn’t send us here to start troubles,” Shira said. “All we need to do is to show our faces here and give them our rendang. It’s not our problem whether they welcome our good intention with grace or not.”</p>\n<p>Though Shira said that, he secretly hoped Malikh Family would grow too proud to receive it--all so he had an excuse to keep his uncle’s rendang for himself.</p>\n<p>A commotion arose. People hussing here and there with excitement. When Shira and Mila wanted to know what was going on, a parade of beautiful young women glittering and stealing the whole show came from inside of Malikh Family’s hall. Leading them was a short-haired young beauty, face as icy as an ice sculpture, the recent name that everyone had been talking about these days, Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>It was clear from the way Bhela positioned herself she represented the family as the ceremony’s Chief Chef.</p>\n<p>“Whoa, so Malikh Family let her do that,” Shira murmured.</p>\n<p>Not to mention being the Chief Chef--the most Shira did in his family’s kitchen was helping his uncle, helping him shred coconuts. They were at the same age, but the same old Shira still practiced butchering goats while the supposed fiancée of his was climbing the social ladder. Even Mila was angry by the special treatment Malikh Family gave to their young lady.</p>\n<p>“Sup, young master!” from behind a voice called him.</p>\n<p>Shira turned around, found the one who greeted him was Monkey.</p>\n<p>“Who?” Mila asked Shira as the stranger with a monkey-like face approaching.</p>\n<p>“This one is called by the name of Monkey, young lady,” Monkey, with his self-trained Mossack’s style bowing gesture, introduced himself smoothly.</p>\n<p>Mila hummed in ackwnoledgement. It was harder to forget than remembering someone with such combination of face and awkward name.</p>\n<p>“Mister Monkey, I thought you’ll spend the ceremony to show Mister Snake around since he’s an outsider. What are you doing in Malikh Family?” Shira asked.</p>\n<p>“Now, now, please drop the ‘Mister’, young master. I’m not that old yet to be called as such,” Monkey said, then he continued explaining his story this evening. “We were planning to go to your family’s ceremony, young master. But who would have thought Snake to meet with his relatives here? His relatives are actually Malikh Family’s guests for tonight’s Ngajen Ceremony. Bet he got to eat expensive cuisines right now.”</p>\n<p>“Well, it’ll be easier with Mister Snake here. I’ve got some coins I want to show you, I wonder if it works to use them for--” Shira sneakily glanced at his cousin, then turned back to Monkey like it was nothing, “--for the thing we talked about yesterday.”</p>\n<p>Mila sneered, “You have some business to attend, no?”</p>\n<p>“Not really, no,” Shira shrugged off her question.</p>\n<p>“Really, though?” Mila crossed her arms, sneered again. “I think I saw Romana just now. I’mma chat with her a little bit.”</p>\n<p>It seemed to Shira that his cousin meeting with Romana here, in Malikh Family’s Ngajen Ceremony, wasn’t simply to have fun. He didn’t like his cousin would make trouble but he didn’t want to spend the whole night with her either. “Don’t go home without me,” he said eventually.</p>\n<p>“Hmph! You’re not a kid anymore but still need me to accompany you home?”</p>\n<p>No, Shira actually was more worried about her than himself.</p>\n<p>He then glanced beside and said, “Mister Monkey.”</p>\n<p>“Just Monkey,” Monkey corrected.</p>\n<p>“Mister Just Monkey, you said Mister Snake with relative? And his relatives are Malikh Family’s guests?”</p>\n<p>“Not Just Mon--ah, forget about it,” Monkey already gave up guessing whether Young Master Shira Yashura was purposely pulling his leg or not. “They really were Malikh Family’s guests, they even got the front row for the prayer and all.”</p>\n<p>“Is hard for us to be friendly if Mister Snake is involved with Malikh Family.”</p>\n<p>“You mean, that, huh? Well, I’ve been here for a while and they talked about you a lot, so I guess even someone as chill as you can get angry sometimes. But you don’t have to worry about those Malikhs, Young Master Shira. As long as their patriarch is Ghalim Malikh they won’t sever ties with Yashura so easily.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, is this your opinion?”</p>\n<p>“It’s Snake’s. It’s what he said before he met his relatives.”</p>\n<p>Shira thought the Alchemist he met once before was a total stranger of Badril Village, but it appeared he was wrong. “He really does know about Malikh Family that much, doesn’t he?”</p>\n<p>“Well, yeah, but I think he’s more familiar with Yashura than Malikh Family, though,” Monkey said, crossing his arms and nodded to himself as he recalled things that Snake told him to get his wares supported by Yashura Family; for example, obtaining Butler Yulong’s permission the same as Patriarch Shuro Yashura’s, Snake once said.</p>\n<p>“What? Why do you make that kind of face, Young Master Shira?” Monkey was snapped from his train of thought.</p>\n<p>“Ah, no, I just don’t expect you’re going to say some like that.”</p>\n<p>“What are you saying, young master. In the first place, Snake became my crew because he heard I’ve some dealing with Yashura Family.”</p>\n<p>Shira did recall the first time Monkey contacted Yashura Family--through him. To be more exact, the first item Monkey dealt from Malikh Family was Shira’s smuggled erotic painting that Good-Natured Spirit rejected.</p>\n<p>“--Speaking of Snake,” with his thumb Monkey did point in a certain direction. The place was separated from the common guest as they indeed were Malikh Family’s special guests. Shira’s eyes followed and he saw the familiar Alchemist he knew not long ago, Snake, was talking with two men, young and old, most likely brother and his grandfather.</p>\n<p>“Don’t be fooled by their appearances, young master. They’re renowned experts,” Monkey said.</p>\n<p>The pair of brother and grandfather wore worn out pale robes as their clothes, unlike the image of revered experts in Shira’s mind. Monkey told him both likely to travel incognito for various reasons. The old man had an old white hair and long beard, his back crooked and had to bring a walking staff to support himself, and gave people the impression of a sleepy grandpa from the dim light on his eyes. The young one though, had an always angry-looking face with fierce brows, crossing his muscle-thick arms, locked in a debate with Snake. Snake’s face was notably paler than when Shira met him in the market.</p>\n<p>“We can’t greet Mister Snake now, can we?” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think we can,” Monkey said. Even though he long considered Snake as his partner, the two guests appearing incognito were still the main members of the revered Alchemist family. This was no time for commoners like him acting friendly on them all of the sudden.</p>\n<p>The sleepy-looking old man, noticing two pairs of eyes looking at him, he raised his head. He caught the sight of Shira. Their eyes met.</p>\n<p>“Oh ho,” the old man smiled when he found the boy. He dragged his old body to approach the flastergabbed Shira and Monkey.</p>\n<p>Even Monkey who knew more about them wouldn’t expect Snake’s relatives to introduce themselves first.</p>\n<p>“He’s heading this way…”</p>\n<p>“Ah, yes, apparently.”</p>\n<p>Monkey gulped. “It’s different with Snake. Although he looked like that, whatever you do, please, young master, you can’t afford to be rude in front of this elder…”</p>\n<p>From the nervousness in Monkey’s voice Shira found the approaching old man seemed to hail from a more prestigious family than he originally thought.</p>\n<p>“Greeting, elder,” Shira said with his head humbly lowered as soon as he approached.</p>\n<p>The old man chuckled, patted Shira’s head, said, “Ah, Young Master, look how much you’ve grown. It feels like only yesterday how happy you were running around like a little kid you are.”</p>\n<p>Shira nodded hearing that. He glanced beside him, and caught Monkey’s face flabbergasted looking both at the boy and the old man.</p>\n<p>Hiding his embarrassment behind a fake cough, Shira then tried to understand whether the old man mistook him for someone else. “I’m sorry, elder. I don’t know if I’m mistaken, but, have we met before?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, have we met? Of course we’ve--” he stopped. The old man's eyes were covered by a pair of soft hands of a girl.</p>\n<p>“Guess who this is?” the girl who sneakily teased the old man from behind was grinning.</p>\n<p>“Oho! Who is this? Who is this?” the old man smiled delightedly.</p>\n<p>Both Shira and Monkey were tense watching the scene before them. Especially Shira Yashura, who knew that the grin on his cousin’s face always told that the girl enjoyed herself a little bit too much.</p>\n<p>“Isn’t this… Tomboy Princess?” the old man guessed.</p>\n<p>“Tuut! Wrong!”</p>\n<p>Mila released her hands. When the old man turned to see the preparator, he exclaimed with a chuckle.</p>\n<p>“It’s really you, Tomboy Princess.”</p>\n<p>Mila excitedly echoed, “It’s really you, Grandpa Piss!”</p>\n<p>They were so glad they met after a long time that they started to hug each other. Then Mila pull herself from the oldman’s embrace, yelling, “Ugghh…” she pinched her nose, “I smell something pissy around here.”</p>\n<p>Just when Shira and Monkey wondered what Mila meant by that, the girl looked at the old man, saying, “It’s no wonder it smells pissy. Have you taken a bath, Grandpa Piss.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss answered with a laugh. But Shira and Monkey facepalmed.</p>\n<p>So much for being mindful in front of the revered old expert.</p>\n<p>Shira awkwardly smiled to cover his shame. “Mila, you should be mindful in front of elders.”</p>\n<p>“Mindful?” Mila gasped. “In front of Grandpa Piss? Why?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, it’s okay, young master,” the old man said as he waved his hand. “I’m not that old to lose my sense of humor. Yashura Family’s princess sure is as naughty as always.” His wrinkles deepened as he curled his lips into a big smile. He said to Mila, “I reckon Patriarch Shuro’s been well, my princess? I recall he got a lot of migraines back in the day.”</p>\n<p>Haughtily, Mila replied, “Don’t worry about that guy, Grandpa Piss. His brain capacity has been declining these past years so there’s really nothing left inside to give him any headache!”</p>\n<p>“Ehem,” Shira cleared his phlegm. “She meant our patriarch has been well, elder.”</p>\n<p>“That’s what I said,” Mila laughed, and the old man laughed too. After that Mila kissed Grandpa Piss’s right hand as if she was kissing an elder’s hand from her own family, then continued laughing as cheeky as always.</p>\n<p>“My naughty princess,” Grandpa Piss ruffled Mila’s hair, “I planned to visit Yashura Family later. But since we’ve already met, here, please take this.”</p>\n<p>Receiving a pack wrapped in dried leaves, Mila pouted her lips. “You wouldn’t be lying about this being a candy again, would you?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, of course not.”</p>\n<p>As far as her memory served her well, what Grandpa Piss called candy actually a really bitter herb for young children to gain their appetite. Mila sniffed. She opened it and have a little taste. “Uuueeekk!”</p>\n<p>It was sour and even more bitter than she remembered. “What the hell is this?!”</p>\n<p>“That herb’s not for consumption, Young Lady Mila” the big man with muscles, Snake’s big brother, said from behind Grandpa Piss. He was smiling politely despite the other party merely a young lady of a rural village. “It’s a cosmetic for skin care.”</p>\n<p>“Skin care?!”</p>\n<p>Mila’s mouth widened agape. But soon as she glanced at the muscle man who was approaching her, she became wary, leaned to Grandpa Piss and whispered, “Grandpa Piss, who’s that?”</p>\n<p>With a patient smile replied, Grandpa Piss said, “He’s Snotty. Don’t you remember Snotty?”</p>\n<p>Mila was surprised. “Oooohh! Snotty! You’ve turned into a real man now I can’t even recognize you anymore!”</p>\n<p>“Haha… you’re surely jest young lady,” Snotty said.</p>\n<p>“No, really…” with fingers on her chin, eyes on muscles, Mila added, “you really transformed into something new, Snotty. I’m impressed. You were so skinny and really a snotty boy back then.”</p>\n<p>The man continued to laugh. The atmosphere was friendly and harmless. Yet Monkey, who had long heard Snotty’s real identity and preceding reputation from Snake’s mouth, began sweating profusely.</p>\n<p>Mila really loved gifted cosmetics and the like. After knowing how effective it was for her beauty, she shamelessly asked, “Can I ask for more, Grandpa Piss? I have a good friend who needs to be a beauty--as soon as possible!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, of course I have more--here, take this,” Grandpa Piss took out another one.</p>\n<p>“Waow!” Mila’s eyes sparkled in a weird glint. Shira, who saw that, knew his cousin’s greed began to surface; suddenly the unruly young lady acted as if she was a timid maiden. “Grandpa Piss… I think my other friend needs it too…” she asked sweetly.</p>\n<p>“Hohoh!” Grandpa Piss stroked his beard again. “Unfortunately, my princess, I’ve got only three pack and I planned to give the last one for Young Lady Malikh.”</p>\n<p>Hearing a certain short-haired girl being mentioned, the shy maiden’s face twisted in an ugly sour face, returned back to her original color. “Tch.”</p>\n<p>“Hey, don’t click your tongue in front of elders,” Shira warned her.</p>\n<p>“Tch.” Mila crossed her arms and threw away her pouting face.</p>\n<p>Shira was always frustrated whenever a younger one like him would be the one to reprimand ethics into this blockhead of a girl.</p>\n<p>“Now, now, young lady. Please remember Grandpa’s already too old to concoct too many cosmetics--getting two packs already good enough,” Snotty said.</p>\n<p>Snake looked at the leaves wrapped cosmetics in Mila’s hands and exclaimed, “Grandfather concocted them himself?”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss nodded with an amiable smile. “Of course. Been twelve years since the last time I was here. It’d be embarrassing if I came with half-hearted gifts, don’t you think so?”</p>\n<hr>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>The nickname of “Grandpa Piss” stuck on Grandmaster Alchemist’s name for twelve years. When a friend of his asked the origin of this horrible nickname, the Grandmaster laughed it off and said a princess of his old friend’s family started calling him that, because her cousin who was still a three years old brat urinated on him every time the Grandmaster tried to hug him.</p>\n<p>Legend said that the princess was also calling the heir of Grandmaster Alchemist’s family with the nickname of “Snotty”. But even to this day, nobody knows which kingdom this cheeky princess comes from.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n","volume-5/chapter-4-5":"<p>Badril Village, though had been two years passed without her presence, was the same as always for Bhela Malikh. She hadn’t that many acquaintances her age she could consider friendly before. In spite of that, from the day she returned, people act as if they were her rekindled childhood friends she never knew she had.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” a daughter of an elder from Elzhier Family asked curiously, “is the rumor about that story true?”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at her with eyelids half-closed.</p>\n<p>“Which rumor?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, silly you, of course <em>that</em> rumor! The one about your romance with a blue blood noble!”</p>\n<p>Giggles of girls followed after the girl’s words. When Bhela returned to Badril Village she brought not only fame and reputation, but interesting stories and rumors as well. She was currently surrounded by curious young ladies who sought for exciting gossip.</p>\n<p>“Yeah, yeah!” another girl excitedly hussing in low voice. “I heard he’ll attend Malikh’s ngajen ceremony tonight!”</p>\n<p>“Really?”</p>\n<p>“Why else would Young Lady Bhela take the Chef Chief position if she didn’t expect for her lover to come tonight? He’ll come for sure!”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, yeah, everybody is saying Young Lady Bhela doing just for that!”</p>\n<p>Bhela found it was amazing how people could conjure their own rumors despite not seeing the true story by their own eyes.</p>\n<p>And just when the young ladies started getting excited discussing Young Lady Bhela’s ‘love life’, a vigorous shout resounded the courtyard announcing that Blackwood Family had arrived.</p>\n<p>“Blackwood Family?” someone cocked their head and looked over the direction of the gate. “What kind of family is so bold announcing their names in other family’s ngajen ceremony? Not even Village Head’s Elzhier Family would do to the ceremony host!”</p>\n<p>“Only foreigners to be that stupid to be rude in big family like Malikh! If this is my place I’d send a guard to kick their ass out as soon as possible!”</p>\n<p>“Look over there! Malikh Family elders are rushing to the gate! Let’s check out how’s Malikhs going to deal with it!”</p>\n<p>Curious guests were tailing the elders to see some commotion they thought would occur. However, not only did the Malikhs not make a fuss over it, they even bowed their heads toward the newly arrived noble as if they were servants greeting their returning master. Young people were overly excited because nobles were foreign and appeared in stories all of their lives.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Mila, who already went back with her friend, was gritting teeth with anger. Beside her Romana was holding the tomboy back, though concerned she didn't say a word.</p>\n<p>“Why should I am the one who always had to hold myself back?” Mila hissed in a low voice as if she was wronged.</p>\n<p>“Look around and think about who’s receiving the blow the most. Everyone’s talking about your cousin right now--do you want to make it worse for him?”</p>\n<p>After hearing her friend’s warning, Mila began to take a deep breath and think things through. Romana was right. When she opened her ears Mila could hear people comparing the young master of this noble Blackwood Family with her cousin Shira. They compared such a gallant-looking young noble with a trash of Yashura Family young master, adding with their own biased seasoning here and there, making her cousin Shira look really bad. Mila trembled as her face boiled red from holding back her anger.</p>\n<p>“Where’s Shira right now?”</p>\n<p>“I think he went hiding!” Romana said.</p>\n<p>“Hiding?! He’s embarrassed to show his face that much?”</p>\n<p>After circling around a bit, Mila found the boy’s silhouette in the shadow far from the braziers' light. There, he was squatting, hiding along with two other silhouettes who were also squatting in a suspicious manner.</p>\n<p>“Now, young master, where the hell did you get this coin?” someone whispered from the suspicious bunch.</p>\n<p>The reply came also in the same hushed manner. “Don’t ask me now, just know I’ve got a few more hidden in my house. I can’t move my family, but if you’re fine with this, I can invest in your goods earlier.”</p>\n<p>“We’re fine? Of course we’re fine! Don’t you know how amazing this coin is?”</p>\n<p>“It’s amazing? I can’t even buy satays with this. Nobody here would receive unfamiliar currency.”</p>\n<p>“But don’t you know how far ahead you can go if merchants know you grab some of these coins?”</p>\n<p>“You tell me.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, these coins weren’t issued by any countries, but they’re valuable. Lots of herbs and ingredients in the black markets can only be bought with these coins...”</p>\n<p><em>...whisper whisper whisper...</em></p>\n<p>Mila approached.</p>\n<p>“Ey, what are you doing?!”</p>\n<p>For some reasons, Shira and Monkey, one of his companions, almost jumped in fright by her barking. Both Mila and Romana behind her saw Shira and Monkey were acting suspicious--but Sneak, the third silhouette, didn’t even try to hide that he was nibbling on something delicious.</p>\n<p>Mila, with a weird face, hissed, “Is that… <em>rendang</em> you guys were eating?”</p>\n<p>“<em>Cough, cough,</em>” hiding the opened wrapping banana leaves, Shira awkwardly trying to make an excuse, “I think Malikh Family is too eager to cut off relationships with our Yashura Family so… I reckon they don’t need this anymore…”</p>\n<p>Mila was so angry she slapped the banana leaves in Shira’s hand.</p>\n<p>“Ah, my rendang…”</p>\n<p>“Your rendang?! You goddamn moron!” Mila hissed, she didn’t dare to roar and announce themselves to other guests. “You’re about to get cuckolded and all you think about is a goddamn rendang?!”</p>\n<p>“Young master, someone trying to get you cuckolded?” licking his fingers for some leftover rendang sauce, Snake asked from the side.</p>\n<p>Shira shook his head. “Cuckold is a very strong word. That girl didn’t even consider me from the beginning. It’s not like we're a married couple yet.”</p>\n<p>He then came to pick the spoiled beef and mourned, “ah… my poor rendang.”</p>\n<p>“Stop crying over that shit! It’s not important!”</p>\n<p>Monkey blurted, “Rendang is not important?”</p>\n<p>Mila glared at Monkey. The monkey-faced peddler closed his mouth as soon as he opened it.</p>\n<p>Romana saw her friend Mila had a bad affinity with her cousin whenever she was angry, thus came to explain from the side, “Young Master Shira, don’t you know people outside the Mossack culture do take engagement seriously? It’s understandable for a young heir of a conservative family like Yashura to not care much about it--but, whatever your feelings regarding your engagement is, if Young Lady Bhela has an affair outside, she’ll also drag down Yashura Family’s reputation. So please be mindful about it more for the sake of your family.”</p>\n<p>They didn’t really think about this deeply since straightforward Mossack people were the type to have children before they were even married. If things went awry, Shira reckoned his uncle and the elders in his family might think the engagement matter was similar to puppy love, about children bantering, but the young generation who was exposed to stories and gossips from books and travellers might think about it differently. And someone who didn’t hang out so much like Shira wouldn’t be able to tell how these youngsters would talk about this incident in the future.</p>\n<p>So Shira stood up and patted his trouser, admitted, “Ah, you’re right, Romana.”</p>\n<p>Mila crossed her arms. Frowning at her cousin. “What are you gonna do now? Fight them? No need to be afraid, I’m with you.”</p>\n<p>Snake, still squatting comfortably, added, “Young Master, my grandfather and my older brother are still here too. You won’t be at a disadvantage in case things go downhill.”</p>\n<p>“It’s decided. Let’s kick their asses!” Mila growled.</p>\n<p>“The heck are you talking about kicking people’s asses in Ngajen Ceremony?” Shira grunted.</p>\n<p>“Then at least let me slap that slut’s arrogant face!”</p>\n<p>Shira shook his head.</p>\n<p>“Let’s go,” he said.</p>\n<p>“We’re gonna slap her face now?” Mila asked.</p>\n<p>“No. We at least have to make Family Yashura’s presence known here,” Shira said. He caught his companions’ confused expressions, so he added, “Everyone is getting excited because most of them are young'uns. But if this incident gets out of the hands, the elders from other families won’t be silent about it.”</p>\n<p>Mila wanted to say something but didn’t after seeing Shira’s relaxed face. She didn’t want to say something silly that’d change the boy’s mind. Therefore, with Shira leading the way, she and her friend Romana went to see the ruckus caused by the noble’s arrival. Leaving Monkey and Sneak who were silent looking at their back.</p>\n<p>The two exchanged glances.</p>\n<p>They looked down, eyes sweeping the ground.</p>\n<p>“Mm?” Monkey mumbled, his hands crawling all over the dirt.</p>\n<p>Snake took out a magic wand. The wand shimmered with a gentle light, then he used that to give some light to the ground where the rendang was spoiled.</p>\n<p>But it was Monkey who shouted in joy, “I got one!”</p>\n<p>“Give me that!” Snake pounced the moment he saw Monkey rubbed the dirt of a piece of rendang.</p>\n<p>Pushing out Snake’s face from grabbing the rendang in his hand, Monkey felt wronged and cried, “Why would a rich gentleman like you fight over a single beef with this poor peddler? Don’t you know my family can only afford to eat beef once a year?”</p>\n<p>“Why, you asked?” Snake sneered, “There’s no need to say the obvious. You don’t get to eat Patriarch Shuro’s handmade rendang everyday! And I’m saying this after starving for beef ever since I’m following you.”</p>\n<p>“Fuck off!”</p>\n<p>“Give me that!”</p>\n<p>“No!”</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the shadowy corner where they were wrestling came to be lightened up with a lit torch.</p>\n<p>“Ehem, you two gentlemen,” a voice called.</p>\n<p>For a moment, Monkey and Snake stopped fighting.</p>\n<p>The voice owner was a man with Malikh Family’s servant uniform. Reluctantly, he continued, “Badril Village locals are usually open-minded and tolerant people. However, we have a bottom line. If you two couldn’t hold it you should rent some inn room or do it in the bushes! Don’t do it in the open, you’re making people uncomfortable! Know some shame!”</p>\n<p>Monkey at first didn’t get what the servant was talking about. Then he realized during infighting over the rendang, he had opened his legs, and Snake was on top of him in a very, very awkward manner.</p>\n<p>“Dammit!” he kicked Snake and trembling over the horror he caught himself in. But suddenly he noticed the rendang in his hand already vanished. He whirled his head around. Snake was already licking his fingers with a satisfied face.</p>\n<p>“Dammit!” Monkey howled again.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The one who enthusiastically greeted the young noble of Blackwood Family was Elder Jhamil instead of Bhela Malikh. He managed to conjure thirty years worth of bullshitting skills to flatter and fawn over the other party, rather thick faced to continue despite the young master of noble family rolled his eyes several times. As soon as the young noble caught the sight of a short-haired girl he immediately escaped from Elder Jhamil’s clutch with a big grin on his face.</p>\n<p>“Ah, Sister Bhela!”</p>\n<p>“Young Master Frane Blackwood.”</p>\n<p>“How are you doing Young Lady Bhela? Fancy to meet you again,” he said as he gifted the girl a flower.</p>\n<p>Bhela received the flower but then immediately passed it to a random maidservant beside her. She said as if it was nothing, “I’m fine. Thank you.”</p>\n<p>Young Master Frane Blackwood smiled wryly. “I’ve been travelling with hardly any rest so that I can see you sooner, my young lady,” the young master of Blackwood Family, Frane Blackwood, said, “may I be so lucky to receive your company tonight?”</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry, but here the words ‘tonight’s companion’ have different meanings than when you say it in the western-style ball--so, no, Young Master Blackwood, I can’t give you company tonight,” she said.</p>\n<p>The young noble still had a smile and wanted to correct his wording, but Bhela suddenly raised her hand and said, “Excuse me.”</p>\n<p>She went past him and greeted another pair of guests instead.</p>\n<p>“Greeting, sir, madam.”</p>\n<p>“It’s about time,” the middle-aged man didn’t answer Bhela’s greeting, but complained instead. “You know the other families had begun their ceremonies, right? Even though we don’t have the same ceremony as your Ngajen Ceremony from the place where I come from, but I know those who don’t take any old ceremonies seriously only brought bad luck over their lands.”</p>\n<p>There was a rare restraint in Bhela’s voice as she replied, “I apologize for our bad conduct, Sir Instructor. I will request the elders to proceed with the ceremony. Please let me lead you toward the reserved spot I previously prepared for both of you.”</p>\n<p>“Lead the way then.”</p>\n<p>Badril Village locals witnessed the valiant Young Lady of Malikh Family taking charge of the Ngajen Ceremony as the Chief Chef, but with the appearance of her bowing to two unfamiliar guests as well, whispers were floating amongst the Ngajen Ceremony guests. Before long, everyone knew that two guests Bhela Malikh greeted were the ones she personally invited, but was neglected before the family’s gate because of the excitement made by the noble’s arrival. Bhela came to them to apologize in person.</p>\n<p>Young Master Frane Blackwood, who felt ignored, pulled a self-decrepitating sneer. He complained to Elder Jhamil instead, “Oh, Malikh Family elder, can you tell me the identity of those two guests who made even Young Lady Bhela to bow her head?”</p>\n<p>“Ehem, ehem,” Elder Jhamil didn’t know what to answer, so he concocted a reply out of thin air, “I think they were relatives from her maternal family.”</p>\n<p>“Is that so? From the way they are dressed, they don’t look from that respectable background enough to get the young lady’s full attention. Don’t you think so?”</p>\n<p>“Young noble is right. Young Lady Bhela’s father once was a gangster thus he didn’t manage to teach common sense to the young lady. I’ll talk to her later to explain what’s really important.”</p>\n<p>After a bit of excuse and fawning, Young Master Blackwood felt this Elder Jhamil was acceptable. He told the Blackwood Family’s servants to bring the gifts he had prepared, which were naturally accepted by Elder Jhamil on the young lady’s behalf. In the meantime, people were disappointed that the drama they were expecting didn’t happen. But what could they do besides shaking their heads and disperse?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Year after year, the ngajen ceremony evolved from stiff sessions of praying ceremony for village safety to the new stylish festivities of foods and happy times for the youngsters, where fads and trends emerge. However big their way of life was changing the conservative major families, Yashura and Elzhier, still pretty much followed the old ways, especially when it came to the prayers. Only Malikh Family amongst the three that eager to embrace the new world that was coming. And by Elder Jhamil’s direction, instead of local shamans, Malikh Family asked help from foreign priests from western orthodox temples from nearby villages to lead the prayer.</p>\n<p>It was all good if one made a progressive decision with the greater good in mind. But here was the problem; orthodox temple priests usually led prayers for abundant harvest, while Ngajen Ceremony was all about calming Selaqs from descending the mountain. These priests probably hadn’t any clue how Selaqs looked like.</p>\n<p>“It was inappropriate for a noble to pray to old Mossack deities they don’t believe in, that was Malikhs’ excuses,'' Mila complained non-stop since they finished praying with other guests. In her hands--like a young mother hugging her baby--were plates of food she had just plundered from Malikh Family’s banquet tables prepared to entertain guests.</p>\n<p>“What deity? Wasn’t the mantra replaced from ancient Mossack prayers to magic spell mantra to calm down Selaq since… I don’t know, fifty years ago?” Romana said. The food in her hands was no less than Mila’s. These two girls seemed to think Malikh Family would regret offending them if they plunder the latter’s prepared feast like no tomorrow.</p>\n<p>“That's what I was saying! We no longer those ancient Mossacks who would sacrifice relatives so Selaqs won’t come down the mountain! Nowadays we’ve been using legit spells to keep all those Selaqs away, and these stupid Malikhs want to change the tradition just to appease some visiting noble? They’d rather avoid their noble guest to be uncomfortable than preventing Selaqs from coming down to chew their stupid brains, hah!”</p>\n<p>Compared to noisy girls beside him, Shira was able to keep his head to his feet. Romana signaled Mila with her eyes when she realized the boy wasn’t so into retaliating against the Malikhs; instead of invading the feast Shira, grabbed Malikh Family’s snacks moderately whenever he could--just like any other normal guests that came here.</p>\n<p>Mila grumbled with a bad mood, faced Shira and said, “Don’t you have something you need to do?”</p>\n<p>“Like what?” Shira hoped this cheeky cousin of his wouldn’t say something about kicking people’s asses again.</p>\n<p>“We can’t wait for something to happen,” she said. “Go ask that bitc--I mean, that fiancée of yours--go ask for a dance. The young’uns are starting to get heated. Look there, one of them couples are dancing. You go join them since that short-haired cunt is your fiancée after all.”</p>\n<p>Mila glanced around for a while before she realized she just had her tongue slipped. She quickly corrected her previous words, “Did I say cunt? I mean short-haired bitch--no, short-haired <em>young lady</em>.”</p>\n<p>“Why don’t you just be honest with yourself here. People have been calling Malikhs much worse here because the foreign priests matter!” Romana laughed.</p>\n<p>At that moment a very young maidservant of Malikh Family just passed by and overheard their conversation. The little maidservant snorted in anger, which made Mila snorted back as a retort.</p>\n<p>“Go, go! Go dance with her!” Mila whispered when she was sure only Shira and Romana were around.</p>\n<p>Shira clicked his tongue. “I don’t even have a single proper conversation with her these past ten years. Why should I go ask her dance out of the blue? Just showing our face around here is enough.”</p>\n<p>“Fool! If she accepted to dance with you then all is good, that would only confirm Malikh Family’s cocky attitude is only because their dipshit brains are getting fried by their own inflated proud ego, nothing serious! But if she ignores you in front of others… heh--she dares!”</p>\n<p>“That’s easy for you to say. If someone you don’t like suddenly asks your hands for a dance, what would you feel later on when you found out refusing means two families become enemies?”</p>\n<p>“Uh-uh, I don’t feel nothing. If he’s my fiancé then it’s my job to go my way out to make it clear in public! Going dancing, going kissing, like a proper damned couple! That’s what the goddamn engagement is all about! Right?”</p>\n<p>Mila ate a cookie and she blinked. Unsure of the previous words she said, she glanced at Romana and murmured, “...right?”</p>\n<p>Romana shrugged.</p>\n<p>But Shira wouldn’t back down easily. He continued arguing, “What if your fiancé is Bony Elzhier, then? Are you going to kiss him to prove he’s your fiancé?”</p>\n<p>Mila hid her gasp.</p>\n<p>“You wanna die?” she pursed her lips. “Listen to me or I’m gonna smack your face!”</p>\n<p>Shira groaned against his cousin’s unreasonableness. But before he could concoct a satisfying retort, Snake and Monkey came out of nowhere.</p>\n<p>“Oh, Young Master Shira,” Monkey came patting him on the shoulder, “it seems you get cuckolded for real this time.”</p>\n<p>People were clapping and whistling as the flashy Young Master Frane Blackwood led Young Lady Bhela Malikh by the hand.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Malikh was entertaining two guests previously, but that bald elder raised a fuss about how she neglected the young noble, so in the end it came to this.”</p>\n<p>Monkey laughed as he teased Shira with his elbow, “They’re going to dance. When two people were dancing in Ngajen Ceremony, that meant they--” he caught the scary experssion on Mila’s face, stopped, “nevermind…”</p>\n<p>“That slut!” Mila hissed.</p>\n<p>This was getting serious. Whenever Mila showed that kind of face something bad would happen. Again, the moment Shira opened his mouth to say something, someone else came to grab him in the shoulder.</p>\n<p>“Brat, your woman is going to cuckold you in public,” said the newcomer, Good-Natured Spirit, who literally came out of the thin air.</p>\n<p>“You too?”</p>\n<p>Shira had a headache. Both Monkey and Snake couldn’t see the annoying Good-Natured Spirit, but the three of them were in harmony in mocking him. They mocked him to the point saying he wouldn’t care would only embarrass him further.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, being led by the hand, Bhela Malikh asked Young Master Blackwood, “What kind of remedy Blackwood Family brought with you?”</p>\n<p>“Why so much in hurry, my young lady?” the young noble gave a laugh and a flash of smile. “No need to worry, Blackwood Family sympathize with the disaster that befell your father, so my mother send me here to personally deliver the medicine Blackwood House had sought far and wide.”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh said nothing more. The Young Master of Blackwood Family pondered as he read the cold expression of the girl, thinking that even with flowers and jewelry gifts, nothing could move this young lady. Such a waste of that beautiful face to not letting a single smile escaped, Young Master Blackwood could only smacked his lips and shook his head. But as soon as he mentioned a medicine he brought for her father, the feisty young lady became amiable almost immediately.</p>\n<p>Good thing for him. Bhela Malikh was talented, the Blackwood Family planned to have her inside their house, and if things went this smoothly he could do that his mother told him sooner than he expected.</p>\n<p>“Little bitch of Malikh Family,” a girl roared, “you finally show your true color you bitch! Is Yashura Family a joke to you?!”</p>\n<p>The furious Mila Yashura became the center of attention. She snorted as she strode, like an angry bull preparing to charge, with the mood that would make the crowd wordlessly give way to her. Not only because they didn’t want anything to do with the infamous young lady of Yashura Family--who, when angry, once punched Bony in the face with a nosebleed--but also because she got a sword in her hands.</p>\n<p>Shira glanced down. His father’s sword he brought with him was gone. He looked again at the unsheated weapon in his cousin’s hands.</p>\n<p>He could only slap his own face the moment he noticed what was happened.</p>\n<p>Mila took a step forward slowly, but her face turned even fiercer. She spoke, “You got guts to bring a lover from outside, eh? I knew something fishy happened when I saw you cut your hair, you little slut.”</p>\n<p>“I cut my hair because it got in the way during my training,” Bhela replied plainly. “And this is not my lover. Just a relative of my friend.”</p>\n<p>“You lying little slut. As if someone like you have any friends!”</p>\n<p>“I do have a friend.” Bhela said. A rare emphasizing tone in her voice was telling that she was upset, but she held back from explaining further.</p>\n<p>“I don’t care what your excuse is! Do you think I don’t know what you shitty Malikhs up to? You already don’t put Yashura Family in your eyes, eh? Just because you bitch have a little vacation outside, eh? If you think you’re a big shot, why don’t you prove it here and now?!”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh was silent for a while. Looking at Mila, she then asked, “And what are you suggesting I should do, Young Lady Yashura?”</p>\n<p>Mila stabbed her sword into the ground.</p>\n<p>“I just want to know how awesome is this Archer class you’ve got overseas that makes you Malikhs stop putting us Yashuras in your eyes,” Mila sneered. “Why don’t we test it with my sword, eh? Let’s do a duel, bitch.”</p>\n<p>Bhela just looked at Mila strangely.</p>\n<p>“But you’re a Specialist class,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Aha! Getting scared, aren’t ya, you little cunt?”</p>\n<p>Bhela didn’t want to argue with her. So she told the nearest servant to go grab a bow.</p>\n<p>On the other side, Monkey anxiously elbowed Shira, said, “Should I drag your cousin back?”</p>\n<p>“Stand down, mister. Mila is the one who’s starting it. She can’t afford to back down now.”</p>\n<p>Beside them Snake was nodding as he understood what Shira meant.</p>\n<p>Then with a laugh, Good-Natured Spirit, who was already tired jeering him, said to Shira. “Kid, shit just got real. Ain’t that a good idea to pull her before it’s too late?”</p>\n<p>Shira wanted to but he couldn’t. He knew exactly Mila’s strength. Fighting bare hands, she might get a chance to stand against the strongest youngster in the village, but it would become a different story when weapons and mana were involved.</p>\n<p>Since Mila was the one to propose the duel, bailing out before the fight began would be slapping her own face in front of the guests. It was a bad idea, because Mila didn’t appear to have the slightest chance to win. So bad that it’d be more reasonable to just surrender. But Shira knew Mila hated to go back on her words the most. Thus he silently moved closer to her, prepared to pull her back in before the situation really got out of his hands.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Young Master Blackwood, was pulled out by an adjutant of his family.</p>\n<p>Smirking, he asked the adjutant, “Who is that girl who picking a fight with Bhela?”</p>\n<p>“Seems like the eldest young lady of that family,” the adjutant replied.</p>\n<p>“You mean the family my Bhela got engaged to?” Young Master Frane Blackwood asked as if Bhela already his. The corner of his lips curled as he thought this might be a good chance to do something on the engagement that Blackwood House already saw as a thorn in their eyes. “Do you have something on that girl?”</p>\n<p>“Replying to young master, since Yashura Family is the main obstacle for us to get Young Lady Bhela Malikh to our side, your mother has already sent someone to investigate them. The eldest young lady of Yashura Family merely a Level 10 Specialist class who just graduated from Novice about seven months ago.”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood couldn’t help but chuckle. Even though the two young ladies had the same level, a Specialist merely support class that wasn’t suited in combat. This duel affair would turn out to be a joke.</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood scoffed. “Let my Bhela teach her some manners. I don’t want anyone to disturb us after this.”</p>\n<p>“Young master,” the adjutant lowered his voice, “I don’t think that’s a good idea.”</p>\n<p>“What’s on your mind, adjutant?”</p>\n<p>“I just made a round to check the guests attending this ceremony, and I found…”--he lowered his voice--“...some spectators amongst the guests that shouldn’t have be here….”</p>\n<p>“Go on,” the young noble urged.</p>\n<p>“I just received the word, young master, there are experts that Elder Jhamil said he didn’t invite.”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood frowned. “What… what’s that supposed to mean?”</p>\n<p>On the less crowded place of the courtyard, the middle-aged man who Bhela greeted before, along with the middle-aged woman, watched the commotion unfold while nibbling on steamed peanuts. He glanced at the other place where a man calmly sipping tea, a man with a hard face who couldn’t hide his sharp aura, then swept his gaze at the one who beside him, a short stature man who wore a headband to hide his reddish hair from public, who also happened to enjoy steamed peanuts while his focus solely at one direction in the crowd.</p>\n<p>All of them came in common garments incognito. But still Elder Jhamil sent people to keep tabs on them, especially since the bald elder still didn’t know the reason Bhela Malikh invited these foreigners.</p>\n<p>The ngajen ceremony usually consisted of three main parts--prayer, socializing, and sending offerings to the mountain as the finale. It was uncommon for irrelevant events to happen between them. However, since the young lady of the host had already accepted the duel, Malikh Family set up an emergency venue for the fight.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil came to invite himself as the judge. For a change to hummiliate those simple Yashuras and to slip himself onto the spotlight, he couldn’t ask for better opportunity.</p>\n<p>“You two ready?” Elder Jhamil asked both of the opposing sides. “This is a friendly match between two friendly families. So stop before your blade hit your enemy,” he said, seemingly talking to either sides, but didn’t say anything about the arrows part.</p>\n<p>Since Bhela Malikh was an Archer, she suggested to Mila, “I’m using a bow. So you can move first. I’ll try to dodge for ten seconds.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t need that,” Mila scoffed.</p>\n<p>“Very well…” she said. She glanced at Elder Jhamil, said, “Elder Jhamil, please begin the duel.&quot;</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil counted to three.</p>\n<p>The duel began.</p>\n<p>“AAAAAA!!!” Mila roared with the sword raised above her head, charging ahead.</p>\n<p>Contrast to her opponent’s battle cry, Bhela was solemn. She picked four arrows from the quiver tied on her hips. Nocking the arrows simultaneously, she took a deep breath as she concentrated to channel different natures elemental mana from her manasphere. The mana, through fingers and her thumb, flowing into all the four arrows and soon the tip of the arrows glowed with four different colors.</p>\n<p>The wind began to stir.</p>\n<p>And she raised the bow. She released the arrows.</p>\n<p><em>Fuuush fuuuushhh fuuushh shhuuuuusshh!</em></p>\n<p>Before even everyone noticed what happened, the mana Bhela channeled melted the flying arrows, within a span of milliseconds, turning them into dangerous magic projectiles of four elemental natures--fire, water, wind and lightning.</p>\n<p>Mila was confident before. She knew a trick against an Archer, but here she was dumbfounded by magic arrows coming to blast her way. She thought she was fighting an Archer, but got up against a Mage instead. This wasn’t what she signed up for.</p>\n<p><em>Clank!</em></p>\n<p>The first blue arrow dissapeared almost the moment it reached Mila. The sound of metallic clash that followed the said arrow resounded three more times, and the three arrows left behind too disappeared almost immediately. Mila, thought she ought to dodge the magic arrows, leap a step backward, but her hasty movement combined with the slippery mud made her slipped her foothold, accidentally fell to her butt instead.</p>\n<p>Bhela aimed down her bow. Everyone was staring at her with complicated and questioning gaze, as an Archer who could do magic, this was the first time everyone witnessed it.</p>\n<p>“It’s a four elemental affinity spell!” someone’s voice roared through the silenced venue, “I heard it, I doubted it, but she really did it!”</p>\n<p>Everyone looked at his way, the man who shouted, and saw that it was the middle-aged man whom Bhela invited from outside the village. He sat eating steamed peanuts then, now he was standing perplexed.</p>\n<p>Bhela, realizing that the man was the center of the attention, and bow to him from afar.</p>\n<p>“She really did it…” the man said under his breath.</p>\n<p>Someone who sat beside him said, “Sure she did, the only one right now--I guess now that you big brain from Elemental Stone School witnessed it I guess you can die without regret?”</p>\n<p>The man looked at the woman who accompanied him, he said still with expression of disbelieve, “It’s a four elemental affinity spell…”</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, you already said that.”</p>\n<p>The last and the most famous multi elemental Unique Class was, a mage with three elemental affinity skills, died of old age--was actually the headmaster of Elemental Stone School from seventy years ago. As a scholar and a mage researching deeply in topics of elemental mana all of his career, how could he didn’t know the value of a Unique Class who surpassed even the ex-headmaster of his school?</p>\n<p>“I can’t believe someone without a Mage Unique Class really did it…”</p>\n<p>“The most promising talent of this generation, alright, the first time I witnessed an Archer could do magic,” the woman said. “Good thing she stopped her arrows then--if not, the other girl would ended up so pitiful.”</p>\n<p>As the woman said that, someone else blurted not far away from there.</p>\n<p>“She didn’t stop it.”</p>\n<p>“Pardon? Sir Kurusiya?” the woman asked.</p>\n<p>The one she was talking to was the quiet man with sharp aura. He said as a matter of fact like tone, “She didn’t stop it. Someone else did,” he sipped his tea, and when the woman still confused, he explained with hoarse voice, “those are magic, but they were still arrows shot from a bow. You can’t stop flying arrows. That girl calculated and slightly missed her aim as to not hurting her opponent. But she didn’t plan to stop it.”</p>\n<p>The woman questioned him, “If she wasn’t the one who stopped it, then would you know why the arrows disappears?”</p>\n<p>The man put down his glass of tea. “I don’t know. Why you ask me? Ask that fool there who’s been grinning all the time.”</p>\n<p>The woman, along with the middle-aged man from Stone Elemental School, looked up to the bearded foreigner.</p>\n<p>“She’s not the one who stopped it,” the bearded man said with a smile.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Mila, who mellowed from her defeat and still sat on the muddy ground, gulped as she saw her cousin come to pick her up.</p>\n<p>“I lost,” she said to Shira.</p>\n<p>“No you didn’t, that girl is the one who put down her bow first, and you still got your swords in your hands--so technically you’d win.”</p>\n<p>“I fell to my butt, I was humiliated,” Mila said, her voice trembled, “I lost….”</p>\n<p>Shira sighed. He grabbed Mila’s hand and pulled her up. “It’s adult problems from hereon, Uncle Shuro would likely summon my father back. For now, let’s get out of here,” he said.</p>\n<p>Monkey and Snake, along with the nervous Romana, came to follow them from behind to shield them from people’s laughter. Mila was so humiliated the usually feisty tomboy was so down she couldn’t afford to hold her head straight. As Shira witnessed how pitiful his cousin was, regret overwhelming him when he remembered how he was holding back from taking action himself.</p>\n<p>“Brat,” someone called him.</p>\n<p>Shira turned his head. It was Good-Natured Spirit.</p>\n<p>“You owe me this time,” the Nalaq said.</p>\n<p>Shira nodded.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>“Hear ye hear ye people! Gather around and hear me announce something incredible, people! Gather around, will ya!”</p>\n<p>Standing on top of a table, Elder Jhamil shouted to gather people, announcing something that the Young Master of Blackwood Family passed him beforehands. “Although winner of the duel is Young Lady Bhela, Young Master Frane of Blackwood House is concerned by some stupid unruly girl of the supposed biggest family in Badril Village behavior would smear my young lady--”</p>\n<p>“Big news! Big news!” someone else’s shouting cut off Elder Jhamil’s announcement, “Young Master Bonithon is running around beating people! Watch your mouth if you don’t want get beaten for no reason!”</p>\n<p>“Bony is going crazy! He’s going to kick people’s asses! Nobody knows why!”</p>\n<p>“What the fuck is going on! Why Elzhier Family messing with us Malikhs now?”</p>\n<p>At the chaotic scene before him, Elder Jhamil’s face showed a frown and a hint of hesitation. He then cleared his phlegm anyway, trying to get people’s attention, then pushed on announcing carefully, “Young Master Frane Blackwood is concerned that--”</p>\n<p>“Elder Jhamil!!” a servant came running with a horrified expression, “Bony is coming for you, run away!”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil pointed his finger at the servant and roared, “What is that brat from Elzhier Family wants to do with me! Go kick him out, I’m trying to tell everybody something important here!”</p>\n<p>“But he doesn’t listen to reasons! He’s going to punch your face, is what he said just now!”</p>\n<p>“Imbecile! Do you think a young master would jump around like a monkey and punch an elder of another family in the damn face?! He’s making ruckus. Go on, kick him out!”</p>\n<p>Looking at the crowd from the rushedly made stage, he then smiled and continued, “Right, everybody, it’s Young Master of Blackwood Family; what I’m saying is that since Young Lady Bhela Malikh is winning with ease against the foolish young lady of <em>that</em> family, Young Master Blackwood concerned that some people would shrug my young lady’s victory. So he proposed, in order to make it clear the disparity between Malikh and--sheesh--Yashura, he proposed that him as a friendly representative of Malikh Family and Shira Yashura as the repre--”</p>\n<p>“Elder Jhamil--watch out!”</p>\n<p>He had it taking from lowly servants who cut off his announcement. Fuming in anger, Elder Jhamil pointed his finger toward the one who was spriting toward him and roared, “How many times I told you to just kick him out! Shut your trap and go kick the damned brat!”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was losing his cool. But what he failed to realize in time was that the one who sprinted toward him wasn’t a servant from his family. It was not the one who telling him to run away. And before he knew it, someone leaped up on the table where he was standing and delivered a punch to the face.</p>\n<p>“Gaaahhh!”</p>\n<p>Even after Elder Jhamil stumbled down the table he stood on, his assaulter didn’t plan to let him go. And what came after that was a torrent of hardened fist, pummeling his face even though he screamed for mercy. Only when the chaotic crowd succeeded in saving him did Elder Jhamil see the assaulter’s face--it was indeed the Young Master from Elzhier Family.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Bonithon… what did you… why did you do this… for what reason?!” Elder Jhamil choked out his grievance.</p>\n<p>Bony, the man who beat the bald elder black and blue, replied with nothing but a cold stare. Instead, it was an almost incoherent voice of Pilek who answered instead.</p>\n<p>“Kekekek, don’t be angry Elder Baldy! We just discussed how you were a splendid Pugilist a long time ago, so Boss Bony came here to find out whether it was true or not! That’s why he asked you to a barehand duel!” Pilek came in with a swagger and a bottle of booze in his hand. From a single glance anybody could tell he was drunk.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s lips trembled. What duel? That brat just leaped out of nowhere without saying anything, then immediately beating him black and blue!</p>\n<p>The only one from the three delinquents who hadn’t had the smell of liquor from his body was Polio. He wore an apologetic smile, and with a slight sigh, he said, “Please forgive them, dear kind Malikh sirs, my friends are terrible when they are drunk.”</p>\n<p>Polio made a round to apologize to any Malikhs he saw. But the Malikh Family didn’t appreciate his gesture, receiving jeerings in return.</p>\n<p>Polio was a patient young man, but Pilek wasn’t. The drunk Pilek didn’t take their attitude kindly, randomly walking to a servant, said, “Hah? What the fuck are you staring me at, you no-name Malikh servant? Wanna die, eh? Huuuraah!!!”</p>\n<p><em>Shatter!</em></p>\n<p>Without a warning he swung the booze in his hand to a Malikh family servant. The man he attacked stumbled backward holding his bloodied head from the crash Pilek gave him.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Bhela Malikh had just settled greeting four foreign guests that she invited from outside, and was on her way to fetch cuisines from the kitchen to humor her guests, then she witnessed the chaotic brawl unfold with a crowdful of cheers and jeers mixed in between. Perhaps there were more than a dozen men involved, with the Malikhs servants, guards, common family members even an elder came along to surround Bony and his two underlings.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela…” a little maidservant with a crest of Elzhier Family in her uniform bowed to Bhela politely.</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at her. She returned the bow even though the other party clearly was a servant. “Miss Elzhier,” she spoke softly.</p>\n<p>“No need to be polite to this servant, Young Lady.”</p>\n<p>“I can’t be impolite to Sister Ryntia’s friends.”</p>\n<p>The Elzhier Family maidservant smiled. Since Bhela insisted, then she wouldn’t be bowing her head anymore.</p>\n<p>She said, “Eldest Young Lady sends me to ask for your forgiveness for her brother’s brashness, Young Lady Bhela.”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at the brawl that started in her family’s courtyard. This chaos would spell imperfect on tonight's Malikh Family’s Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>“There’s no need for that. Since I accepted Young Lady Mila Yashura’s duel then I somewhat anticipated Young Master Bonithon will follow suit to make trouble tonight. If anything, it is I the one who should apologize to Sister Ryntia because I couldn’t handle the situation well. Please tell her that I’ll try to maintain friendship between Malikh and Elzhier Family.”</p>\n<p>Still with the serene smile on her face, the Elzhier Family maidservant studied the expression on Bhela’s face. She spoke a moment after, “Then I’ll let Eldest Young Lady Elzhier knows by tomorrow.”</p>\n<p>“Thanks,” Bhela offered her gratitude with a bow.</p>\n<p>By this time, the brawl became anything but intensified, as men either from Elzhier Family or thugs that previously had dealings with Bony’s group came in to reinforce the Elzhier young master. Before the Malikhs could pressure the intruders with numbers, but then the completely overwhelmed by the new reinforcement.</p>\n<p>“Huurraaahh!” Pilek sent a Malikh man flying with his kick. “Where the fuck your previous cocky taunt? Cat got your tongue, eh?”</p>\n<p>The only unspoken rules in brawls were strictly no usage of mana and spell as well as no sharp objects to use as weapons. But when it was chaotic and nobody could watch everybody the sharpest mind with tricks the one who prevailed--this is why the likes of Pilek and his friend Polio who always struck in place people wouldn’t be willing the one who were taking the advantage in brawls. Even hunters and seasoned guards were no match against these naughty brats.</p>\n<p>For example, when Pilek’s punch was blocked by Elder Jhamil’s son, “You shitty brat, just wait till I deal with your father--kuukgghh!”</p>\n<p>And because no one was watching, Pilek used his knee to strike the cocky young elder in the balls.</p>\n<p>With a sad whimper from his trembling lips, Elder Jhamil’s son curled onto the ground holding his precious balls that Polio struck.</p>\n<p>Seeing that a family elder was mercilessly defeated, a few Malikhs came to avenge their young elder. By then, Pilek already had Polio watching over his back.</p>\n<p>At that point, no Malikhs could match them in hand-in-hand brawl.</p>\n<p>A stranger then casually walked in. Pilek stopped, looking at him, and amidst the chaotic scene it took a while for him to find out that the man was actually a foreigner--an eastern Kaya man. The man had a sheathed sword on his hips. But Pilek wasn’t afraid as long as he stick with the brawl rules to use only fighting unarmed.</p>\n<p>“Huurraaah!”</p>\n<p>Pilek threw a feint. Most simple Malikhs would fall for this. But the eastern Kaya man didn’t budge. Seemed to even anticipate it. With a movement too fast for Pilek to follow the man grabbed his wrist, flicked him and sent him into the air like it was nothing.</p>\n<p>It was only after Pilek rolled in the mud he realized what had happened.</p>\n<p>The man then glanced aside and walked toward Polio who in his own right was too engrossed with the brawl. With his left hand pushing Polio’s shoulder and the other hand grabbing his wrist, he flipped Polio just like he did Pilek beforehand.</p>\n<p>Pilek and a few others that the man previously flipped were amazed by how effortlessly the man disabling enthusiastic young men from fighting.</p>\n<p>The sword handle the man had was wrapped with cloth and its body too thin for regular blades. Those who noticed this would understand that the man wasn’t an ordinary Kaya. Polio was one of them.</p>\n<p>“A Samurai!” he exclaimed a moment after he got thrown onto the muddy ground.</p>\n<p>The Kaya man stopped, looking at him, then spoke with a displeased tone, “I am but a masterless ronin.”</p>\n<p>The man then continued walking toward a different direction.</p>\n<p>Bony was fighting with three men alone, so he couldn’t afford to look around. He didn’t realize the Kaya man at first, but when the man tried to grab the wild young master’s wrist, Bony reacted--he reacted by throwing a punch to the man’s face.</p>\n<p>The man slapped his flying fist from the side, tremendously muffled its momentum. Again, he tried to grab Bony’s wrist and his shoulder. Bony tried resisting but the man’s speed was too fast for him to compete.</p>\n<p>As the man prepared to flip him, Bony felt a faint gush of the wind from his legs. It didn’t take him a second to realize the man just putting his hand on his shoulder as a feint--his real target was to gently nudge his foot on rooting from the ground, which, if he’d focus his effort to get his shoulder free from the man’s grasp, a small window of opening that could be used by his opponent to disrupt his sense of balance. Thus Bony firmly stomped his feet to the ground instead. He grabbed the man’s sleeve to make his opponent not be able to easily throw like Pilek and Polio.</p>\n<p>Responding to Bony’s choice, the man curled the corner of his lips. Bony caught a hint of taunt when he staring the man in the eyes.</p>\n<p>“Kkuuuggghh!”</p>\n<p>Bony did succeed in preventing himself get flipped to the ground. But he got struck in the gut instead.</p>\n<p>The man didn’t let him go. The moment Bony stepping backward due to shock having stricken, the man was charging and got his wrist in the blink of the eyes--what happened afterward was Bony got his feet swept and he completely lost his ground, and got cheered by his friends as the last man who got thrown into the mud.</p>\n<p>Bony then sat there looking as the fight stopped; since someone took him down, more and less the Malikhs had won the brawl.</p>\n<p>“Aren’t you Thoqek’s son?” the Kaya man asked Bony.</p>\n<p>Bony wasn’t willing to open his mouth when his father’s name got mentioned.</p>\n<p>Receiving no answer, the man thus carelessly said, “Unexpectedly, you’ve got more guts than your father. Get up now, and stop making trouble in Ghalim Malikh’s home.”</p>\n<p>The young ruffians with Bony as the leader naturally wouldn’t be arrogant anymore since they had been defeated. They retreated calmly, and the Malikhs didn’t dare taunt them the second time in case Bony would change his mind and started on a rampage again. In the end, the real reason why Bony came targeting Malikh Family, as many people knew, was that he wasn’t a drinker that would lose reason to punch another family’s elder in the face.</p>\n<p>Speaking about an elder who got a punch in the face; after Bony and others were gone, Elder Jhamil showed his nose out of his hiding place. He gritted his teeth. He swore he’d use his full resource to get back from Bony’s father in the next village council meeting.</p>\n<p>“Elder Jhamil, you still haven’t announced the thing I ask you to do,” from behind, the sullen young noble Frane Blackwood said to him.</p>\n<p>“Y-young Master Blackwood, please spare me--the mood isn’t that good to draw people’s attention after that kid crashing our Ngajen Ceremony just now. How about I brief it to other village leaders tomorrow in the village council meeting?”</p>\n<p>“No, I want everyone to know it by tonight. This is the right time and the right place to announce it. Besides, I want to see what kind of a young man the one who’s supposed to be my rival.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil didn’t want to show his beaten face to the crowd tonight. But as much as he love his face he knew flattery wouldn’t get him out of this situation--at least not if he didn’t want to offend the young noble. And so with a heavy face he climbed the table once again, hiding off his reluctancy.</p>\n<p>Someone heartily made a joke on him, “Elder Jhamil, we thought you’re a man who care about face the most--I don’t expect you to boldly show how handsome you’ve become now!”</p>\n<p>“Kids nowadays getting big headed by their privileges as young masters--naturally I’ll let their fathers know how to discipline their brats!” Elder Jhamil coldly said. “Anyway, you all know that my Young Lady Bhela is a girl with talent and her future is boundless. Here in Malikh Family we’re not willing to throw our princess to cow’s dunk that is Yashura Family’s trash young master. And our friend Young Noble Frane Blackwood also thinks the same!”</p>\n<p>Such passionate speech, naturally people were cheering in anticipation of the next spectacle they thought they were going to witness.</p>\n<p>Getting the cue from Elder Jhamil, Frane Blackwood came forward with a swagger. “I speak this as a close friend of Young Lady Bhela Malikh. Someone with the name of Shira Yashura; if you think you’re worthy of her, do you dare to prove it by having a duel with me?!”</p>\n<p>The crowd was silent. They were waiting for the reply.</p>\n<p>Frane Blackwood swept the crowd with his eyes.</p>\n<p>Someone said to him the boy he challenged was utter trash. He was amused guessing how this trash would respond to his duel challenge, especially when Bhela Malikh had just completely defeated the cheeky young lady from his family.</p>\n<p>There were already murmurs spreading. People were also curious whether Shira was going to accept or run away from it.</p>\n<p>And then…</p>\n<p>“<em>Cough, cough…</em>” someone awkwardly stepped forward with a wry smile plastered on his face. People recognized his face, which looked like a monkey, and many of them had seen him together with Shira Yashura.</p>\n<p>He was Monkey. He said, “This young noble… about your proposed duel… I’m afraid Young Master Shira Yashura can’t answer it tonight.”</p>\n<p>Frane Blackwood laughed. “Why? He’s scared? His cousin challenged Young Lady Bhela to a duel for no apparent reason; don’t tell me we can do the same to them?”</p>\n<p>“No, it’s not that.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil pointed his finger at Monkey. “We all know Shira Yashura is a trash who can’t even advance to Level 4 Novice! Young Master Frane Blackwood is kind. Tonight, he’s going to give Shira one chance to admit that he’s unworthy of Young Lady Bhela Malikh to the crowd here. He does that, and there will be no need for Young Master Frane Blackwood to embarrass him by kicking his ass!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, but he can’t give you an answer tonight,” Monkey insisted.</p>\n<p>Now it was Elder Jhamil who laughed. “He’s really scared facing Young Master Frane right now?!”</p>\n<p>“No…”</p>\n<p>“Then why?”</p>\n<p>Monkey sighed.</p>\n<p>“Because he’s already gone home!”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was furious. The whole point he had to gather people even though his face had been beaten by Bony was to call out the boy and embarrass him in public, as per the young noble request. But the said person himself already went home, so Elder Jhamil standing on top of the table was for nothing.</p>\n<p>Immediately he ordered a servant to send the message to Yashura Family, while in between, cursing the fact that he didn’t get the chance to distract the guests from discussing the previous brawl. Sure enough, not only the people were talking about Bhela Malikh’s hidden Unique Class, they were also talking about Bony, and people he beat to pulp, especially Elder Jhamil. People no longer cared to gossip about Young Lady Mila Yashura who had been sent home defeated, but they laughed at someone present who had just his misfortune like Elder Jhamil instead.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil had lost his face in the end. Literally and metaphorically.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, with a solemn expression Monkey looked at his partner Snake who was enjoying the banquet and had amused himself watching the spectacle previously.</p>\n<p>Monkey said with a whisper, “Why the hell your family doesn’t show his face when they dumping shit to Young Master and Young Lady Yashura just now?!”</p>\n<p>Snake glanced at him lazily. “I don’t know. They said they were going to diagnose Patriarch Ghalim Malikh previously.”</p>\n<p>“Can’t you just fetch your brother instead? Didn’t you put your words to assure young master before this? What if he thinks we’re people who put our words lightly?”</p>\n<p>“The one who’s diagnosing the patriarch is my grandfather, my brother supposed to be free enough to be a busybody just now,” Snake said, displeased by Monkey’s tone accusing him of being unloyal to his own word.</p>\n<p>Actually, he also confused why his brother didn’t show his nose when Young Lady Mila recklessly brought a sword to challenge Bhela to a duel. From his understanding of his brother’s character and the relationship between his family and Yashura from what he knew told him that more or less his brother was going to back Yashura if the drama with Malikh Family intensified. But he didn’t. Snake would barge into Malikh Family’s doors to look for his grandfather if he knew it was going to be like this instead.</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-5/chapter-4":"<p>Badril Village, though had been two years passed without her presence, was the same as always for Bhela Malikh. She hadn’t that many acquaintances her age she could consider friendly before. In spite of that, from the day she returned, people act as if they were her rekindled childhood friends she never knew she had.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” a daughter of an elder from Elzhier Family asked curiously, “is the rumor about that story true?”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at her with eyelids half-closed.</p>\n<p>“Which rumor?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, silly you, of course <em>that</em> rumor! The one about your romance with a blue blood noble!”</p>\n<p>Giggles of girls followed after the girl’s words. When Bhela returned to Badril Village she brought not only fame and reputation, but interesting stories and rumors as well. She was currently surrounded by curious young ladies who sought for exciting gossip.</p>\n<p>“Yeah, yeah!” another girl excitedly hussing in low voice. “I heard he’ll attend Malikh’s ngajen ceremony tonight!”</p>\n<p>“Really?”</p>\n<p>“Why else would Young Lady Bhela take the Chef Chief position if she didn’t expect for her lover to come tonight? He’ll come for sure!”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, yeah, everybody is saying Young Lady Bhela doing just for that!”</p>\n<p>Bhela found it was amazing how people could conjure their own rumors despite not seeing the true story by their own eyes.</p>\n<p>And just when the young ladies started getting excited discussing Young Lady Bhela’s ‘love life’, a vigorous shout resounded the courtyard announcing that Blackwood Family had arrived.</p>\n<p>“Blackwood Family?” someone cocked their head and looked over the direction of the gate. “What kind of family is so bold announcing their names in other family’s ngajen ceremony? Not even Village Head’s Elzhier Family would do to the ceremony host!”</p>\n<p>“Only foreigners to be that stupid to be rude in big family like Malikh! If this is my place I’d send a guard to kick their ass out as soon as possible!”</p>\n<p>“Look over there! Malikh Family elders are rushing to the gate! Let’s check out how’s Malikhs going to deal with it!”</p>\n<p>Curious guests were tailing the elders to see some commotion they thought would occur. However, not only did the Malikhs not make a fuss over it, they even bowed their heads toward the newly arrived noble as if they were servants greeting their returning master. Young people were overly excited because nobles were foreign and appeared in stories all of their lives.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Mila, who already went back with her friend, was gritting teeth with anger. Beside her Romana was holding the tomboy back, though concerned she didn't say a word.</p>\n<p>“Why should I am the one who always had to hold myself back?” Mila hissed in a low voice as if she was wronged.</p>\n<p>“Look around and think about who’s receiving the blow the most. Everyone’s talking about your cousin right now--do you want to make it worse for him?”</p>\n<p>After hearing her friend’s warning, Mila began to take a deep breath and think things through. Romana was right. When she opened her ears Mila could hear people comparing the young master of this noble Blackwood Family with her cousin Shira. They compared such a gallant-looking young noble with a trash of Yashura Family young master, adding with their own biased seasoning here and there, making her cousin Shira look really bad. Mila trembled as her face boiled red from holding back her anger.</p>\n<p>“Where’s Shira right now?”</p>\n<p>“I think he went hiding!” Romana said.</p>\n<p>“Hiding?! He’s embarrassed to show his face that much?”</p>\n<p>After circling around a bit, Mila found the boy’s silhouette in the shadow far from the braziers' light. There, he was squatting, hiding along with two other silhouettes who were also squatting in a suspicious manner.</p>\n<p>“Now, young master, where the hell did you get this coin?” someone whispered from the suspicious bunch.</p>\n<p>The reply came also in the same hushed manner. “Don’t ask me now, just know I’ve got a few more hidden in my house. I can’t move my family, but if you’re fine with this, I can invest in your goods earlier.”</p>\n<p>“We’re fine? Of course we’re fine! Don’t you know how amazing this coin is?”</p>\n<p>“It’s amazing? I can’t even buy satays with this. Nobody here would receive unfamiliar currency.”</p>\n<p>“But don’t you know how far ahead you can go if merchants know you grab some of these coins?”</p>\n<p>“You tell me.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, these coins weren’t issued by any countries, but they’re valuable. Lots of herbs and ingredients in the black markets can only be bought with these coins...”</p>\n<p><em>...whisper whisper whisper...</em></p>\n<p>Mila approached.</p>\n<p>“Ey, what are you doing?!”</p>\n<p>For some reasons, Shira and Monkey, one of his companions, almost jumped in fright by her barking. Both Mila and Romana behind her saw Shira and Monkey were acting suspicious--but Sneak, the third silhouette, didn’t even try to hide that he was nibbling on something delicious.</p>\n<p>Mila, with a weird face, hissed, “Is that… <em>rendang</em> you guys were eating?”</p>\n<p>“<em>Cough, cough,</em>” hiding the opened wrapping banana leaves, Shira awkwardly trying to make an excuse, “I think Malikh Family is too eager to cut off relationships with our Yashura Family so… I reckon they don’t need this anymore…”</p>\n<p>Mila was so angry she slapped the banana leaves in Shira’s hand.</p>\n<p>“Ah, my rendang…”</p>\n<p>“Your rendang?! You goddamn moron!” Mila hissed, she didn’t dare to roar and announce themselves to other guests. “You’re about to get cuckolded and all you think about is a goddamn rendang?!”</p>\n<p>“Young master, someone trying to get you cuckolded?” licking his fingers for some leftover rendang sauce, Snake asked from the side.</p>\n<p>Shira shook his head. “Cuckold is a very strong word. That girl didn’t even consider me from the beginning. It’s not like we're a married couple yet.”</p>\n<p>He then came to pick the spoiled beef and mourned, “ah… my poor rendang.”</p>\n<p>“Stop crying over that shit! It’s not important!”</p>\n<p>Monkey blurted, “Rendang is not important?”</p>\n<p>Mila glared at Monkey. The monkey-faced peddler closed his mouth as soon as he opened it.</p>\n<p>Romana saw her friend Mila had a bad affinity with her cousin whenever she was angry, thus came to explain from the side, “Young Master Shira, don’t you know people outside the Mossack culture do take engagement seriously? It’s understandable for a young heir of a conservative family like Yashura to not care much about it--but, whatever your feelings regarding your engagement is, if Young Lady Bhela has an affair outside, she’ll also drag down Yashura Family’s reputation. So please be mindful about it more for the sake of your family.”</p>\n<p>They didn’t really think about this deeply since straightforward Mossack people were the type to have children before they were even married. If things went awry, Shira reckoned his uncle and the elders in his family might think the engagement matter was similar to puppy love, about children bantering, but the young generation who was exposed to stories and gossips from books and travellers might think about it differently. And someone who didn’t hang out so much like Shira wouldn’t be able to tell how these youngsters would talk about this incident in the future.</p>\n<p>So Shira stood up and patted his trouser, admitted, “Ah, you’re right, Romana.”</p>\n<p>Mila crossed her arms. Frowning at her cousin. “What are you gonna do now? Fight them? No need to be afraid, I’m with you.”</p>\n<p>Snake, still squatting comfortably, added, “Young Master, my grandfather and my older brother are still here too. You won’t be at a disadvantage in case things go downhill.”</p>\n<p>“It’s decided. Let’s kick their asses!” Mila growled.</p>\n<p>“The heck are you talking about kicking people’s asses in Ngajen Ceremony?” Shira grunted.</p>\n<p>“Then at least let me slap that slut’s arrogant face!”</p>\n<p>Shira shook his head.</p>\n<p>“Let’s go,” he said.</p>\n<p>“We’re gonna slap her face now?” Mila asked.</p>\n<p>“No. We at least have to make Family Yashura’s presence known here,” Shira said. He caught his companions’ confused expressions, so he added, “Everyone is getting excited because most of them are young'uns. But if this incident gets out of the hands, the elders from other families won’t be silent about it.”</p>\n<p>Mila wanted to say something but didn’t after seeing Shira’s relaxed face. She didn’t want to say something silly that’d change the boy’s mind. Therefore, with Shira leading the way, she and her friend Romana went to see the ruckus caused by the noble’s arrival. Leaving Monkey and Sneak who were silent looking at their back.</p>\n<p>The two exchanged glances.</p>\n<p>They looked down, eyes sweeping the ground.</p>\n<p>“Mm?” Monkey mumbled, his hands crawling all over the dirt.</p>\n<p>Snake took out a magic wand. The wand shimmered with a gentle light, then he used that to give some light to the ground where the rendang was spoiled.</p>\n<p>But it was Monkey who shouted in joy, “I got one!”</p>\n<p>“Give me that!” Snake pounced the moment he saw Monkey rubbed the dirt of a piece of rendang.</p>\n<p>Pushing out Snake’s face from grabbing the rendang in his hand, Monkey felt wronged and cried, “Why would a rich gentleman like you fight over a single beef with this poor peddler? Don’t you know my family can only afford to eat beef once a year?”</p>\n<p>“Why, you asked?” Snake sneered, “There’s no need to say the obvious. You don’t get to eat Patriarch Shuro’s handmade rendang everyday! And I’m saying this after starving for beef ever since I’m following you.”</p>\n<p>“Fuck off!”</p>\n<p>“Give me that!”</p>\n<p>“No!”</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the shadowy corner where they were wrestling came to be lightened up with a lit torch.</p>\n<p>“Ehem, you two gentlemen,” a voice called.</p>\n<p>For a moment, Monkey and Snake stopped fighting.</p>\n<p>The voice owner was a man with Malikh Family’s servant uniform. Reluctantly, he continued, “Badril Village locals are usually open-minded and tolerant people. However, we have a bottom line. If you two couldn’t hold it you should rent some inn room or do it in the bushes! Don’t do it in the open, you’re making people uncomfortable! Know some shame!”</p>\n<p>Monkey at first didn’t get what the servant was talking about. Then he realized during infighting over the rendang, he had opened his legs, and Snake was on top of him in a very, very awkward manner.</p>\n<p>“Dammit!” he kicked Snake and trembling over the horror he caught himself in. But suddenly he noticed the rendang in his hand already vanished. He whirled his head around. Snake was already licking his fingers with a satisfied face.</p>\n<p>“Dammit!” Monkey howled again.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The one who enthusiastically greeted the young noble of Blackwood Family was Elder Jhamil instead of Bhela Malikh. He managed to conjure thirty years worth of bullshitting skills to flatter and fawn over the other party, rather thick faced to continue despite the young master of noble family rolled his eyes several times. As soon as the young noble caught the sight of a short-haired girl he immediately escaped from Elder Jhamil’s clutch with a big grin on his face.</p>\n<p>“Ah, Sister Bhela!”</p>\n<p>“Young Master Frane Blackwood.”</p>\n<p>“How are you doing Young Lady Bhela? Fancy to meet you again,” he said as he gifted the girl a flower.</p>\n<p>Bhela received the flower but then immediately passed it to a random maidservant beside her. She said as if it was nothing, “I’m fine. Thank you.”</p>\n<p>Young Master Frane Blackwood smiled wryly. “I’ve been travelling with hardly any rest so that I can see you sooner, my young lady,” the young master of Blackwood Family, Frane Blackwood, said, “may I be so lucky to receive your company tonight?”</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry, but here the words ‘tonight’s companion’ have different meanings than when you say it in the western-style ball--so, no, Young Master Blackwood, I can’t give you company tonight,” she said.</p>\n<p>The young noble still had a smile and wanted to correct his wording, but Bhela suddenly raised her hand and said, “Excuse me.”</p>\n<p>She went past him and greeted another pair of guests instead.</p>\n<p>“Greeting, sir, madam.”</p>\n<p>“It’s about time,” the middle-aged man didn’t answer Bhela’s greeting, but complained instead. “You know the other families had begun their ceremonies, right? Even though we don’t have the same ceremony as your Ngajen Ceremony from the place where I come from, but I know those who don’t take any old ceremonies seriously only brought bad luck over their lands.”</p>\n<p>There was a rare restraint in Bhela’s voice as she replied, “I apologize for our bad conduct, Sir Instructor. I will request the elders to proceed with the ceremony. Please let me lead you toward the reserved spot I previously prepared for both of you.”</p>\n<p>“Lead the way then.”</p>\n<p>Badril Village locals witnessed the valiant Young Lady of Malikh Family taking charge of the Ngajen Ceremony as the Chief Chef, but with the appearance of her bowing to two unfamiliar guests as well, whispers were floating amongst the Ngajen Ceremony guests. Before long, everyone knew that two guests Bhela Malikh greeted were the ones she personally invited, but was neglected before the family’s gate because of the excitement made by the noble’s arrival. Bhela came to them to apologize in person.</p>\n<p>Young Master Frane Blackwood, who felt ignored, pulled a self-decrepitating sneer. He complained to Elder Jhamil instead, “Oh, Malikh Family elder, can you tell me the identity of those two guests who made even Young Lady Bhela to bow her head?”</p>\n<p>“Ehem, ehem,” Elder Jhamil didn’t know what to answer, so he concocted a reply out of thin air, “I think they were relatives from her maternal family.”</p>\n<p>“Is that so? From the way they are dressed, they don’t look from that respectable background enough to get the young lady’s full attention. Don’t you think so?”</p>\n<p>“Young noble is right. Young Lady Bhela’s father once was a gangster thus he didn’t manage to teach common sense to the young lady. I’ll talk to her later to explain what’s really important.”</p>\n<p>After a bit of excuse and fawning, Young Master Blackwood felt this Elder Jhamil was acceptable. He told the Blackwood Family’s servants to bring the gifts he had prepared, which were naturally accepted by Elder Jhamil on the young lady’s behalf. In the meantime, people were disappointed that the drama they were expecting didn’t happen. But what could they do besides shaking their heads and disperse?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Year after year, the ngajen ceremony evolved from stiff sessions of praying ceremony for village safety to the new stylish festivities of foods and happy times for the youngsters, where fads and trends emerge. However big their way of life was changing the conservative major families, Yashura and Elzhier, still pretty much followed the old ways, especially when it came to the prayers. Only Malikh Family amongst the three that eager to embrace the new world that was coming. And by Elder Jhamil’s direction, instead of local shamans, Malikh Family asked help from foreign priests from western orthodox temples from nearby villages to lead the prayer.</p>\n<p>It was all good if one made a progressive decision with the greater good in mind. But here was the problem; orthodox temple priests usually led prayers for abundant harvest, while Ngajen Ceremony was all about calming Selaqs from descending the mountain. These priests probably hadn’t any clue how Selaqs looked like.</p>\n<p>“It was inappropriate for a noble to pray to old Mossack deities they don’t believe in, that was Malikhs’ excuses,'' Mila complained non-stop since they finished praying with other guests. In her hands--like a young mother hugging her baby--were plates of food she had just plundered from Malikh Family’s banquet tables prepared to entertain guests.</p>\n<p>“What deity? Wasn’t the mantra replaced from ancient Mossack prayers to magic spell mantra to calm down Selaq since… I don’t know, fifty years ago?” Romana said. The food in her hands was no less than Mila’s. These two girls seemed to think Malikh Family would regret offending them if they plunder the latter’s prepared feast like no tomorrow.</p>\n<p>“That's what I was saying! We no longer those ancient Mossacks who would sacrifice relatives so Selaqs won’t come down the mountain! Nowadays we’ve been using legit spells to keep all those Selaqs away, and these stupid Malikhs want to change the tradition just to appease some visiting noble? They’d rather avoid their noble guest to be uncomfortable than preventing Selaqs from coming down to chew their stupid brains, hah!”</p>\n<p>Compared to noisy girls beside him, Shira was able to keep his head to his feet. Romana signaled Mila with her eyes when she realized the boy wasn’t so into retaliating against the Malikhs; instead of invading the feast Shira, grabbed Malikh Family’s snacks moderately whenever he could--just like any other normal guests that came here.</p>\n<p>Mila grumbled with a bad mood, faced Shira and said, “Don’t you have something you need to do?”</p>\n<p>“Like what?” Shira hoped this cheeky cousin of his wouldn’t say something about kicking people’s asses again.</p>\n<p>“We can’t wait for something to happen,” she said. “Go ask that bitc--I mean, that fiancée of yours--go ask for a dance. The young’uns are starting to get heated. Look there, one of them couples are dancing. You go join them since that short-haired cunt is your fiancée after all.”</p>\n<p>Mila glanced around for a while before she realized she just had her tongue slipped. She quickly corrected her previous words, “Did I say cunt? I mean short-haired bitch--no, short-haired <em>young lady</em>.”</p>\n<p>“Why don’t you just be honest with yourself here. People have been calling Malikhs much worse here because the foreign priests matter!” Romana laughed.</p>\n<p>At that moment a very young maidservant of Malikh Family just passed by and overheard their conversation. The little maidservant snorted in anger, which made Mila snorted back as a retort.</p>\n<p>“Go, go! Go dance with her!” Mila whispered when she was sure only Shira and Romana were around.</p>\n<p>Shira clicked his tongue. “I don’t even have a single proper conversation with her these past ten years. Why should I go ask her dance out of the blue? Just showing our face around here is enough.”</p>\n<p>“Fool! If she accepted to dance with you then all is good, that would only confirm Malikh Family’s cocky attitude is only because their dipshit brains are getting fried by their own inflated proud ego, nothing serious! But if she ignores you in front of others… heh--she dares!”</p>\n<p>“That’s easy for you to say. If someone you don’t like suddenly asks your hands for a dance, what would you feel later on when you found out refusing means two families become enemies?”</p>\n<p>“Uh-uh, I don’t feel nothing. If he’s my fiancé then it’s my job to go my way out to make it clear in public! Going dancing, going kissing, like a proper damned couple! That’s what the goddamn engagement is all about! Right?”</p>\n<p>Mila ate a cookie and she blinked. Unsure of the previous words she said, she glanced at Romana and murmured, “...right?”</p>\n<p>Romana shrugged.</p>\n<p>But Shira wouldn’t back down easily. He continued arguing, “What if your fiancé is Bony Elzhier, then? Are you going to kiss him to prove he’s your fiancé?”</p>\n<p>Mila hid her gasp.</p>\n<p>“You wanna die?” she pursed her lips. “Listen to me or I’m gonna smack your face!”</p>\n<p>Shira groaned against his cousin’s unreasonableness. But before he could concoct a satisfying retort, Snake and Monkey came out of nowhere.</p>\n<p>“Oh, Young Master Shira,” Monkey came patting him on the shoulder, “it seems you get cuckolded for real this time.”</p>\n<p>People were clapping and whistling as the flashy Young Master Frane Blackwood led Young Lady Bhela Malikh by the hand.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Malikh was entertaining two guests previously, but that bald elder raised a fuss about how she neglected the young noble, so in the end it came to this.”</p>\n<p>Monkey laughed as he teased Shira with his elbow, “They’re going to dance. When two people were dancing in Ngajen Ceremony, that meant they--” he caught the scary experssion on Mila’s face, stopped, “nevermind…”</p>\n<p>“That slut!” Mila hissed.</p>\n<p>This was getting serious. Whenever Mila showed that kind of face something bad would happen. Again, the moment Shira opened his mouth to say something, someone else came to grab him in the shoulder.</p>\n<p>“Brat, your woman is going to cuckold you in public,” said the newcomer, Good-Natured Spirit, who literally came out of the thin air.</p>\n<p>“You too?”</p>\n<p>Shira had a headache. Both Monkey and Snake couldn’t see the annoying Good-Natured Spirit, but the three of them were in harmony in mocking him. They mocked him to the point saying he wouldn’t care would only embarrass him further.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, being led by the hand, Bhela Malikh asked Young Master Blackwood, “What kind of remedy Blackwood Family brought with you?”</p>\n<p>“Why so much in hurry, my young lady?” the young noble gave a laugh and a flash of smile. “No need to worry, Blackwood Family sympathize with the disaster that befell your father, so my mother send me here to personally deliver the medicine Blackwood House had sought far and wide.”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh said nothing more. The Young Master of Blackwood Family pondered as he read the cold expression of the girl, thinking that even with flowers and jewelry gifts, nothing could move this young lady. Such a waste of that beautiful face to not letting a single smile escaped, Young Master Blackwood could only smacked his lips and shook his head. But as soon as he mentioned a medicine he brought for her father, the feisty young lady became amiable almost immediately.</p>\n<p>Good thing for him. Bhela Malikh was talented, the Blackwood Family planned to have her inside their house, and if things went this smoothly he could do that his mother told him sooner than he expected.</p>\n<p>“Little bitch of Malikh Family,” a girl roared, “you finally show your true color you bitch! Is Yashura Family a joke to you?!”</p>\n<p>The furious Mila Yashura became the center of attention. She snorted as she strode, like an angry bull preparing to charge, with the mood that would make the crowd wordlessly give way to her. Not only because they didn’t want anything to do with the infamous young lady of Yashura Family--who, when angry, once punched Bony in the face with a nosebleed--but also because she got a sword in her hands.</p>\n<p>Shira glanced down. His father’s sword he brought with him was gone. He looked again at the unsheated weapon in his cousin’s hands.</p>\n<p>He could only slap his own face the moment he noticed what was happened.</p>\n<p>Mila took a step forward slowly, but her face turned even fiercer. She spoke, “You got guts to bring a lover from outside, eh? I knew something fishy happened when I saw you cut your hair, you little slut.”</p>\n<p>“I cut my hair because it got in the way during my training,” Bhela replied plainly. “And this is not my lover. Just a relative of my friend.”</p>\n<p>“You lying little slut. As if someone like you have any friends!”</p>\n<p>“I do have a friend.” Bhela said. A rare emphasizing tone in her voice was telling that she was upset, but she held back from explaining further.</p>\n<p>“I don’t care what your excuse is! Do you think I don’t know what you shitty Malikhs up to? You already don’t put Yashura Family in your eyes, eh? Just because you bitch have a little vacation outside, eh? If you think you’re a big shot, why don’t you prove it here and now?!”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh was silent for a while. Looking at Mila, she then asked, “And what are you suggesting I should do, Young Lady Yashura?”</p>\n<p>Mila stabbed her sword into the ground.</p>\n<p>“I just want to know how awesome is this Archer class you’ve got overseas that makes you Malikhs stop putting us Yashuras in your eyes,” Mila sneered. “Why don’t we test it with my sword, eh? Let’s do a duel, bitch.”</p>\n<p>Bhela just looked at Mila strangely.</p>\n<p>“But you’re a Specialist class,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Aha! Getting scared, aren’t ya, you little cunt?”</p>\n<p>Bhela didn’t want to argue with her. So she told the nearest servant to go grab a bow.</p>\n<p>On the other side, Monkey anxiously elbowed Shira, said, “Should I drag your cousin back?”</p>\n<p>“Stand down, mister. Mila is the one who’s starting it. She can’t afford to back down now.”</p>\n<p>Beside them Snake was nodding as he understood what Shira meant.</p>\n<p>Then with a laugh, Good-Natured Spirit, who was already tired jeering him, said to Shira. “Kid, shit just got real. Ain’t that a good idea to pull her before it’s too late?”</p>\n<p>Shira wanted to but he couldn’t. He knew exactly Mila’s strength. Fighting bare hands, she might get a chance to stand against the strongest youngster in the village, but it would become a different story when weapons and mana were involved.</p>\n<p>Since Mila was the one to propose the duel, bailing out before the fight began would be slapping her own face in front of the guests. It was a bad idea, because Mila didn’t appear to have the slightest chance to win. So bad that it’d be more reasonable to just surrender. But Shira knew Mila hated to go back on her words the most. Thus he silently moved closer to her, prepared to pull her back in before the situation really got out of his hands.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Young Master Blackwood, was pulled out by an adjutant of his family.</p>\n<p>Smirking, he asked the adjutant, “Who is that girl who picking a fight with Bhela?”</p>\n<p>“Seems like the eldest young lady of that family,” the adjutant replied.</p>\n<p>“You mean the family my Bhela got engaged to?” Young Master Frane Blackwood asked as if Bhela already his. The corner of his lips curled as he thought this might be a good chance to do something on the engagement that Blackwood House already saw as a thorn in their eyes. “Do you have something on that girl?”</p>\n<p>“Replying to young master, since Yashura Family is the main obstacle for us to get Young Lady Bhela Malikh to our side, your mother has already sent someone to investigate them. The eldest young lady of Yashura Family merely a Level 10 Specialist class who just graduated from Novice about seven months ago.”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood couldn’t help but chuckle. Even though the two young ladies had the same level, a Specialist merely support class that wasn’t suited in combat. This duel affair would turn out to be a joke.</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood scoffed. “Let my Bhela teach her some manners. I don’t want anyone to disturb us after this.”</p>\n<p>“Young master,” the adjutant lowered his voice, “I don’t think that’s a good idea.”</p>\n<p>“What’s on your mind, adjutant?”</p>\n<p>“I just made a round to check the guests attending this ceremony, and I found…”--he lowered his voice--“...some spectators amongst the guests that shouldn’t have be here….”</p>\n<p>“Go on,” the young noble urged.</p>\n<p>“I just received the word, young master, there are experts that Elder Jhamil said he didn’t invite.”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood frowned. “What… what’s that supposed to mean?”</p>\n<p>On the less crowded place of the courtyard, the middle-aged man who Bhela greeted before, along with the middle-aged woman, watched the commotion unfold while nibbling on steamed peanuts. He glanced at the other place where a man calmly sipping tea, a man with a hard face who couldn’t hide his sharp aura, then swept his gaze at the one who beside him, a short stature man who wore a headband to hide his reddish hair from public, who also happened to enjoy steamed peanuts while his focus solely at one direction in the crowd.</p>\n<p>All of them came in common garments incognito. But still Elder Jhamil sent people to keep tabs on them, especially since the bald elder still didn’t know the reason Bhela Malikh invited these foreigners.</p>\n<p>The ngajen ceremony usually consisted of three main parts--prayer, socializing, and sending offerings to the mountain as the finale. It was uncommon for irrelevant events to happen between them. However, since the young lady of the host had already accepted the duel, Malikh Family set up an emergency venue for the fight.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil came to invite himself as the judge. For a change to hummiliate those simple Yashuras and to slip himself onto the spotlight, he couldn’t ask for better opportunity.</p>\n<p>“You two ready?” Elder Jhamil asked both of the opposing sides. “This is a friendly match between two friendly families. So stop before your blade hit your enemy,” he said, seemingly talking to either sides, but didn’t say anything about the arrows part.</p>\n<p>Since Bhela Malikh was an Archer, she suggested to Mila, “I’m using a bow. So you can move first. I’ll try to dodge for ten seconds.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t need that,” Mila scoffed.</p>\n<p>“Very well…” she said. She glanced at Elder Jhamil, said, “Elder Jhamil, please begin the duel.&quot;</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil counted to three.</p>\n<p>The duel began.</p>\n<p>“AAAAAA!!!” Mila roared with the sword raised above her head, charging ahead.</p>\n<p>Contrast to her opponent’s battle cry, Bhela was solemn. She picked four arrows from the quiver tied on her hips. Nocking the arrows simultaneously, she took a deep breath as she concentrated to channel different natures elemental mana from her manasphere. The mana, through fingers and her thumb, flowing into all the four arrows and soon the tip of the arrows glowed with four different colors.</p>\n<p>The wind began to stir.</p>\n<p>And she raised the bow. She released the arrows.</p>\n<p><em>Fuuush fuuuushhh fuuushh shhuuuuusshh!</em></p>\n<p>Before even everyone noticed what happened, the mana Bhela channeled melted the flying arrows, within a span of milliseconds, turning them into dangerous magic projectiles of four elemental natures--fire, water, wind and lightning.</p>\n<p>Mila was confident before. She knew a trick against an Archer, but here she was dumbfounded by magic arrows coming to blast her way. She thought she was fighting an Archer, but got up against a Mage instead. This wasn’t what she signed up for.</p>\n<p><em>Clank!</em></p>\n<p>The first blue arrow dissapeared almost the moment it reached Mila. The sound of metallic clash that followed the said arrow resounded three more times, and the three arrows left behind too disappeared almost immediately. Mila, thought she ought to dodge the magic arrows, leap a step backward, but her hasty movement combined with the slippery mud made her slipped her foothold, accidentally fell to her butt instead.</p>\n<p>Bhela aimed down her bow. Everyone was staring at her with complicated and questioning gaze, as an Archer who could do magic, this was the first time everyone witnessed it.</p>\n<p>“It’s a four elemental affinity spell!” someone’s voice roared through the silenced venue, “I heard it, I doubted it, but she really did it!”</p>\n<p>Everyone looked at his way, the man who shouted, and saw that it was the middle-aged man whom Bhela invited from outside the village. He sat eating steamed peanuts then, now he was standing perplexed.</p>\n<p>Bhela, realizing that the man was the center of the attention, and bow to him from afar.</p>\n<p>“She really did it…” the man said under his breath.</p>\n<p>Someone who sat beside him said, “Sure she did, the only one right now--I guess now that you big brain from Elemental Stone School witnessed it I guess you can die without regret?”</p>\n<p>The man looked at the woman who accompanied him, he said still with expression of disbelieve, “It’s a four elemental affinity spell…”</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, you already said that.”</p>\n<p>The last and the most famous multi elemental Unique Class was, a mage with three elemental affinity skills, died of old age--was actually the headmaster of Elemental Stone School from seventy years ago. As a scholar and a mage researching deeply in topics of elemental mana all of his career, how could he didn’t know the value of a Unique Class who surpassed even the ex-headmaster of his school?</p>\n<p>“I can’t believe someone without a Mage Unique Class really did it…”</p>\n<p>“The most promising talent of this generation, alright, the first time I witnessed an Archer could do magic,” the woman said. “Good thing she stopped her arrows then--if not, the other girl would ended up so pitiful.”</p>\n<p>As the woman said that, someone else blurted not far away from there.</p>\n<p>“She didn’t stop it.”</p>\n<p>“Pardon? Sir Kurusiya?” the woman asked.</p>\n<p>The one she was talking to was the quiet man with sharp aura. He said as a matter of fact like tone, “She didn’t stop it. Someone else did,” he sipped his tea, and when the woman still confused, he explained with hoarse voice, “those are magic, but they were still arrows shot from a bow. You can’t stop flying arrows. That girl calculated and slightly missed her aim as to not hurting her opponent. But she didn’t plan to stop it.”</p>\n<p>The woman questioned him, “If she wasn’t the one who stopped it, then would you know why the arrows disappears?”</p>\n<p>The man put down his glass of tea. “I don’t know. Why you ask me? Ask that fool there who’s been grinning all the time.”</p>\n<p>The woman, along with the middle-aged man from Stone Elemental School, looked up to the bearded foreigner.</p>\n<p>“She’s not the one who stopped it,” the bearded man said with a smile.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Mila, who mellowed from her defeat and still sat on the muddy ground, gulped as she saw her cousin come to pick her up.</p>\n<p>“I lost,” she said to Shira.</p>\n<p>“No you didn’t, that girl is the one who put down her bow first, and you still got your swords in your hands--so technically you’d win.”</p>\n<p>“I fell to my butt, I was humiliated,” Mila said, her voice trembled, “I lost….”</p>\n<p>Shira sighed. He grabbed Mila’s hand and pulled her up. “It’s adult problems from hereon, Uncle Shuro would likely summon my father back. For now, let’s get out of here,” he said.</p>\n<p>Monkey and Snake, along with the nervous Romana, came to follow them from behind to shield them from people’s laughter. Mila was so humiliated the usually feisty tomboy was so down she couldn’t afford to hold her head straight. As Shira witnessed how pitiful his cousin was, regret overwhelming him when he remembered how he was holding back from taking action himself.</p>\n<p>“Brat,” someone called him.</p>\n<p>Shira turned his head. It was Good-Natured Spirit.</p>\n<p>“You owe me this time,” the Nalaq said.</p>\n<p>Shira nodded.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>“Hear ye hear ye people! Gather around and hear me announce something incredible, people! Gather around, will ya!”</p>\n<p>Standing on top of a table, Elder Jhamil shouted to gather people, announcing something that the Young Master of Blackwood Family passed him beforehands. “Although winner of the duel is Young Lady Bhela, Young Master Frane of Blackwood House is concerned by some stupid unruly girl of the supposed biggest family in Badril Village behavior would smear my young lady--”</p>\n<p>“Big news! Big news!” someone else’s shouting cut off Elder Jhamil’s announcement, “Young Master Bonithon is running around beating people! Watch your mouth if you don’t want get beaten for no reason!”</p>\n<p>“Bony is going crazy! He’s going to kick people’s asses! Nobody knows why!”</p>\n<p>“What the fuck is going on! Why Elzhier Family messing with us Malikhs now?”</p>\n<p>At the chaotic scene before him, Elder Jhamil’s face showed a frown and a hint of hesitation. He then cleared his phlegm anyway, trying to get people’s attention, then pushed on announcing carefully, “Young Master Frane Blackwood is concerned that--”</p>\n<p>“Elder Jhamil!!” a servant came running with a horrified expression, “Bony is coming for you, run away!”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil pointed his finger at the servant and roared, “What is that brat from Elzhier Family wants to do with me! Go kick him out, I’m trying to tell everybody something important here!”</p>\n<p>“But he doesn’t listen to reasons! He’s going to punch your face, is what he said just now!”</p>\n<p>“Imbecile! Do you think a young master would jump around like a monkey and punch an elder of another family in the damn face?! He’s making ruckus. Go on, kick him out!”</p>\n<p>Looking at the crowd from the rushedly made stage, he then smiled and continued, “Right, everybody, it’s Young Master of Blackwood Family; what I’m saying is that since Young Lady Bhela Malikh is winning with ease against the foolish young lady of <em>that</em> family, Young Master Blackwood concerned that some people would shrug my young lady’s victory. So he proposed, in order to make it clear the disparity between Malikh and--sheesh--Yashura, he proposed that him as a friendly representative of Malikh Family and Shira Yashura as the repre--”</p>\n<p>“Elder Jhamil--watch out!”</p>\n<p>He had it taking from lowly servants who cut off his announcement. Fuming in anger, Elder Jhamil pointed his finger toward the one who was spriting toward him and roared, “How many times I told you to just kick him out! Shut your trap and go kick the damned brat!”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was losing his cool. But what he failed to realize in time was that the one who sprinted toward him wasn’t a servant from his family. It was not the one who telling him to run away. And before he knew it, someone leaped up on the table where he was standing and delivered a punch to the face.</p>\n<p>“Gaaahhh!”</p>\n<p>Even after Elder Jhamil stumbled down the table he stood on, his assaulter didn’t plan to let him go. And what came after that was a torrent of hardened fist, pummeling his face even though he screamed for mercy. Only when the chaotic crowd succeeded in saving him did Elder Jhamil see the assaulter’s face--it was indeed the Young Master from Elzhier Family.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Bonithon… what did you… why did you do this… for what reason?!” Elder Jhamil choked out his grievance.</p>\n<p>Bony, the man who beat the bald elder black and blue, replied with nothing but a cold stare. Instead, it was an almost incoherent voice of Pilek who answered instead.</p>\n<p>“Kekekek, don’t be angry Elder Baldy! We just discussed how you were a splendid Pugilist a long time ago, so Boss Bony came here to find out whether it was true or not! That’s why he asked you to a barehand duel!” Pilek came in with a swagger and a bottle of booze in his hand. From a single glance anybody could tell he was drunk.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s lips trembled. What duel? That brat just leaped out of nowhere without saying anything, then immediately beating him black and blue!</p>\n<p>The only one from the three delinquents who hadn’t had the smell of liquor from his body was Polio. He wore an apologetic smile, and with a slight sigh, he said, “Please forgive them, dear kind Malikh sirs, my friends are terrible when they are drunk.”</p>\n<p>Polio made a round to apologize to any Malikhs he saw. But the Malikh Family didn’t appreciate his gesture, receiving jeerings in return.</p>\n<p>Polio was a patient young man, but Pilek wasn’t. The drunk Pilek didn’t take their attitude kindly, randomly walking to a servant, said, “Hah? What the fuck are you staring me at, you no-name Malikh servant? Wanna die, eh? Huuuraah!!!”</p>\n<p><em>Shatter!</em></p>\n<p>Without a warning he swung the booze in his hand to a Malikh family servant. The man he attacked stumbled backward holding his bloodied head from the crash Pilek gave him.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Bhela Malikh had just settled greeting four foreign guests that she invited from outside, and was on her way to fetch cuisines from the kitchen to humor her guests, then she witnessed the chaotic brawl unfold with a crowdful of cheers and jeers mixed in between. Perhaps there were more than a dozen men involved, with the Malikhs servants, guards, common family members even an elder came along to surround Bony and his two underlings.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela…” a little maidservant with a crest of Elzhier Family in her uniform bowed to Bhela politely.</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at her. She returned the bow even though the other party clearly was a servant. “Miss Elzhier,” she spoke softly.</p>\n<p>“No need to be polite to this servant, Young Lady.”</p>\n<p>“I can’t be impolite to Sister Ryntia’s friends.”</p>\n<p>The Elzhier Family maidservant smiled. Since Bhela insisted, then she wouldn’t be bowing her head anymore.</p>\n<p>She said, “Eldest Young Lady sends me to ask for your forgiveness for her brother’s brashness, Young Lady Bhela.”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at the brawl that started in her family’s courtyard. This chaos would spell imperfect on tonight's Malikh Family’s Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>“There’s no need for that. Since I accepted Young Lady Mila Yashura’s duel then I somewhat anticipated Young Master Bonithon will follow suit to make trouble tonight. If anything, it is I the one who should apologize to Sister Ryntia because I couldn’t handle the situation well. Please tell her that I’ll try to maintain friendship between Malikh and Elzhier Family.”</p>\n<p>Still with the serene smile on her face, the Elzhier Family maidservant studied the expression on Bhela’s face. She spoke a moment after, “Then I’ll let Eldest Young Lady Elzhier knows by tomorrow.”</p>\n<p>“Thanks,” Bhela offered her gratitude with a bow.</p>\n<p>By this time, the brawl became anything but intensified, as men either from Elzhier Family or thugs that previously had dealings with Bony’s group came in to reinforce the Elzhier young master. Before the Malikhs could pressure the intruders with numbers, but then the completely overwhelmed by the new reinforcement.</p>\n<p>“Huurraaahh!” Pilek sent a Malikh man flying with his kick. “Where the fuck your previous cocky taunt? Cat got your tongue, eh?”</p>\n<p>The only unspoken rules in brawls were strictly no usage of mana and spell as well as no sharp objects to use as weapons. But when it was chaotic and nobody could watch everybody the sharpest mind with tricks the one who prevailed--this is why the likes of Pilek and his friend Polio who always struck in place people wouldn’t be willing the one who were taking the advantage in brawls. Even hunters and seasoned guards were no match against these naughty brats.</p>\n<p>For example, when Pilek’s punch was blocked by Elder Jhamil’s son, “You shitty brat, just wait till I deal with your father--kuukgghh!”</p>\n<p>And because no one was watching, Pilek used his knee to strike the cocky young elder in the balls.</p>\n<p>With a sad whimper from his trembling lips, Elder Jhamil’s son curled onto the ground holding his precious balls that Polio struck.</p>\n<p>Seeing that a family elder was mercilessly defeated, a few Malikhs came to avenge their young elder. By then, Pilek already had Polio watching over his back.</p>\n<p>At that point, no Malikhs could match them in hand-in-hand brawl.</p>\n<p>A stranger then casually walked in. Pilek stopped, looking at him, and amidst the chaotic scene it took a while for him to find out that the man was actually a foreigner--an eastern Kaya man. The man had a sheathed sword on his hips. But Pilek wasn’t afraid as long as he stick with the brawl rules to use only fighting unarmed.</p>\n<p>“Huurraaah!”</p>\n<p>Pilek threw a feint. Most simple Malikhs would fall for this. But the eastern Kaya man didn’t budge. Seemed to even anticipate it. With a movement too fast for Pilek to follow the man grabbed his wrist, flicked him and sent him into the air like it was nothing.</p>\n<p>It was only after Pilek rolled in the mud he realized what had happened.</p>\n<p>The man then glanced aside and walked toward Polio who in his own right was too engrossed with the brawl. With his left hand pushing Polio’s shoulder and the other hand grabbing his wrist, he flipped Polio just like he did Pilek beforehand.</p>\n<p>Pilek and a few others that the man previously flipped were amazed by how effortlessly the man disabling enthusiastic young men from fighting.</p>\n<p>The sword handle the man had was wrapped with cloth and its body too thin for regular blades. Those who noticed this would understand that the man wasn’t an ordinary Kaya. Polio was one of them.</p>\n<p>“A Samurai!” he exclaimed a moment after he got thrown onto the muddy ground.</p>\n<p>The Kaya man stopped, looking at him, then spoke with a displeased tone, “I am but a masterless ronin.”</p>\n<p>The man then continued walking toward a different direction.</p>\n<p>Bony was fighting with three men alone, so he couldn’t afford to look around. He didn’t realize the Kaya man at first, but when the man tried to grab the wild young master’s wrist, Bony reacted--he reacted by throwing a punch to the man’s face.</p>\n<p>The man slapped his flying fist from the side, tremendously muffled its momentum. Again, he tried to grab Bony’s wrist and his shoulder. Bony tried resisting but the man’s speed was too fast for him to compete.</p>\n<p>As the man prepared to flip him, Bony felt a faint gush of the wind from his legs. It didn’t take him a second to realize the man just putting his hand on his shoulder as a feint--his real target was to gently nudge his foot on rooting from the ground, which, if he’d focus his effort to get his shoulder free from the man’s grasp, a small window of opening that could be used by his opponent to disrupt his sense of balance. Thus Bony firmly stomped his feet to the ground instead. He grabbed the man’s sleeve to make his opponent not be able to easily throw like Pilek and Polio.</p>\n<p>Responding to Bony’s choice, the man curled the corner of his lips. Bony caught a hint of taunt when he staring the man in the eyes.</p>\n<p>“Kkuuuggghh!”</p>\n<p>Bony did succeed in preventing himself get flipped to the ground. But he got struck in the gut instead.</p>\n<p>The man didn’t let him go. The moment Bony stepping backward due to shock having stricken, the man was charging and got his wrist in the blink of the eyes--what happened afterward was Bony got his feet swept and he completely lost his ground, and got cheered by his friends as the last man who got thrown into the mud.</p>\n<p>Bony then sat there looking as the fight stopped; since someone took him down, more and less the Malikhs had won the brawl.</p>\n<p>“Aren’t you Thoqek’s son?” the Kaya man asked Bony.</p>\n<p>Bony wasn’t willing to open his mouth when his father’s name got mentioned.</p>\n<p>Receiving no answer, the man thus carelessly said, “Unexpectedly, you’ve got more guts than your father. Get up now, and stop making trouble in Ghalim Malikh’s home.”</p>\n<p>The young ruffians with Bony as the leader naturally wouldn’t be arrogant anymore since they had been defeated. They retreated calmly, and the Malikhs didn’t dare taunt them the second time in case Bony would change his mind and started on a rampage again. In the end, the real reason why Bony came targeting Malikh Family, as many people knew, was that he wasn’t a drinker that would lose reason to punch another family’s elder in the face.</p>\n<p>Speaking about an elder who got a punch in the face; after Bony and others were gone, Elder Jhamil showed his nose out of his hiding place. He gritted his teeth. He swore he’d use his full resource to get back from Bony’s father in the next village council meeting.</p>\n<p>“Elder Jhamil, you still haven’t announced the thing I ask you to do,” from behind, the sullen young noble Frane Blackwood said to him.</p>\n<p>“Y-young Master Blackwood, please spare me--the mood isn’t that good to draw people’s attention after that kid crashing our Ngajen Ceremony just now. How about I brief it to other village leaders tomorrow in the village council meeting?”</p>\n<p>“No, I want everyone to know it by tonight. This is the right time and the right place to announce it. Besides, I want to see what kind of a young man the one who’s supposed to be my rival.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil didn’t want to show his beaten face to the crowd tonight. But as much as he love his face he knew flattery wouldn’t get him out of this situation--at least not if he didn’t want to offend the young noble. And so with a heavy face he climbed the table once again, hiding off his reluctancy.</p>\n<p>Someone heartily made a joke on him, “Elder Jhamil, we thought you’re a man who care about face the most--I don’t expect you to boldly show how handsome you’ve become now!”</p>\n<p>“Kids nowadays getting big headed by their privileges as young masters--naturally I’ll let their fathers know how to discipline their brats!” Elder Jhamil coldly said. “Anyway, you all know that my Young Lady Bhela is a girl with talent and her future is boundless. Here in Malikh Family we’re not willing to throw our princess to cow’s dunk that is Yashura Family’s trash young master. And our friend Young Noble Frane Blackwood also thinks the same!”</p>\n<p>Such passionate speech, naturally people were cheering in anticipation of the next spectacle they thought they were going to witness.</p>\n<p>Getting the cue from Elder Jhamil, Frane Blackwood came forward with a swagger. “I speak this as a close friend of Young Lady Bhela Malikh. Someone with the name of Shira Yashura; if you think you’re worthy of her, do you dare to prove it by having a duel with me?!”</p>\n<p>The crowd was silent. They were waiting for the reply.</p>\n<p>Frane Blackwood swept the crowd with his eyes.</p>\n<p>Someone said to him the boy he challenged was utter trash. He was amused guessing how this trash would respond to his duel challenge, especially when Bhela Malikh had just completely defeated the cheeky young lady from his family.</p>\n<p>There were already murmurs spreading. People were also curious whether Shira was going to accept or run away from it.</p>\n<p>And then…</p>\n<p>“<em>Cough, cough…</em>” someone awkwardly stepped forward with a wry smile plastered on his face. People recognized his face, which looked like a monkey, and many of them had seen him together with Shira Yashura.</p>\n<p>He was Monkey. He said, “This young noble… about your proposed duel… I’m afraid Young Master Shira Yashura can’t answer it tonight.”</p>\n<p>Frane Blackwood laughed. “Why? He’s scared? His cousin challenged Young Lady Bhela to a duel for no apparent reason; don’t tell me we can do the same to them?”</p>\n<p>“No, it’s not that.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil pointed his finger at Monkey. “We all know Shira Yashura is a trash who can’t even advance to Level 4 Novice! Young Master Frane Blackwood is kind. Tonight, he’s going to give Shira one chance to admit that he’s unworthy of Young Lady Bhela Malikh to the crowd here. He does that, and there will be no need for Young Master Frane Blackwood to embarrass him by kicking his ass!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, but he can’t give you an answer tonight,” Monkey insisted.</p>\n<p>Now it was Elder Jhamil who laughed. “He’s really scared facing Young Master Frane right now?!”</p>\n<p>“No…”</p>\n<p>“Then why?”</p>\n<p>Monkey sighed.</p>\n<p>“Because he’s already gone home!”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was furious. The whole point he had to gather people even though his face had been beaten by Bony was to call out the boy and embarrass him in public, as per the young noble request. But the said person himself already went home, so Elder Jhamil standing on top of the table was for nothing.</p>\n<p>Immediately he ordered a servant to send the message to Yashura Family, while in between, cursing the fact that he didn’t get the chance to distract the guests from discussing the previous brawl. Sure enough, not only the people were talking about Bhela Malikh’s hidden Unique Class, they were also talking about Bony, and people he beat to pulp, especially Elder Jhamil. People no longer cared to gossip about Young Lady Mila Yashura who had been sent home defeated, but they laughed at someone present who had just his misfortune like Elder Jhamil instead.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil had lost his face in the end. Literally and metaphorically.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, with a solemn expression Monkey looked at his partner Snake who was enjoying the banquet and had amused himself watching the spectacle previously.</p>\n<p>Monkey said with a whisper, “Why the hell your family doesn’t show his face when they dumping shit to Young Master and Young Lady Yashura just now?!”</p>\n<p>Snake glanced at him lazily. “I don’t know. They said they were going to diagnose Patriarch Ghalim Malikh previously.”</p>\n<p>“Can’t you just fetch your brother instead? Didn’t you put your words to assure young master before this? What if he thinks we’re people who put our words lightly?”</p>\n<p>“The one who’s diagnosing the patriarch is my grandfather, my brother supposed to be free enough to be a busybody just now,” Snake said, displeased by Monkey’s tone accusing him of being unloyal to his own word.</p>\n<p>Actually, he also confused why his brother didn’t show his nose when Young Lady Mila recklessly brought a sword to challenge Bhela to a duel. From his understanding of his brother’s character and the relationship between his family and Yashura from what he knew told him that more or less his brother was going to back Yashura if the drama with Malikh Family intensified. But he didn’t. Snake would barge into Malikh Family’s doors to look for his grandfather if he knew it was going to be like this instead.</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-5/chapter-5-1":"<authors-note id=\"Radhy\" type=\"danger\">\n<p>I don’t recommend reading from here onwards because the chapter below is still from the previous draft, which is different from the previous 4 chapters. Further edits will be made that most likely makes this chapter quite different than the current one.</p>\n</authors-note>\n<p>In a certain hall in Malikh Family’s left wing complex, four people sat idly on the bamboo mats covered floor. They were being served local-specialty ginger drinks mixed with brown sugar with herbs to drink. There were also some roasted peanuts to chew. Despite they dressed humbly when attending the Ngajen Ceremony, three of them were elders with statuses, while one of them, the sword bearing Kaya man, wasn’t anyone to ignore either.</p>\n<p>Having knowing this, they still waiting for their host, Bhela Malikh, to wrap up the Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>“Still,” Madame Sylvia said after a sip of ginger drink, “I wouldn’t have expected the girl’s talent to be that rare when she approached my sect with the invitation. The top brass only interested of her being the top grade during the seminar thus sent me to check her out. How about you, Mister Harrington?”</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t expecting it either. I only interested when the report said she showed a potential of being two elemental-affinities Archer. Three already great, but with four elementals, chances she’ll get her name down in history books.”</p>\n<p>“That is what happen if she able to live long enough to develop her full potential,” the quiet man with sharp aura remarked. His face was thin, rough, and since he never liked to smile, he always looked like he meant business. The man was role model of eastern Kaya race ancient warriors--stand and sit in straight posture, humorless, and most importantly, always bringing the sharp, thin sword of katana on his hips.</p>\n<p>Madame Sylvia was interested on his remark. So she asked, “Oh, why you think of that, Sir Kurusiya?”</p>\n<p>The eastern man replied, “Because she tangled herself with Blackwood Family,” he paused. “If this Blackwood the same one from this Blackwood guy I know, then it’s definitely a bad news for her.”</p>\n<p>Mister Harrington from Elemental Stone School disagreed.</p>\n<p>“Since when our factions become soft?” he questioned. “We’re not that pitiful to handle some second-rate noble family. Honestly, I think that young man from that Blackwood Family such a pest. If Young Lady Bhela asks for my favor, I’ll handle him cleanly and thoroughly--right here, right now.”</p>\n<p>“I’m not talking about Blackwood Family, I’m talking about the creepy guy with Blackwood as his last name,” Sir Kurusiya said as he put down his ginger drink. He wasn’t happy, so Madame Sylvia signaled Mister Harrington that it best not to continue arguing with the scary eastern Kaya man.</p>\n<p>The hall suddenly turned quiet. Then, the fourth man was happily enjoyed his drink, out of the blue he blurted for his opinion that no one asked for. “That boy from Yashura Family is sure interesting…”</p>\n<p>Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia smiled wryly. Nobody said anything about Yashura Family up until now. The fourth man, Baront Staterwind, came from a very peculiar faction. Which actually had nothing to do with Bhela’s type of talent. Even when he had already came to Badril Village, none would think he accepted Bhela Malikh’s invitation just to scout her talent.</p>\n<p>The hall’s door was knocked. Bhela entered. She politely greeted the four respected guests before she sat down.</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry for the wait, dear elders. Malikh Family hasn’t prepared the best dishes for you during the ceremony, so I asked the best chef we have to cook special meals for you,” Bhela said, then she glanced at the door. “Please enter, aunty!”</p>\n<p>The moment she called, a middle-aged woman who helped Bhela in the kitchen before came with a line of maidservants, bringing freshly cooked dinner meals with them. It was better than what the Malikhs served for the guests before, even compared to the meals served for the family’s important guests cooked by Bhela as the chief chef.</p>\n<p>“I rather you serve me some alcohol,” the eastern Sir Kurusiya said to her.</p>\n<p>Bhela nodded at his request and asked the aunty to fetch the best alcohol she could find. Of course, the best person to get help was the elder who provided Bhela with the hall to host her guests. Bhela hoped the said elder already knew the importance of this meeting thus not being stingy with his alcohol collection.</p>\n<p>“Can we start now, young lady? I don’t have a good alcohol tolerance so I rather get this completed before us adults get to drink,” Madame Sylvia said.</p>\n<p>“We have delicious food here served, Madame Sylvia. To be honest, all the wait before is for the aunties preparing dinner for dear elders,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>But not of the adults believed her words easily.</p>\n<p>“Hoho, you seem so nervous, young lady. You might not look like it, but you seem about to cry,” Sir Baront Staterwind said.</p>\n<p>“Just state what you want from us, don’t waste anymore time,” Sir Kurusiya urged.</p>\n<p>Bhela lowered her head. With her lips tremblingly parted, she said, “As you might know, my father fell ill when I was overseas attending the seminar. My mother has contacted many doctors and alchemists to make medicines for him, yet my father’s condition never improved. I request for elders’ wisdom and strength, please help my poor father, he was in misery for months…”</p>\n<p>Bhela prostated.</p>\n<p>“Please, help me father… he’s dying… please…” she begged.</p>\n<p>Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia exchanged glances. The peculiar beardy man, Sir Baront, merely nodded without letting his thoughts known. Meanwhile, Sir Kurusiya, who didn’t bulge seeing the pretty girl begging in front of him, coldly said, “Well, this is really a waste of time.”</p>\n<p>Hearing the eastern man snorted, Bhela’s heart went cold. She prepared herself bowing down for help, without stating a single offer to prove how desperate herself.</p>\n<p>“And, young lady…” Madame Sylvia asked slowly, “what would you do if someone managed to heal your father?”</p>\n<p>Bhela rose up. She looked straight to Madam Sylvia’s gaze, then said, “Anything,”</p>\n<p>“Anything?”</p>\n<p>“Anything.”</p>\n<p>The room went quiet. Only Mister Harrington’s regretful sigh could be heard.</p>\n<p>It was Sir Baront Staterwind who explained with a good intention, “It really seems you haven’t grasped the situation you were in, young lady. The guest who gave you the gift from before, he’s a young master of a family known as the peerless medicine makers and doctors. If they couldn’t cure your father illness, then I believe no one in this room knows who really can.”</p>\n<p>“If I had a petty mind, young lady, I’d kill for the cosmetic you got from them. That’s how valuable their skills are,” Madam Sylvia said as she shook her head in pity.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh bit her lips. She was eloquent when she invited these experts months ago. Yet tonight, she had completely became tongue-tied and defeated. The cold air suddenly felt more unbearable. Although the warm meals’ delicious aroma wafted through the hall, not a single person had any incentive to touch their food. Everyone in the hall sunken into silence.</p>\n<p>“You want my advice, young lady?” the sharp voice of Sir Kurusiya sliced through the awkward atmosphere. He continued, “Having turned your back against Yashura Family is the dumbest decision you did. I didn’t come here because of you. I know your father, and I certainly know that swordsman from Yashura Family more. It’s a pity I couldn’t meet them today. Really, a complete waste miles and miles of journey.”</p>\n<p>With that, Sir Kurusiya, stood up and prepared to leave.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh quickly swallowed her bitterness, also stood up and said, “Please, Elder Kurusiya, let me see you the way out.”</p>\n<p>“No, don’t,” Sir Kurusiya flatly rejected her offer. “Sit down. These three fogies still haven’t decided what they want to do with you. Better think carefully about what you’re going to say to them next.”</p>\n<p>The eastern man saw himself out. Following his suggestion, Bhela Malikh sat down again and faced the three experts, with her mind suddenly became as blank as a barren field in the corner of abandoned land. She didn’t know what she ought to say to them, seeing the looks of pity they directed at her. Then, just when she managed to regain her bravery to say something, the door slammed open--</p>\n<p>“I come as the representative of Blackwood Family!” Young Master Frane Blackwood boldly yelled.</p>\n<p>He swagered himself in along with Elder Jhamil’s son and the adjutant of Blackwood Family under his wings. The arrogant behaviour of this young noble completely disregard the experts in the room. Madame Sylvia had enough. She dissed him, “What are you doing here uninvited?”</p>\n<p>Instead of the adjutant who usually spoke for his young master, it was the young elder of Malikh Family, Elder Jhamil’s son who replying. “This madam has eyes but doesn’t know what good for her. Of course Young Master Blackwood is invited! He’s the special guest of Malikh Family after all!”</p>\n<p>“What’s your name, boy?” the middle-aged woman hissed.</p>\n<p>“I’m Elder Jhamil’s eldest son! What’s up with you, you don’t have the right to know my name!”</p>\n<p>“Is that it? Very well. It seems just because I respect the southerner custom by dressing commonly you ignorant people already forgot what's best for you. Very well!”</p>\n<p><em>Zziiing!</em></p>\n<p>With a flashing draw of metallic sword, Madame Sylvia stood up to give this ignorant young elder a lesson. But her companion Mister Harrington quickly pulled her back before things really blown up.</p>\n<p>“You brought a weapon with you!” the Elder Jhamil’s son screamed with his finger pointing at Madame Sylvia who already trembling holding back her fury. “Do you not know what’s gonna happen to guests who bring weapons inside their host’s home?”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood rolled his eyes and told his adjutant, “Send this toad out of here, he’s too noisy!”</p>\n<p>“Right away,” the adjutant said. Then with his bony hands, he pulled the screaming Elder Jhamil’s son forcefully.</p>\n<p>“Is the discussion still ongoing?” Frane Blackwood asked the sitting guests as he tightened the blue necktie he wore. He said to Bhela, “Blackwood Family offers a lifetime terms of benefit for you, young lady. Not only medicines, if it boost potion you ask, or equipments, magic items, weapons--you name it, we have all things you’d dare to imagine!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho,” his uninvited offer gave Sir Baront Staterwind a chuckle. The three guests Bhela invited hailed from their own factions, so even if they wanted to rope Bhela in, they would consult with their higher ups about the specific terms they’d give to her as benefits. However, Blackwood Family was, in fact, only a noble family, not an organizational faction, with the only way in was through marriage--so of course the young noble would be able to offer a “lifetime benefits” to her so brazenly.</p>\n<p>“Thank you for holding back your anger, Madame Sylvia,” Bhela completely bowed her head to the angry guest while she completely disregarded Young Master Blackwood’s offers.</p>\n<p>Madame Sylvia nodded. She then looked at Young Master Blackwood and snorted. “Young lady, think carefully about what we said before. Some incapable people only able to spout honey trap to get what they want. Don’t be foolish because your father’s situation.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you for the advice…”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood wanted to argue with this lady. But he also held himself back as he didn’t know the other party’s identity. Therefore, all he could do was haughtily smiling elegantly as a proper noble as he was.</p>\n<p>“Has the discussion already started?” Frane Blackwood asked again. Pity him, not even one interested in answering. Because of that his face became red as he fumed with anger.</p>\n<p>“Ah,” Sir Baront Staterwind looked outside the window and slapped his thigh, “look how late it is! I planned to sleep early because I have something I need to do tomorrow early in the morning!”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh quickly offered to see him till the gate.</p>\n<p>“Hoho, how about you two?” Sir Baront asked the last two foreign experts, the pair of middle-aged man and woman, “overstaying your visit is considering a burden to these good Mossack folks, don’t you think so?”</p>\n<p>“I’m but an ignorant western lady, I know little about the way of the southern people, so please don’t mind us being shameless,” Madame Sylvia said. She then looked at Bhela, “Young Lady Bhela, Mister Harrington and I apparently haven’t booked our place in the village’s inns. We don’t know our talks would turned out dragged this late. For this I have to beg you to let us stay in Malikh Family for a few good days.”</p>\n<p>“Hoho…” Sir Baront Staterwind chuckled as he looked at the poker face pair of experts. Wasn’t the four of them--including Sir Kurusiya, checked in the same inn this afternoon? It was clear Madame Sylvia and Mister Harrington had their own intentions, thus Sir Baront Staterwind shrugged the idea of exposing their little white lies.</p>\n<p>And with that, Bhela Malikh led the three expert guests she invited out of the room. Young Master Blackwood, who was ignored so hard she almost exploded, yelling, “Young Lady Bhela!”</p>\n<p>Bhela turned around. “Yes, Young Master Blackwood?”</p>\n<p>“How about me?”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh blinked. Then she picked a bowl of roasted peanuts and approached him, saying softly, “Please sit down and enjoy this snack. I need to attend to my guests.”</p>\n<p>Hearing her soft, yet slightly cold voice, Young Lady Blackwood the understood something that made him excited, so excited he obediently sat down and nimbled on the roasted peanuts the beautiful Young Lady Bhela gave him.</p>\n<p>Then after Bhela brought the guests out, the Blackwood Family adjutant who was waiting outside came in inside the hall.</p>\n<p>“What are you doing?!” Young Master Blackwood hissed.</p>\n<p>The adjutant gawked. “Young master, I’m here to serve you…”</p>\n<p>“Serve me?” the young master cringed. What a joke! Soon he’d have a time being alone with Young Lady Bhela, and this old man wanted to be here right when he had the chance of his lifetime? What if there--during the discussion--was an accident where he had to be responsible as a man? Would he be happy if the adjutant was here when that happened?</p>\n<p>Absolutely not!</p>\n<p>“Get out! Don’t dawdle around here tonight! I need to discuss an important manner with Young Lady Bhela secretly!”</p>\n<p>“Y-young master--”</p>\n<p>“What are you waiting for! Go back to the inn and don’t bother me till the next morning!”</p>\n<p>The adjutant naturally understood what was inside the young master’s mind. He didn’t dare to linger around. With careful steps, he closed the door and went back to the inn Blackwood Family checked in.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Young Master Blackwood was so excited he couldn’t sit calmly alone in the hall. The thought of having private discussion with a girl as pretty as Bhela Malikh made him thinking a lot of things. Slowly, he getting horny.</p>\n<p>“What is taking her so long?” he mumbled to himself after waiting a fruitless thirty minutes. “Is it maybe she needs to… prepare, herself?”</p>\n<p>If it was going to be her first time, of course she needed time to prepare herself, Young Master Blackwood thought. This young noble had “befriend” and participating in “private discussions” with many experienced women. But virgin girls, he never tasted any.</p>\n<p>Because of that, he willing to wait however much longer for the young lady to prepare herself. And thus, after waiting for another thirty minutes, nothing happened. Nothing happened for the next hour as well. Then, after waiting for nearly three hours alone, the door finally opened…</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela, you finally ready!” Young Master Blackwood snapped out of his sleepy face and excitedly came to greet the visitor. Much to his disappointment, the visitor turned out to be the faithful adjutant.</p>\n<p>“Why is that you?!” Young Master Blackwood roared.</p>\n<p>“Y-young master… let’s get back to the inn,” the adjutant nervously asked.</p>\n<p>“Where’s Young Lady Bhela?”</p>\n<p>“She is in her room…”</p>\n<p>“Then you send someone there to ask her when she’s going to meet me,” the young noble ordered.</p>\n<p>“I’m afraid I can’t… young master…”</p>\n<p>“I’ve been waiting for hours, why?”</p>\n<p>The adjutant gulped before he replied.</p>\n<p>“Because the young lady has already gone sleeping since three hours ago!”</p>\n<p>So much for his dreamy private discussion! Young Master Blackwood was so angry for being misled that he slapped the adjutant’s face all the way back to his inn.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A single torch on a stick stubbornly lit the corner of the village in spite of the strong wind. A howling wolf in the distance reinforced the lone, cold sense of the midnight Badril Village. The only shop that still open at this hours could be counted with one hand, and this liquor shop was one of them. No customer visited it except a foreign eastern Kaya man.</p>\n<p>A series of step could be heard. The sleepy shopkeeper snapped back when he heard a new customer approaching.</p>\n<p>“Give me a glass of <em>tuak</em>, shopkeeper,” the new customer ordered with a booming voice. One could see his beardy feature when his face exposed to the shop’s lantern light. “Mind if I join you, Sir Kurusiya?”</p>\n<p>The eastern man didn’t reply. He drank his alcohol instead.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront Staterwind laughed by his cold treatment. The beardy guy was an easygoing person, so he casually grabbed a bowl of steamed peanuts and started to nibble on those snacks.</p>\n<p>“You’re not visiting Bhela’s father? You said you know him, you know, saying hi to a sick old buddy?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t say hi to a dying man,” Sir Kurusiya said.</p>\n<p>The answer made the air awkward. So Sir Baront quickly came with another topic.</p>\n<p>“It seems those two lovers adamant to protect the girl,” he said, referring to the other two experts who once were couple before Mister Harrington lost Madame Sylvia to another guy. “Or I think they just want some privacy to have some little reunion… who knows?”</p>\n<p>Sir Kurusiya never bothered with petty gossip, he callously replied, “They don’t know Malikh Family. They can’t protect her forever.”</p>\n<p>“Exactly,” Sir Baront Staterwind agreed. After that both men continued drinking without saying anything.</p>\n<p>“Hey shopkeeper,” Sir Baront called, “don’t you have anything with less alcohol? I have a business I’d like to deal with tomorrow, so I want to avoid shitty hangover.”</p>\n<p>“I have some sweet <em>tuak</em>,” the shopkeeper poured a new bottle into Sir Baront’s empty glass, “this one usually for them boys who haven’t gone coming of age ceremony. No alcohol, costs as little as four copper kobe coins.”</p>\n<p>“Four coppers, ah! Why’s that the souther I go the cheaper the drink?” he sipped it, “mm! Pretty good, my good man!”</p>\n<p>He tipped the shopkeeper with a silver coin. The shopkeeper was dumbfounded but quickly recovered and hid the coin safely.</p>\n<p>Sir Kurusiya said to Sir Baront, “You want to go to Yashura Family tomorrow?”</p>\n<p>“How did you know?”</p>\n<p>“Even though I can’t see him, I know the one who repelled Bhela’s arrow was a Nalaq,” Sir Kurusiya said.</p>\n<p>“Hoho, since I managed to rope in the young lady of Yurin Family, I’ve got promoted to an instructor,” Sir Baront smiled widely. “Doing the legwork isn’t my job anymore… but checking him and the boy won’t hurt, so I’m going. Hmm, I wonder if the Nalaq has already form his contract?”</p>\n<p>“Huuh…” the shopkeeper, who had been hearing their chatting, couldn’t help but asked, “you good sir, what’s this talking about a Nalaq having to do with Yashura Family?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, you’re a Yashura?” Sir Baront asked.</p>\n<p>“I’m Elzhier, from the outer family,” the shopkeeper said. “I’ve been in this village for forty years, but never I’ve heard any Nalaq passing by.”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, that’s why I’m going. Usually a rogue Nalaq isn’t someone tied with a faction, so they aren’t that big of deal--which also make them easier to rope in!”</p>\n<p>“Ooohh! Are you a Nalaq expert, mister? From overseas? Our family’s eldest young lady actually was scouted by a passing expert from overseas too, an expert from purple something sect!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, you mean Purple Garden Sect?” Sir Baront Staterwind and asked as he played along.</p>\n<p>But Sir Kurusiya was sceptic. “Purple Garden Sect is too far. And someone from that kind of superpower faction won’t be too idle to accidentally passing by on this kind of rural village.”</p>\n<p>Sir Baront nodded at Sir Kurusiya’s logic. Even if it was that particular sect that accepted the said young lady, both experts wouldn’t be too sure about whether she could be the sect’s legitimate disciple. Their doubts made the shopkeeper embarrassed. Since ten years ago, the tales of the eldest young lady of Elzhier Family being accepted by a foreign expert was a legend amongst Badril Village locals. Except her and the recent Malikh Family’s young lady, no one in the village was lucky got scouted to study oversea, so it became a fact that Elzhier Family was very proud of--and was one of the reasons why the Elzhier could win the village head’s seat from Yashura Family after their decades of leading Badril Village. But the problem was, in the letters their young lady sent home, she always talked about shops, fashions, and some other trivial stuffs that usually young women her age excited about. That made even her father, the current Elzhier Family’s patriarch and the Village Head, felt it was became difficult to still boasting the young lady’s status after ten years of her spending overseas.</p>\n<p>“But still, experts, you might not know this, but our eldest young lady was Young Lady of Malikh Family’s closest childhood friend! When Young Lady Bhela Malikh only a little girl our young lady gave her a lot of pointers and knowledge, so much that I assure that if it wasn’t for her being there for Young Lady Bhela, the Malikh Family wouldn’t get their talented Unique Class for at least the next one hundred years!”</p>\n<p>“Right…” Sir Baront became awkward instantly. To think some ignorant folks believed blessing of Unique Classes was that simple, even Sir Kurusiya scoffed at the idea.</p>\n<p>The shopkeeper’s face became red as he realized it was wise not to delay any longer. So he quickly said, “If you have some spare time, sir experts, I’m sure our Elzhier Family willing to entertain you!”</p>\n<p>After paying for their drinks, even the agreeable Sir Baront Staterwind felt it was very awkward for him to return to this little shop. Both decided not to get themselves involved with Elzhier Family after the shopkeeper’s little salesman talks, whilst not knowing the inn they stayed inn owned by Elzhier Family.</p>\n<p>On the way back, Sir Baront asked Sir Kurusiya for advice.</p>\n<p>“Yo, Kurusiya, I’m going to accept the Yashura boy as my third disciple if the Nalaq’s pretty good. But, you know, the Nalaq who contracted with youngest disciple is a master thirteen thousands years ago. She was a heavy weight figure, so I reckon I’ll let her calls the shot. What’s your opinion on this?”</p>\n<p>“How powerful is this Nalaq you’re talking about?”</p>\n<p>Sir Baront grinned. “You know the legend about Seven Pillars of Tiramikal Continent? She’s the Frost Mage mentioned in that history. Pretty neat, huh? She was able to revive as Nalaq and regained her consciousness five years ago. All the big shots in my Blue Robe Society can’t wait for the girl she’s contracted with to formally accepted into our faction.”</p>\n<p>“If that’s the case then your disciple isn’t necesserily worse than Malikh’s four elemental Archer girl.”</p>\n<p>“So you know why I can’t accept the boy if he’s too crude--I can’t afford to offend this madam Nalaq even the slightest bit.” he took out a bag of roasted peanuts he bought from the shopkeeper, and started to nibble on them. “I’m going to write a letter to my disciples, they’ve been playing around in the neighboring village. This madam Nalaq will come and check the boy herself.”</p>\n<p>Sir Kurusiya abruptly stopped his steps.</p>\n<p>“You want my advice?” he looked straight at Sir Baront’s eyes. “My advice is simple. You’re going to make this madam Nalaq of yours polite and you’re going to beg her to be mindful of her attitude in front of Yashura Family.”</p>\n<p>“You’re joking? You serious?”</p>\n<p>“I’m always serious,” Sir Kurusiya said.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Patriarch of Yashura Family, Shuro Yashura, was exhilarated to see Grandpa Piss and Snotty came to visit the village. One part because he treasured the friendships between their family and Grandpa Piss’s relatives, but mainly, he got to show-off his latest coconut cake recipe.</p>\n<p>“Ah, this is life, drinking <em>tuak</em> when we’re watching the moon, getting drunk while we’re eating coconuts. What a life!” Patriarch Shuro mumbled.</p>\n<p>“What a life indeed,” Grandpa Piss nodded with a low chuckle. On the sky, the full moon was shining bright really beautiful.</p>\n<p>After he’d done his part in ngajen ceremony, Patriarch Shuro Yashura accompanied the old Alchemist and his grandson in a spacious veranda, where they ate coconut cakes and drinking _tuak _while spending time moongazing. They had the Yashura Family’s sole butler, Yulong, to hold the _tuak _bottle and refilled their cups when empty.</p>\n<p>“Grandpa Piss, why didn’t you tell us beforehand before you visit Badril Village? We ran out of <em>rendang</em> before even the ceremony ended, so I’m sorry if you couldn’t eat <em>rendang</em>!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, we already ate chicken curry in Malikh Family, you don’t have to prepare food for us,” Grandpa Piss said.</p>\n<p>“How about breakfast? Are we still have leftover chickens, Yulong?”</p>\n<p>“We still have some leftover grilled village chicken, I’ll talk with the kitchen to reheat two portion first thing in the morning,” Yulong said.</p>\n<p>The Yashura Family’s patriarch was a role model of the stereotype Mossack people. He loved to cook and loved even more to feed people. It was no wonder why southern Mossacks’ visitors always felt welcomed whenever they visited the southern lands.</p>\n<p>“I sent them to bring <em>rendang</em> to Malikh Family, I never expected something like that to happen, hah!” Patriarch Shuro shook his head with a weak smile plastered on his face. During their talk, Grandpa Piss mentioned they met with Shira and Mila, as well mentioned the duel that happened between the two families’ young ladies and the upcoming duel between Shira and the young noble from Blackwood Family. “Whatever, if jerks wanted to fight with us, we won’t back down. Yashura Family never a coward!”</p>\n<p>“I believe Young Master Shira knows what he has to do,” Grandpa Piss assured.</p>\n<p>“I hope so, pity his father never around to hold the sky falling for him,” Patriarch Shuro gulped his <em>tuak</em>. “Anyway, let’s talk about something else. That Ghalim, you checked on him, Grandpa? What’s happened to him?”</p>\n<p>Snotty a little scared when Shuro Yashura suddenly brought up that topic. Snotty glanced at Butler Yulong’s wrinkled face, Yulong smiled back at him. The big muscle man couldn’t help but shuddered inside.</p>\n<p>“Patriarch Ghalim isn’t feeling well after eating some unhygienic food. I already prescribed some medicine for him, but I don’t know when he’d be able to get back at being patriarch since his digestive system was never good.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, is that so? Never knew he had something like that,” Patriarch Shuro mumbled. “There’s this really bad rumor about him being poisoned, Grandpa Piss, we never had something wicked like that in Badril Village.”</p>\n<p>“No, no no no, I can assure you, it’s not poison. I’ve been in the business more than seventy years--it’s <em>not</em> a poison.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss helped Yashura Family a lot when the patriarch’s in-law, Jhuro’s wife, had Shira in her belly. So Patriarch Shuro had long esteemed Grandpa Piss’s medicinal skill, even though he didn’t really had any idea how skillful the friendly old man was. He believed Grandpa Piss in the end.</p>\n<p>“We shouldn’t talk about sad things, Patriarch. Here, I bought a <em>tuak</em> my family handmade ourself. Let’s give it a try,” Grandpa Piss said.</p>\n<p>“Please, let me,” Butler Yulong asked the <em>tuak</em> bottle Grandpa Piss took out and poured it evenly to Patriarch Shuro’s, Grandpa Piss’s, along with Snotty’s glasses.</p>\n<p>The second thing Patriarch Shuro loved, after coconuts, was a strong <em>tuak</em>. He was the first one to gulp his glass clean, and he sighed about how good Grandpa Piss’s family <em>tuak</em> craft was. However, soon after that, his eyes somehow became heavy.</p>\n<p>“Huhh… usually, I still can drink till dawn…” Patriarch Shuro said with a yawn. “Let’s drink together… come on, Snotty, come drink with Uncle Shuro more.”</p>\n<p>“Patriarch, I think you are tired,” Yulong said softly, rejecting to pour patriarch’s glass.</p>\n<p>“Snotty, you go accompany Uncle Shuro inside,” Grandpa Piss said.</p>\n<p>Snotty nodded while still holding his glass full of <em>tuak</em>. The liquor was definitely mixed with something. Considering it was his grandfather who presented it, it was amazing to see Patriarch Shuro Yashura to be able to resist the urge to sleepiness. Snotty stood up and brought the yawning Shuro Yashura away.</p>\n<p>After both of them gone, Yulong picked up a clean glass. He poured the liquor that made Patriarch Shuro sleepy and drank it for himself. Grandpa Piss took out his second bottle and accompanied Yulong drinking <em>tuak</em>.</p>\n<p>“Is there’s something you need to discuss with me?” Yulong asked.</p>\n<p>“Indeed, it’s about Ghalim Malikh’s real condition…” Grandpa Piss didn’t leave any details when he told the Butler Yulong what had really happened in Malikh Family, particularly his discovery about the true nature of poison that made Patriarch Ghalim bedridden.</p>\n<p>When he heard that shocking fact, there was no surprise in the butler’s old face. Only sorrow and regret.</p>\n<p>“I knew this would happened,” Yulong sighed.</p>\n<p>“Then there’s Blackwood Family too…” Grandpa Piss’s sigh followed. “They seems interested in taking away Young Lady Bhela as a bride… I really don’t know what to say…”</p>\n<p>Yulong drank the <em>tuak</em> and told Grandpa Piss his reasoning, “That boy from Blackwood Family still hasn’t accepted Sir Jhuro’s decission to retire sixteen years ago. He’s been keeping quiet because he knew even the royalty and the organization behind him couldn’t protect him from Old Sir Lharu’s and Old Madam Sari’s retrubution. Time’s change. I reckon there’s some change somewhere that make him cocky.”</p>\n<p>“Old Sir and Old Madam too far away to give help in case something like this happens suddenly. Should I help you and Sir Jhuro keeping tabs on Blackwood Family?” Grandpa Piss asked.</p>\n<p>While Jhuro Yashura left behind resources and men outside before he retired, he almost never interacted with the high society of nobility. For ears and eyes to reach those fancy places, it would take time and efforts for current Yulong and Shuro Yashura to do so. It was way better to ask Grandpa Piss who already familiar due to his family’s generations of Alchemist profession. However, Yulong rejected the offer without giving it a real thought.</p>\n<p>“You don’t need to worry. Blackwood Family only taking a ride of that boy’s ambition. If he really supports his foster family right from the start, Blackwood won’t be stuck with their viscount nobility rank.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss wanted to offer any more help, but he long sensed the old butler’s distrust of him on affairs that didn’t include medicines and elixirs. So he kept his mouth shut for the time being.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, a golden owl landed on the veranda where the two old men enjoyed their <em>tuak</em>. The own brought a small piece of paper and inked quill with it.</p>\n<p>“Go, send this message to Sir Jhuro, as fast as possible!” Butler Yulong said to the owl after he wrote his tiny letter. Then he glanced at Grandpa Piss and said, “this is an owl I keep around in case there’s an emergency. Sir Jhuro also brought one with him.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss nodded with a painful smile. This golden owl was long thought to be extinct, but the reality there were small amounts of them were being kept in case of emergencies. They were rare, almost becoming birds of legend. Small to medium sized kingdoms wouldn’t dare to think getting their hands on it, not to mention Grandpa Piss’s own family. But this old butler had one with him. And the prodigial man of Yashura Family casually brought this treasure bird with him to travel around the southern land.</p>\n<p>“This is really for emergency,” Yulong said coldly, knowing full well the old Alchemist’s envy.</p>\n<p>“I know, I know--for emergency.”</p>\n<p>The owl then flew away bringing Yulong’s letter.</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss and Snotty returned back to their own village the next morning. After sending them away, Yulong found out the young master, Shira Yashura, wanted to go to the market to pick some goods for his contracted pedlers to sell. He was worried the young master’s inexperience getting him exploited. Therefore, he waited in the gate and followed the boy from behind.</p>\n<p>In front of an inn owned by Elzhier Family, Yulong saw a familiar eastern Kaya man came out with a respectable, but humble Mossack man behind him. The Kaya man, Sir Kurusiya, noticed Yulong, immediately cupped his fist and bowed his body. That was a salute of great respect eastern Kaya men usually give to people they regard highly. Sir Baront Staterwind didn’t know what was going on, so he imitated his companion to salute Yulong even though he didn’t really know he was only a butler.</p>\n<p>“You know them, Yulong?” Shira asked.</p>\n<p>“The Kaya man once works in the same place as your father, young master.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, that’s why you know him.” Yulong was his mother helper, and his father brought him along to Yashura Family when Shira still in his mother’s belly. Shira never liked to listen about his father’s past, even though it was often glorified since he was completely stopped marauding bandits from approaching Badril Village. Walking toward the market, Shira kept quiet and didn’t ask the matter any further.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Far away from Badril Village, the golden owl Yulong tasked with the emergency letter flew through walls of mist and mountains. It instinctively knew the location of its recipient, Jhuro Yashura, even though Yulong wasn’t necesserarily knew where he was. Not even a half day passed by since the bird took off from Yashura Family, it flew already more than halfway toward its destination.</p>\n<p>Its speed was unprecendeted amongst the magical beast. No wonder commonfolks thought it was the bird of the legend. It was a shame that it failed to detect a single flash on the horizon, resulting it to succumb to a terrible fate.</p>\n<p><em>Flap flap flap!</em></p>\n<p>The owl futilely tried to avoid danger.</p>\n<p>A single flash all it took to capture the dumbfounded owl. A pair of cold talons gripped its short neck and the next thing it knew, the owl panically flapping its wings in search of oxygen, only to be deprived of fresh air even more. The owl couldn’t see the beast, it only saw a dashingly crimson flash before it was captured by the neck. The hostile beast scretched, only after that the owl realized a damned predator eagle already got it. Annoyed by the owl’s desperate struggle, the eagle broke its neck. The handsome crimson-colored eagle then delivered the dead owl to a mysterious masked man, who then passed it to another man--a pale, thin man who only dressed himself as black as the phantom itself.</p>\n<p>“This owl coming out from Yashura Family, Mister Blackwood. The bird brings a letter with it,” the masked man said as he presented the letter to the pale man.</p>\n<p>“Ah, so they figured it out about the poison,” the pale man with Blackwood surname said. Beside him and the masked man, there was a third man who drained the blood of the golden owl, prepared a little feast of its dead body. The man was very peculiar; bald, with veined oversized muscles that looked like it was almost exploded, and the strange tatooes that covered its body. He was a northern barbarian, the kind that never took orders from civilized men no matter they came from the west, south, or the east. Yet, when the Blackwood guy told him top plucking the dead owl, he obidiently put aside the carcass, not daring to show any hints of disatisfaction.</p>\n<p>“Mister, the young lady of Malikh Family turns out to be a four-elemental Unique Class, she’s a real talent with tremendous potential--your sister tries to take her to Blackwood Family and having a setback because there’s some experts happened to visit Malikh Family. Shall we send anymore resources to help her?”</p>\n<p>“What’s her Blackwood Family have to do with me? It’s already good enough I let her to use my name to coerce people and strengthen her influence in commerce world. She’s getting annoying every time she’s using my toys. That Jhuju’s poison I sent to her only a reminder to Ghalim of our old friendship, my sister should be thankful enough if she gets some benefits from it.”</p>\n<p>The masked man knew the pale man was irritated by his sister’s cockiness. So he excused himself and brought the crimson eagle with him, disappearing into the shadow.</p>\n<p>“We’ve rested enough,” the pale man said as he crumbled the small letter he read. The bald barbarian’s head cocked and he await the order. “Prepare the horses,” the man continued, “I’ve got an old friend I should say hi to.”</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-5/chapter-5":"<authors-note id=\"Radhy\" type=\"danger\">\n<p>I don’t recommend reading from here onwards because the chapter below is still from the previous draft, which is different from the previous 4 chapters. Further edits will be made that most likely makes this chapter quite different than the current one.</p>\n</authors-note>\n<p>In a certain hall in Malikh Family’s left wing complex, four people sat idly on the bamboo mats covered floor. They were being served local-specialty ginger drinks mixed with brown sugar with herbs to drink. There were also some roasted peanuts to chew. Despite they dressed humbly when attending the Ngajen Ceremony, three of them were elders with statuses, while one of them, the sword bearing Kaya man, wasn’t anyone to ignore either.</p>\n<p>Having knowing this, they still waiting for their host, Bhela Malikh, to wrap up the Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>“Still,” Madame Sylvia said after a sip of ginger drink, “I wouldn’t have expected the girl’s talent to be that rare when she approached my sect with the invitation. The top brass only interested of her being the top grade during the seminar thus sent me to check her out. How about you, Mister Harrington?”</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t expecting it either. I only interested when the report said she showed a potential of being two elemental-affinities Archer. Three already great, but with four elementals, chances she’ll get her name down in history books.”</p>\n<p>“That is what happen if she able to live long enough to develop her full potential,” the quiet man with sharp aura remarked. His face was thin, rough, and since he never liked to smile, he always looked like he meant business. The man was role model of eastern Kaya race ancient warriors--stand and sit in straight posture, humorless, and most importantly, always bringing the sharp, thin sword of katana on his hips.</p>\n<p>Madame Sylvia was interested on his remark. So she asked, “Oh, why you think of that, Sir Kurusiya?”</p>\n<p>The eastern man replied, “Because she tangled herself with Blackwood Family,” he paused. “If this Blackwood the same one from this Blackwood guy I know, then it’s definitely a bad news for her.”</p>\n<p>Mister Harrington from Elemental Stone School disagreed.</p>\n<p>“Since when our factions become soft?” he questioned. “We’re not that pitiful to handle some second-rate noble family. Honestly, I think that young man from that Blackwood Family such a pest. If Young Lady Bhela asks for my favor, I’ll handle him cleanly and thoroughly--right here, right now.”</p>\n<p>“I’m not talking about Blackwood Family, I’m talking about the creepy guy with Blackwood as his last name,” Sir Kurusiya said as he put down his ginger drink. He wasn’t happy, so Madame Sylvia signaled Mister Harrington that it best not to continue arguing with the scary eastern Kaya man.</p>\n<p>The hall suddenly turned quiet. Then, the fourth man was happily enjoyed his drink, out of the blue he blurted for his opinion that no one asked for. “That boy from Yashura Family is sure interesting…”</p>\n<p>Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia smiled wryly. Nobody said anything about Yashura Family up until now. The fourth man, Baront Staterwind, came from a very peculiar faction. Which actually had nothing to do with Bhela’s type of talent. Even when he had already came to Badril Village, none would think he accepted Bhela Malikh’s invitation just to scout her talent.</p>\n<p>The hall’s door was knocked. Bhela entered. She politely greeted the four respected guests before she sat down.</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry for the wait, dear elders. Malikh Family hasn’t prepared the best dishes for you during the ceremony, so I asked the best chef we have to cook special meals for you,” Bhela said, then she glanced at the door. “Please enter, aunty!”</p>\n<p>The moment she called, a middle-aged woman who helped Bhela in the kitchen before came with a line of maidservants, bringing freshly cooked dinner meals with them. It was better than what the Malikhs served for the guests before, even compared to the meals served for the family’s important guests cooked by Bhela as the chief chef.</p>\n<p>“I rather you serve me some alcohol,” the eastern Sir Kurusiya said to her.</p>\n<p>Bhela nodded at his request and asked the aunty to fetch the best alcohol she could find. Of course, the best person to get help was the elder who provided Bhela with the hall to host her guests. Bhela hoped the said elder already knew the importance of this meeting thus not being stingy with his alcohol collection.</p>\n<p>“Can we start now, young lady? I don’t have a good alcohol tolerance so I rather get this completed before us adults get to drink,” Madame Sylvia said.</p>\n<p>“We have delicious food here served, Madame Sylvia. To be honest, all the wait before is for the aunties preparing dinner for dear elders,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>But not of the adults believed her words easily.</p>\n<p>“Hoho, you seem so nervous, young lady. You might not look like it, but you seem about to cry,” Sir Baront Staterwind said.</p>\n<p>“Just state what you want from us, don’t waste anymore time,” Sir Kurusiya urged.</p>\n<p>Bhela lowered her head. With her lips tremblingly parted, she said, “As you might know, my father fell ill when I was overseas attending the seminar. My mother has contacted many doctors and alchemists to make medicines for him, yet my father’s condition never improved. I request for elders’ wisdom and strength, please help my poor father, he was in misery for months…”</p>\n<p>Bhela prostated.</p>\n<p>“Please, help me father… he’s dying… please…” she begged.</p>\n<p>Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia exchanged glances. The peculiar beardy man, Sir Baront, merely nodded without letting his thoughts known. Meanwhile, Sir Kurusiya, who didn’t bulge seeing the pretty girl begging in front of him, coldly said, “Well, this is really a waste of time.”</p>\n<p>Hearing the eastern man snorted, Bhela’s heart went cold. She prepared herself bowing down for help, without stating a single offer to prove how desperate herself.</p>\n<p>“And, young lady…” Madame Sylvia asked slowly, “what would you do if someone managed to heal your father?”</p>\n<p>Bhela rose up. She looked straight to Madam Sylvia’s gaze, then said, “Anything,”</p>\n<p>“Anything?”</p>\n<p>“Anything.”</p>\n<p>The room went quiet. Only Mister Harrington’s regretful sigh could be heard.</p>\n<p>It was Sir Baront Staterwind who explained with a good intention, “It really seems you haven’t grasped the situation you were in, young lady. The guest who gave you the gift from before, he’s a young master of a family known as the peerless medicine makers and doctors. If they couldn’t cure your father illness, then I believe no one in this room knows who really can.”</p>\n<p>“If I had a petty mind, young lady, I’d kill for the cosmetic you got from them. That’s how valuable their skills are,” Madam Sylvia said as she shook her head in pity.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh bit her lips. She was eloquent when she invited these experts months ago. Yet tonight, she had completely became tongue-tied and defeated. The cold air suddenly felt more unbearable. Although the warm meals’ delicious aroma wafted through the hall, not a single person had any incentive to touch their food. Everyone in the hall sunken into silence.</p>\n<p>“You want my advice, young lady?” the sharp voice of Sir Kurusiya sliced through the awkward atmosphere. He continued, “Having turned your back against Yashura Family is the dumbest decision you did. I didn’t come here because of you. I know your father, and I certainly know that swordsman from Yashura Family more. It’s a pity I couldn’t meet them today. Really, a complete waste miles and miles of journey.”</p>\n<p>With that, Sir Kurusiya, stood up and prepared to leave.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh quickly swallowed her bitterness, also stood up and said, “Please, Elder Kurusiya, let me see you the way out.”</p>\n<p>“No, don’t,” Sir Kurusiya flatly rejected her offer. “Sit down. These three fogies still haven’t decided what they want to do with you. Better think carefully about what you’re going to say to them next.”</p>\n<p>The eastern man saw himself out. Following his suggestion, Bhela Malikh sat down again and faced the three experts, with her mind suddenly became as blank as a barren field in the corner of abandoned land. She didn’t know what she ought to say to them, seeing the looks of pity they directed at her. Then, just when she managed to regain her bravery to say something, the door slammed open--</p>\n<p>“I come as the representative of Blackwood Family!” Young Master Frane Blackwood boldly yelled.</p>\n<p>He swagered himself in along with Elder Jhamil’s son and the adjutant of Blackwood Family under his wings. The arrogant behaviour of this young noble completely disregard the experts in the room. Madame Sylvia had enough. She dissed him, “What are you doing here uninvited?”</p>\n<p>Instead of the adjutant who usually spoke for his young master, it was the young elder of Malikh Family, Elder Jhamil’s son who replying. “This madam has eyes but doesn’t know what good for her. Of course Young Master Blackwood is invited! He’s the special guest of Malikh Family after all!”</p>\n<p>“What’s your name, boy?” the middle-aged woman hissed.</p>\n<p>“I’m Elder Jhamil’s eldest son! What’s up with you, you don’t have the right to know my name!”</p>\n<p>“Is that it? Very well. It seems just because I respect the southerner custom by dressing commonly you ignorant people already forgot what's best for you. Very well!”</p>\n<p><em>Zziiing!</em></p>\n<p>With a flashing draw of metallic sword, Madame Sylvia stood up to give this ignorant young elder a lesson. But her companion Mister Harrington quickly pulled her back before things really blown up.</p>\n<p>“You brought a weapon with you!” the Elder Jhamil’s son screamed with his finger pointing at Madame Sylvia who already trembling holding back her fury. “Do you not know what’s gonna happen to guests who bring weapons inside their host’s home?”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood rolled his eyes and told his adjutant, “Send this toad out of here, he’s too noisy!”</p>\n<p>“Right away,” the adjutant said. Then with his bony hands, he pulled the screaming Elder Jhamil’s son forcefully.</p>\n<p>“Is the discussion still ongoing?” Frane Blackwood asked the sitting guests as he tightened the blue necktie he wore. He said to Bhela, “Blackwood Family offers a lifetime terms of benefit for you, young lady. Not only medicines, if it boost potion you ask, or equipments, magic items, weapons--you name it, we have all things you’d dare to imagine!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho,” his uninvited offer gave Sir Baront Staterwind a chuckle. The three guests Bhela invited hailed from their own factions, so even if they wanted to rope Bhela in, they would consult with their higher ups about the specific terms they’d give to her as benefits. However, Blackwood Family was, in fact, only a noble family, not an organizational faction, with the only way in was through marriage--so of course the young noble would be able to offer a “lifetime benefits” to her so brazenly.</p>\n<p>“Thank you for holding back your anger, Madame Sylvia,” Bhela completely bowed her head to the angry guest while she completely disregarded Young Master Blackwood’s offers.</p>\n<p>Madame Sylvia nodded. She then looked at Young Master Blackwood and snorted. “Young lady, think carefully about what we said before. Some incapable people only able to spout honey trap to get what they want. Don’t be foolish because your father’s situation.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you for the advice…”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood wanted to argue with this lady. But he also held himself back as he didn’t know the other party’s identity. Therefore, all he could do was haughtily smiling elegantly as a proper noble as he was.</p>\n<p>“Has the discussion already started?” Frane Blackwood asked again. Pity him, not even one interested in answering. Because of that his face became red as he fumed with anger.</p>\n<p>“Ah,” Sir Baront Staterwind looked outside the window and slapped his thigh, “look how late it is! I planned to sleep early because I have something I need to do tomorrow early in the morning!”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh quickly offered to see him till the gate.</p>\n<p>“Hoho, how about you two?” Sir Baront asked the last two foreign experts, the pair of middle-aged man and woman, “overstaying your visit is considering a burden to these good Mossack folks, don’t you think so?”</p>\n<p>“I’m but an ignorant western lady, I know little about the way of the southern people, so please don’t mind us being shameless,” Madame Sylvia said. She then looked at Bhela, “Young Lady Bhela, Mister Harrington and I apparently haven’t booked our place in the village’s inns. We don’t know our talks would turned out dragged this late. For this I have to beg you to let us stay in Malikh Family for a few good days.”</p>\n<p>“Hoho…” Sir Baront Staterwind chuckled as he looked at the poker face pair of experts. Wasn’t the four of them--including Sir Kurusiya, checked in the same inn this afternoon? It was clear Madame Sylvia and Mister Harrington had their own intentions, thus Sir Baront Staterwind shrugged the idea of exposing their little white lies.</p>\n<p>And with that, Bhela Malikh led the three expert guests she invited out of the room. Young Master Blackwood, who was ignored so hard she almost exploded, yelling, “Young Lady Bhela!”</p>\n<p>Bhela turned around. “Yes, Young Master Blackwood?”</p>\n<p>“How about me?”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh blinked. Then she picked a bowl of roasted peanuts and approached him, saying softly, “Please sit down and enjoy this snack. I need to attend to my guests.”</p>\n<p>Hearing her soft, yet slightly cold voice, Young Lady Blackwood the understood something that made him excited, so excited he obediently sat down and nimbled on the roasted peanuts the beautiful Young Lady Bhela gave him.</p>\n<p>Then after Bhela brought the guests out, the Blackwood Family adjutant who was waiting outside came in inside the hall.</p>\n<p>“What are you doing?!” Young Master Blackwood hissed.</p>\n<p>The adjutant gawked. “Young master, I’m here to serve you…”</p>\n<p>“Serve me?” the young master cringed. What a joke! Soon he’d have a time being alone with Young Lady Bhela, and this old man wanted to be here right when he had the chance of his lifetime? What if there--during the discussion--was an accident where he had to be responsible as a man? Would he be happy if the adjutant was here when that happened?</p>\n<p>Absolutely not!</p>\n<p>“Get out! Don’t dawdle around here tonight! I need to discuss an important manner with Young Lady Bhela secretly!”</p>\n<p>“Y-young master--”</p>\n<p>“What are you waiting for! Go back to the inn and don’t bother me till the next morning!”</p>\n<p>The adjutant naturally understood what was inside the young master’s mind. He didn’t dare to linger around. With careful steps, he closed the door and went back to the inn Blackwood Family checked in.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Young Master Blackwood was so excited he couldn’t sit calmly alone in the hall. The thought of having private discussion with a girl as pretty as Bhela Malikh made him thinking a lot of things. Slowly, he getting horny.</p>\n<p>“What is taking her so long?” he mumbled to himself after waiting a fruitless thirty minutes. “Is it maybe she needs to… prepare, herself?”</p>\n<p>If it was going to be her first time, of course she needed time to prepare herself, Young Master Blackwood thought. This young noble had “befriend” and participating in “private discussions” with many experienced women. But virgin girls, he never tasted any.</p>\n<p>Because of that, he willing to wait however much longer for the young lady to prepare herself. And thus, after waiting for another thirty minutes, nothing happened. Nothing happened for the next hour as well. Then, after waiting for nearly three hours alone, the door finally opened…</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela, you finally ready!” Young Master Blackwood snapped out of his sleepy face and excitedly came to greet the visitor. Much to his disappointment, the visitor turned out to be the faithful adjutant.</p>\n<p>“Why is that you?!” Young Master Blackwood roared.</p>\n<p>“Y-young master… let’s get back to the inn,” the adjutant nervously asked.</p>\n<p>“Where’s Young Lady Bhela?”</p>\n<p>“She is in her room…”</p>\n<p>“Then you send someone there to ask her when she’s going to meet me,” the young noble ordered.</p>\n<p>“I’m afraid I can’t… young master…”</p>\n<p>“I’ve been waiting for hours, why?”</p>\n<p>The adjutant gulped before he replied.</p>\n<p>“Because the young lady has already gone sleeping since three hours ago!”</p>\n<p>So much for his dreamy private discussion! Young Master Blackwood was so angry for being misled that he slapped the adjutant’s face all the way back to his inn.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A single torch on a stick stubbornly lit the corner of the village in spite of the strong wind. A howling wolf in the distance reinforced the lone, cold sense of the midnight Badril Village. The only shop that still open at this hours could be counted with one hand, and this liquor shop was one of them. No customer visited it except a foreign eastern Kaya man.</p>\n<p>A series of step could be heard. The sleepy shopkeeper snapped back when he heard a new customer approaching.</p>\n<p>“Give me a glass of <em>tuak</em>, shopkeeper,” the new customer ordered with a booming voice. One could see his beardy feature when his face exposed to the shop’s lantern light. “Mind if I join you, Sir Kurusiya?”</p>\n<p>The eastern man didn’t reply. He drank his alcohol instead.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront Staterwind laughed by his cold treatment. The beardy guy was an easygoing person, so he casually grabbed a bowl of steamed peanuts and started to nibble on those snacks.</p>\n<p>“You’re not visiting Bhela’s father? You said you know him, you know, saying hi to a sick old buddy?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t say hi to a dying man,” Sir Kurusiya said.</p>\n<p>The answer made the air awkward. So Sir Baront quickly came with another topic.</p>\n<p>“It seems those two lovers adamant to protect the girl,” he said, referring to the other two experts who once were couple before Mister Harrington lost Madame Sylvia to another guy. “Or I think they just want some privacy to have some little reunion… who knows?”</p>\n<p>Sir Kurusiya never bothered with petty gossip, he callously replied, “They don’t know Malikh Family. They can’t protect her forever.”</p>\n<p>“Exactly,” Sir Baront Staterwind agreed. After that both men continued drinking without saying anything.</p>\n<p>“Hey shopkeeper,” Sir Baront called, “don’t you have anything with less alcohol? I have a business I’d like to deal with tomorrow, so I want to avoid shitty hangover.”</p>\n<p>“I have some sweet <em>tuak</em>,” the shopkeeper poured a new bottle into Sir Baront’s empty glass, “this one usually for them boys who haven’t gone coming of age ceremony. No alcohol, costs as little as four copper kobe coins.”</p>\n<p>“Four coppers, ah! Why’s that the souther I go the cheaper the drink?” he sipped it, “mm! Pretty good, my good man!”</p>\n<p>He tipped the shopkeeper with a silver coin. The shopkeeper was dumbfounded but quickly recovered and hid the coin safely.</p>\n<p>Sir Kurusiya said to Sir Baront, “You want to go to Yashura Family tomorrow?”</p>\n<p>“How did you know?”</p>\n<p>“Even though I can’t see him, I know the one who repelled Bhela’s arrow was a Nalaq,” Sir Kurusiya said.</p>\n<p>“Hoho, since I managed to rope in the young lady of Yurin Family, I’ve got promoted to an instructor,” Sir Baront smiled widely. “Doing the legwork isn’t my job anymore… but checking him and the boy won’t hurt, so I’m going. Hmm, I wonder if the Nalaq has already form his contract?”</p>\n<p>“Huuh…” the shopkeeper, who had been hearing their chatting, couldn’t help but asked, “you good sir, what’s this talking about a Nalaq having to do with Yashura Family?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, you’re a Yashura?” Sir Baront asked.</p>\n<p>“I’m Elzhier, from the outer family,” the shopkeeper said. “I’ve been in this village for forty years, but never I’ve heard any Nalaq passing by.”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, that’s why I’m going. Usually a rogue Nalaq isn’t someone tied with a faction, so they aren’t that big of deal--which also make them easier to rope in!”</p>\n<p>“Ooohh! Are you a Nalaq expert, mister? From overseas? Our family’s eldest young lady actually was scouted by a passing expert from overseas too, an expert from purple something sect!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, you mean Purple Garden Sect?” Sir Baront Staterwind and asked as he played along.</p>\n<p>But Sir Kurusiya was sceptic. “Purple Garden Sect is too far. And someone from that kind of superpower faction won’t be too idle to accidentally passing by on this kind of rural village.”</p>\n<p>Sir Baront nodded at Sir Kurusiya’s logic. Even if it was that particular sect that accepted the said young lady, both experts wouldn’t be too sure about whether she could be the sect’s legitimate disciple. Their doubts made the shopkeeper embarrassed. Since ten years ago, the tales of the eldest young lady of Elzhier Family being accepted by a foreign expert was a legend amongst Badril Village locals. Except her and the recent Malikh Family’s young lady, no one in the village was lucky got scouted to study oversea, so it became a fact that Elzhier Family was very proud of--and was one of the reasons why the Elzhier could win the village head’s seat from Yashura Family after their decades of leading Badril Village. But the problem was, in the letters their young lady sent home, she always talked about shops, fashions, and some other trivial stuffs that usually young women her age excited about. That made even her father, the current Elzhier Family’s patriarch and the Village Head, felt it was became difficult to still boasting the young lady’s status after ten years of her spending overseas.</p>\n<p>“But still, experts, you might not know this, but our eldest young lady was Young Lady of Malikh Family’s closest childhood friend! When Young Lady Bhela Malikh only a little girl our young lady gave her a lot of pointers and knowledge, so much that I assure that if it wasn’t for her being there for Young Lady Bhela, the Malikh Family wouldn’t get their talented Unique Class for at least the next one hundred years!”</p>\n<p>“Right…” Sir Baront became awkward instantly. To think some ignorant folks believed blessing of Unique Classes was that simple, even Sir Kurusiya scoffed at the idea.</p>\n<p>The shopkeeper’s face became red as he realized it was wise not to delay any longer. So he quickly said, “If you have some spare time, sir experts, I’m sure our Elzhier Family willing to entertain you!”</p>\n<p>After paying for their drinks, even the agreeable Sir Baront Staterwind felt it was very awkward for him to return to this little shop. Both decided not to get themselves involved with Elzhier Family after the shopkeeper’s little salesman talks, whilst not knowing the inn they stayed inn owned by Elzhier Family.</p>\n<p>On the way back, Sir Baront asked Sir Kurusiya for advice.</p>\n<p>“Yo, Kurusiya, I’m going to accept the Yashura boy as my third disciple if the Nalaq’s pretty good. But, you know, the Nalaq who contracted with youngest disciple is a master thirteen thousands years ago. She was a heavy weight figure, so I reckon I’ll let her calls the shot. What’s your opinion on this?”</p>\n<p>“How powerful is this Nalaq you’re talking about?”</p>\n<p>Sir Baront grinned. “You know the legend about Seven Pillars of Tiramikal Continent? She’s the Frost Mage mentioned in that history. Pretty neat, huh? She was able to revive as Nalaq and regained her consciousness five years ago. All the big shots in my Blue Robe Society can’t wait for the girl she’s contracted with to formally accepted into our faction.”</p>\n<p>“If that’s the case then your disciple isn’t necesserily worse than Malikh’s four elemental Archer girl.”</p>\n<p>“So you know why I can’t accept the boy if he’s too crude--I can’t afford to offend this madam Nalaq even the slightest bit.” he took out a bag of roasted peanuts he bought from the shopkeeper, and started to nibble on them. “I’m going to write a letter to my disciples, they’ve been playing around in the neighboring village. This madam Nalaq will come and check the boy herself.”</p>\n<p>Sir Kurusiya abruptly stopped his steps.</p>\n<p>“You want my advice?” he looked straight at Sir Baront’s eyes. “My advice is simple. You’re going to make this madam Nalaq of yours polite and you’re going to beg her to be mindful of her attitude in front of Yashura Family.”</p>\n<p>“You’re joking? You serious?”</p>\n<p>“I’m always serious,” Sir Kurusiya said.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Patriarch of Yashura Family, Shuro Yashura, was exhilarated to see Grandpa Piss and Snotty came to visit the village. One part because he treasured the friendships between their family and Grandpa Piss’s relatives, but mainly, he got to show-off his latest coconut cake recipe.</p>\n<p>“Ah, this is life, drinking <em>tuak</em> when we’re watching the moon, getting drunk while we’re eating coconuts. What a life!” Patriarch Shuro mumbled.</p>\n<p>“What a life indeed,” Grandpa Piss nodded with a low chuckle. On the sky, the full moon was shining bright really beautiful.</p>\n<p>After he’d done his part in ngajen ceremony, Patriarch Shuro Yashura accompanied the old Alchemist and his grandson in a spacious veranda, where they ate coconut cakes and drinking _tuak _while spending time moongazing. They had the Yashura Family’s sole butler, Yulong, to hold the _tuak _bottle and refilled their cups when empty.</p>\n<p>“Grandpa Piss, why didn’t you tell us beforehand before you visit Badril Village? We ran out of <em>rendang</em> before even the ceremony ended, so I’m sorry if you couldn’t eat <em>rendang</em>!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, we already ate chicken curry in Malikh Family, you don’t have to prepare food for us,” Grandpa Piss said.</p>\n<p>“How about breakfast? Are we still have leftover chickens, Yulong?”</p>\n<p>“We still have some leftover grilled village chicken, I’ll talk with the kitchen to reheat two portion first thing in the morning,” Yulong said.</p>\n<p>The Yashura Family’s patriarch was a role model of the stereotype Mossack people. He loved to cook and loved even more to feed people. It was no wonder why southern Mossacks’ visitors always felt welcomed whenever they visited the southern lands.</p>\n<p>“I sent them to bring <em>rendang</em> to Malikh Family, I never expected something like that to happen, hah!” Patriarch Shuro shook his head with a weak smile plastered on his face. During their talk, Grandpa Piss mentioned they met with Shira and Mila, as well mentioned the duel that happened between the two families’ young ladies and the upcoming duel between Shira and the young noble from Blackwood Family. “Whatever, if jerks wanted to fight with us, we won’t back down. Yashura Family never a coward!”</p>\n<p>“I believe Young Master Shira knows what he has to do,” Grandpa Piss assured.</p>\n<p>“I hope so, pity his father never around to hold the sky falling for him,” Patriarch Shuro gulped his <em>tuak</em>. “Anyway, let’s talk about something else. That Ghalim, you checked on him, Grandpa? What’s happened to him?”</p>\n<p>Snotty a little scared when Shuro Yashura suddenly brought up that topic. Snotty glanced at Butler Yulong’s wrinkled face, Yulong smiled back at him. The big muscle man couldn’t help but shuddered inside.</p>\n<p>“Patriarch Ghalim isn’t feeling well after eating some unhygienic food. I already prescribed some medicine for him, but I don’t know when he’d be able to get back at being patriarch since his digestive system was never good.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, is that so? Never knew he had something like that,” Patriarch Shuro mumbled. “There’s this really bad rumor about him being poisoned, Grandpa Piss, we never had something wicked like that in Badril Village.”</p>\n<p>“No, no no no, I can assure you, it’s not poison. I’ve been in the business more than seventy years--it’s <em>not</em> a poison.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss helped Yashura Family a lot when the patriarch’s in-law, Jhuro’s wife, had Shira in her belly. So Patriarch Shuro had long esteemed Grandpa Piss’s medicinal skill, even though he didn’t really had any idea how skillful the friendly old man was. He believed Grandpa Piss in the end.</p>\n<p>“We shouldn’t talk about sad things, Patriarch. Here, I bought a <em>tuak</em> my family handmade ourself. Let’s give it a try,” Grandpa Piss said.</p>\n<p>“Please, let me,” Butler Yulong asked the <em>tuak</em> bottle Grandpa Piss took out and poured it evenly to Patriarch Shuro’s, Grandpa Piss’s, along with Snotty’s glasses.</p>\n<p>The second thing Patriarch Shuro loved, after coconuts, was a strong <em>tuak</em>. He was the first one to gulp his glass clean, and he sighed about how good Grandpa Piss’s family <em>tuak</em> craft was. However, soon after that, his eyes somehow became heavy.</p>\n<p>“Huhh… usually, I still can drink till dawn…” Patriarch Shuro said with a yawn. “Let’s drink together… come on, Snotty, come drink with Uncle Shuro more.”</p>\n<p>“Patriarch, I think you are tired,” Yulong said softly, rejecting to pour patriarch’s glass.</p>\n<p>“Snotty, you go accompany Uncle Shuro inside,” Grandpa Piss said.</p>\n<p>Snotty nodded while still holding his glass full of <em>tuak</em>. The liquor was definitely mixed with something. Considering it was his grandfather who presented it, it was amazing to see Patriarch Shuro Yashura to be able to resist the urge to sleepiness. Snotty stood up and brought the yawning Shuro Yashura away.</p>\n<p>After both of them gone, Yulong picked up a clean glass. He poured the liquor that made Patriarch Shuro sleepy and drank it for himself. Grandpa Piss took out his second bottle and accompanied Yulong drinking <em>tuak</em>.</p>\n<p>“Is there’s something you need to discuss with me?” Yulong asked.</p>\n<p>“Indeed, it’s about Ghalim Malikh’s real condition…” Grandpa Piss didn’t leave any details when he told the Butler Yulong what had really happened in Malikh Family, particularly his discovery about the true nature of poison that made Patriarch Ghalim bedridden.</p>\n<p>When he heard that shocking fact, there was no surprise in the butler’s old face. Only sorrow and regret.</p>\n<p>“I knew this would happened,” Yulong sighed.</p>\n<p>“Then there’s Blackwood Family too…” Grandpa Piss’s sigh followed. “They seems interested in taking away Young Lady Bhela as a bride… I really don’t know what to say…”</p>\n<p>Yulong drank the <em>tuak</em> and told Grandpa Piss his reasoning, “That boy from Blackwood Family still hasn’t accepted Sir Jhuro’s decission to retire sixteen years ago. He’s been keeping quiet because he knew even the royalty and the organization behind him couldn’t protect him from Old Sir Lharu’s and Old Madam Sari’s retrubution. Time’s change. I reckon there’s some change somewhere that make him cocky.”</p>\n<p>“Old Sir and Old Madam too far away to give help in case something like this happens suddenly. Should I help you and Sir Jhuro keeping tabs on Blackwood Family?” Grandpa Piss asked.</p>\n<p>While Jhuro Yashura left behind resources and men outside before he retired, he almost never interacted with the high society of nobility. For ears and eyes to reach those fancy places, it would take time and efforts for current Yulong and Shuro Yashura to do so. It was way better to ask Grandpa Piss who already familiar due to his family’s generations of Alchemist profession. However, Yulong rejected the offer without giving it a real thought.</p>\n<p>“You don’t need to worry. Blackwood Family only taking a ride of that boy’s ambition. If he really supports his foster family right from the start, Blackwood won’t be stuck with their viscount nobility rank.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss wanted to offer any more help, but he long sensed the old butler’s distrust of him on affairs that didn’t include medicines and elixirs. So he kept his mouth shut for the time being.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, a golden owl landed on the veranda where the two old men enjoyed their <em>tuak</em>. The own brought a small piece of paper and inked quill with it.</p>\n<p>“Go, send this message to Sir Jhuro, as fast as possible!” Butler Yulong said to the owl after he wrote his tiny letter. Then he glanced at Grandpa Piss and said, “this is an owl I keep around in case there’s an emergency. Sir Jhuro also brought one with him.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss nodded with a painful smile. This golden owl was long thought to be extinct, but the reality there were small amounts of them were being kept in case of emergencies. They were rare, almost becoming birds of legend. Small to medium sized kingdoms wouldn’t dare to think getting their hands on it, not to mention Grandpa Piss’s own family. But this old butler had one with him. And the prodigial man of Yashura Family casually brought this treasure bird with him to travel around the southern land.</p>\n<p>“This is really for emergency,” Yulong said coldly, knowing full well the old Alchemist’s envy.</p>\n<p>“I know, I know--for emergency.”</p>\n<p>The owl then flew away bringing Yulong’s letter.</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss and Snotty returned back to their own village the next morning. After sending them away, Yulong found out the young master, Shira Yashura, wanted to go to the market to pick some goods for his contracted pedlers to sell. He was worried the young master’s inexperience getting him exploited. Therefore, he waited in the gate and followed the boy from behind.</p>\n<p>In front of an inn owned by Elzhier Family, Yulong saw a familiar eastern Kaya man came out with a respectable, but humble Mossack man behind him. The Kaya man, Sir Kurusiya, noticed Yulong, immediately cupped his fist and bowed his body. That was a salute of great respect eastern Kaya men usually give to people they regard highly. Sir Baront Staterwind didn’t know what was going on, so he imitated his companion to salute Yulong even though he didn’t really know he was only a butler.</p>\n<p>“You know them, Yulong?” Shira asked.</p>\n<p>“The Kaya man once works in the same place as your father, young master.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, that’s why you know him.” Yulong was his mother helper, and his father brought him along to Yashura Family when Shira still in his mother’s belly. Shira never liked to listen about his father’s past, even though it was often glorified since he was completely stopped marauding bandits from approaching Badril Village. Walking toward the market, Shira kept quiet and didn’t ask the matter any further.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Far away from Badril Village, the golden owl Yulong tasked with the emergency letter flew through walls of mist and mountains. It instinctively knew the location of its recipient, Jhuro Yashura, even though Yulong wasn’t necesserarily knew where he was. Not even a half day passed by since the bird took off from Yashura Family, it flew already more than halfway toward its destination.</p>\n<p>Its speed was unprecendeted amongst the magical beast. No wonder commonfolks thought it was the bird of the legend. It was a shame that it failed to detect a single flash on the horizon, resulting it to succumb to a terrible fate.</p>\n<p><em>Flap flap flap!</em></p>\n<p>The owl futilely tried to avoid danger.</p>\n<p>A single flash all it took to capture the dumbfounded owl. A pair of cold talons gripped its short neck and the next thing it knew, the owl panically flapping its wings in search of oxygen, only to be deprived of fresh air even more. The owl couldn’t see the beast, it only saw a dashingly crimson flash before it was captured by the neck. The hostile beast scretched, only after that the owl realized a damned predator eagle already got it. Annoyed by the owl’s desperate struggle, the eagle broke its neck. The handsome crimson-colored eagle then delivered the dead owl to a mysterious masked man, who then passed it to another man--a pale, thin man who only dressed himself as black as the phantom itself.</p>\n<p>“This owl coming out from Yashura Family, Mister Blackwood. The bird brings a letter with it,” the masked man said as he presented the letter to the pale man.</p>\n<p>“Ah, so they figured it out about the poison,” the pale man with Blackwood surname said. Beside him and the masked man, there was a third man who drained the blood of the golden owl, prepared a little feast of its dead body. The man was very peculiar; bald, with veined oversized muscles that looked like it was almost exploded, and the strange tatooes that covered its body. He was a northern barbarian, the kind that never took orders from civilized men no matter they came from the west, south, or the east. Yet, when the Blackwood guy told him top plucking the dead owl, he obidiently put aside the carcass, not daring to show any hints of disatisfaction.</p>\n<p>“Mister, the young lady of Malikh Family turns out to be a four-elemental Unique Class, she’s a real talent with tremendous potential--your sister tries to take her to Blackwood Family and having a setback because there’s some experts happened to visit Malikh Family. Shall we send anymore resources to help her?”</p>\n<p>“What’s her Blackwood Family have to do with me? It’s already good enough I let her to use my name to coerce people and strengthen her influence in commerce world. She’s getting annoying every time she’s using my toys. That Jhuju’s poison I sent to her only a reminder to Ghalim of our old friendship, my sister should be thankful enough if she gets some benefits from it.”</p>\n<p>The masked man knew the pale man was irritated by his sister’s cockiness. So he excused himself and brought the crimson eagle with him, disappearing into the shadow.</p>\n<p>“We’ve rested enough,” the pale man said as he crumbled the small letter he read. The bald barbarian’s head cocked and he await the order. “Prepare the horses,” the man continued, “I’ve got an old friend I should say hi to.”</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-5/chapter-6":"<p>When the news about what happened in Malikh Family’s ngajen ceremony arrived at Blackwood Family, Madam Blackwood was so enraged she broke the tea cup she held onto the floor. Establishing the family’s foot in Badril Village was supposed to be easy, but not only he failed to gain the support of Malikh Family and the villagers, the Young Master of Blackwood Family somehow managed to incite the bedridden patriarch’s supporters to regain their lost foothold against the corrupt Malikh Family’s elders.</p>\n<p>“There’s no point keeping him in that rural village,” Madam Blackwood said. She was a flamboyant, late thirty years old woman whose beauty was so superior that the previous viscount adopt her as a daughter. “Call Frane back to the city, he’s going to spend two months training in capital!”</p>\n<p>The butler who was waiting for her bowed and went away to carry out the task.</p>\n<p>“How’s Lyla’s birthday party going?”</p>\n<p>“Reply to madam, the party has started, the guests who came only from baron nobilities and mid-rank merchants,” a maid replied.</p>\n<p>The madam glanced the timid middle-aged man who sat on the same table as her. She scoffed, saying, “Look how your daughter made a name for herself. Not only the bribe money was wasted away, she coming on trips in the seminars only resulting her made a fool out of herself! Hah, like father, like daughter! Imbecile!”</p>\n<p>Madam Blackwood hurled the new cup that recently poured with hot, scalding tea. She purposely aimed at the table so the hot water splashed on the viscount’s hands. The timid viscount didn’t make a sound when his hands getting burnt, he didn’t dare to fight against his wife. It was already ten years too late for him to retaliate in any way. From the way he dragged his limping leg to fetch damp towel for his scaling skin, it was clear the waiting servants already used to ignore him.</p>\n<p>Recently, his wife’s mood had became the worst ever since their youngest daughter came back from the two years seminars. Unlike Frane--who only registered as his son by blood in papers, Lyla hadn’t show any particular talents in becoming a Class worthy of a noble family. She had a decent progress speed, a Level 7 Novice after seminars, but that progress mainly because she never had the interest to train herself. Madam Blackwood had bribed the officials so Lyla could enter the seminars supposed to boost her standing in high society, so she could catch higher ranking nobles eyes somehow. However, that plan failed in the worst way that could happen to a noble family like the Blackwood. She made blunders and broke rules so many times that she became a laughing stock. The only families that interested in her only lower rank nobles and not-so well off merchant families.</p>\n<p>“There also no point keeping that useless girl forever in the mansion,” Madam Blackwood said. “Send her to Badril Village by tomorrow. Make some smart men tending to her needs--they have to smart enough to know how to reel those Malikh villagers to say yes when I send my words in the future!”</p>\n<p>After the son’s failure, the madam would send her daughter, to do nothing but play around in Malikh Family. Even if there was something the girl could do, the madam surely wouldn’t choose this daughter of hers who she deemed too brainless to do even the simplest tasks. Her daughter was just that useless to her. The one with received the orders were people who accompanied her, who had experience in bribing and coercing. They were tasked to devour Malikh Family from the inside. The Blackwood would surely corner Bhela Malikh this time.</p>\n<p>Somewhere else, in a colorless courtyard, a birthday party already went on for about two hours. Most guests already leaving, not unlike the year before the two-years seminars happened when the sons of noble families dallying around waiting for a chance to talk with the young lady. Today, the Young Lady of Blackwood Family turned fourteen, two years before she would considered mature, but this young miss still pouting her mouth like a little girl.</p>\n<p>The old handmaid saw her young lady was bored and offered a treat.</p>\n<p>“Young lady, try this cake. A certain famous bakery made this just for your birthday.”</p>\n<p>The cake served on a small plate along with a silver fork. The girl took only mere seconds to finish it.</p>\n<p>“Is it good?” the handmaid asked.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t matter if it’s good or not, Aunt Jiji, I still hungry with this tiny minny bit of cake! Let me eat that one!” the girl pointed at the layered cake served on the center of the party.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Lyla, you can’t!”</p>\n<p>“Why can’t I?!”</p>\n<p>“You must present yourself as a proper young lady, so you can’t!”</p>\n<p>The cake was to be portioned to serve for the same amount of guests since the last party, but because the Blackwood Family’s young lady had a bad reputation in the seminars, most invited families didn’t actually come.</p>\n<p>“But I can’t be a lady if I’m hungry, am I?”</p>\n<p>“You must learn the way. Be patient, Young Lady Lyla!”</p>\n<p>“But I am huuungriiiiieeeehhh!!!”</p>\n<p>Aunt Jiji was terrified when she realized the young lady wasn’t referred only to portion of the cake, but she wanted to eat the whole cake. This shorty girl, although her feature was thin with only her cheeks got plump, actually had a talent to be a terrifying glutton that would be seen in Tiramikal Continent every one hundred years. It was a useless talent that brought only shame to Blackwood Family.</p>\n<p>It was fortunate that before the young lady could make a big ruckus, a maidservant came to bring the news about the madam’s decision. Aunt Jiji passed it to the young lady immediately.</p>\n<p>“You heard that, young lady! Madam is going to send you for a vacation!”</p>\n<p>Lyla’s head straightened, she forgot to pout. “Vacation? Where? Where where?”</p>\n<p>“To Badril Village!”</p>\n<p>“Badril Village?” the girl tilted her head. “Where’s that?”</p>\n<p>“If you promise Aunt Jiji not to eat too much cake today, Aunt Jiji will tell you where it is…”</p>\n<p>“I will if it turned out somewhere fun!”</p>\n<p>“Badril Village is where Young Lady Bhela’s home place!”</p>\n<p>“Sis Bhela’s home?!” Lyla gasped, “yahoooo!!!”</p>\n<p>Ignoring that she was the center of attention, Lyla suddenly jumped and danced like no tomorrow. Aunt Jiji tried to stop her, but it was futile since Lyla only promised not to be glutton. The remaining guests began whispering with each other. They were people who doubted the rumors about this Young Lady Blackwood, but after seeing how childish and ridiculous the girl danced, people were finally convinced. How was this a viscount’s daughter supposed to act? The girl danced her hips and hopped around like a bunny that had an itchy bum. Soon, the Young Lady Lyla Blackwood fell to the bottom list of desired young ladies to marry. Her reputation fell from not-so-smart, to stupid, and then fell again to brainless and imbecile. People didn’t see her in a good light. But that just how a girl named Lyla Blackwood really was.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Yashura Family got a peculiar visitor these past two days. He introduced himself as an expert from overseas, and somehow this foreign expert became interested in Shira Yashura. When the story leaked by insiders from Yashura Family, people were scratching their heads, wondering what could an educated man saw from this trash who could only get himself to level 3 Novice. Some people even sneered, saying that whole news was just Yashura Family’s little trick to clear up rumors from their heir’s name.</p>\n<p>“You understand, kiddo? There are three mandatory rules if someone wants to meet privately with me. First rule, it’s a <em>she</em>, not <em>he</em>. Second rule, big boobs. Third rule, in her lower part, there must be big bubbly butts, as big as her boobs. <em>Anything</em> lesser than that you can just send them back to wherever they came from.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit said that as he moved his chess piece, eating one of Shira’s pawns.</p>\n<p>“And remember, my standard is pretty high. Consult with how loadful those girls from Big-Boobed Sect are for more information,” the Nalaq continued.</p>\n<p>“Please don’t talk nonsense. I’m being serious here,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“Ey, I’m not talking nonsense. The girls from Big-Boobed Sect are real deal, okay? They’re huge! If you don’t believe me then you should go to Elzhier Family one of these days, go check out how glorious their boobs are. They always dance or become the maidservants when they’re not on duties.”</p>\n<p>“Ol’ Good-Natured Spirit… I don’t want to hear this imaginary all-woman sect of yours. Elzhier Family is only a normal rural family, they don’t host any sect members within their walls. If they did, the Village Head would boast about it at my uncle’s face every single day.”</p>\n<p>“You just don’t believe it because you never see how great they are--their boobs, I mean. How great those melons inside tight suits are! Just think about it; leather suits and melons--two entirely different things but if they come together they’d jiggling in harmony. This Good-Natured Spirit approved their sense of style.”</p>\n<p>“Forget about it, it’s not important--”</p>\n<p>“Boobs are important, ey!”</p>\n<p>Shira waved his hand as he didn’t want to continue this nonsense. He then moved a piece and finished his turn. He returned the topic back again, “The expert said he came from a first-tier faction called Blue Robe Society. If we can get his faction’s recognition then at least my family can silence all those rumors about me--especially the recent ones, they really are becoming a pain in the ass.”</p>\n<p>“I told you. I don’t talk with guys. No boobs, no good. Period.”</p>\n<p>“You are really becoming a pain in the ass,” Shira complained.</p>\n<p>After Shira said that, Good-Natured Spirit’s knight jumped over a wall of pawns to get on his bishop. Within a single breath Shira immediately moved his rook, creating a chain reaction that exposes the Nalaq’s defence, resulting his king trapped in three different direction.</p>\n<p>“Check mate.”</p>\n<p>“Ey, what the fu--” Good-Natured Spirit rage quit, flipping the chess board. “Hah! I knew it! You brat, you intentionally make me talk about boobs in order to lower my guard, right?! Fuck! That is how it is, isn’t it?!”</p>\n<p>“No, it is not.”</p>\n<p>“You sneaky bastard. You really got me,” Good-Natured Spirit threw his hands up in the air. <br>\n“Man, I surrender, that is some sick psychological tactic you got there.”</p>\n<p>“Now I don’t really know what you’re talking about.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit waved his hands in surrender, then he lit a cigarette. “Anyway, what do you want from me this time? Money again? I prepared some kobe coins enough for you to buy some candy, here, take this.”</p>\n<p>Shira shoved back the coin bag. “Not today. I just want you to meet Sir Baront Staterwind.”</p>\n<p>“No boobs, no good. Ask something else. How about I tell you the secret place where are those Big-Boobed Sect girls take their bath, ‘ey? Seems fair deal to me.”</p>\n<p>“How many times do I have to tell you--”</p>\n<p>“Sssshhh!!” Good-Natured Spirit hushed the boy. He then whispered, “you hear that?”</p>\n<p>Because the Nalaq suddenly became vigilant, Shira instinctively lowered his voice too. “Hear what?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“I heard some rats watching us…” the Nalaq covered his mouth, as if he didn’t want people to read lips what he said next, “some big-boobed rats…”</p>\n<p>“Huh… what?”</p>\n<p>“The girls from Big-Boobed Sect… they’re here…”</p>\n<p>“The heck are you talking about? This hill is Yashura Family’s property--”</p>\n<p>“Sssshhhh! They’ve noticed me noticing them. Wait here, I’mma get you some melons for your reward!”</p>\n<p>After he saying that, Good-Natured Spirit’s figure melting into the thin air.</p>\n<p>Shira Yashura sighed. At times, asking favor to this vulgar Nalaq not only difficult, it also unpredictable he’d only incite troubles if he not careful.</p>\n<p>After his winning streak for more than half a year maybe he became cocky. He forgot the Nalaq wasn’t there to solve his problem whenever he wanted, although the Nalaq sort of ended up like that after a few months he came here. Shira got some thinking, maybe he should stop seeing this Nalaq as his convenient piggy bank for his own good.</p>\n<p>“Really, he always making a mess for me to clean. I wonder if such thoughtless Nalaqs like him are common around here… now, where’s the last piece again?” he sighed for the second time.</p>\n<p>When he was picking up chess pieces that board Good-Natured Spirit flipped earlier, Shira realized there was a missing piece. Turned out it was stuck in the hole between tree roots.</p>\n<p>He plunged his hand to look for the missing chess piece.</p>\n<p>“Ugh… my fingers can’t reach.”</p>\n<p>He tried to squirm his body to fit his hand in.</p>\n<p>“Where is it again?”</p>\n<p>He frowned. He squirmed his body again really hard.</p>\n<p>“Oh, there it--”</p>\n<p><em>BOOOOOMMMMM!!!!</em></p>\n<p>An explosion happened not far away from the place he used to hang out, creating a wave of rolling dust that swept over the hill. Shira got his hand stuck between the tree rots, he could only hugged his head with his free hand and waited for the shockwave to finish. The chess pieces he gathered already nowhere to be found. He cooked up his head, looking left and right, and saw the greeny grasses were covered with dirts and trees were uprooted. The whole hill became a shithole kind of mess.</p>\n<p>Before the boy could swallow what was going on, a chuckle could be heard near him. Before him, Good-Natured Spirit emerged, coiling around the Nalaq’s body were purple-colored living flames that hungrily tried to eat him whole.</p>\n<p>As carefree as he usually was, Good-Natured Spirit said with a grin, “Those Big-Boobed Sect girls sure are feisty. They’re escaping too fast, I can’t get you melons. I managed to get a feeling of their butts, though. Here, there’s some fragrant left behind.”</p>\n<p>Shira stepped back when the Nalaq offered his palm. It was still on fire, the boy didn’t want to get burn along with him. Besides, he didn’t want to get involved with the Nalaq’s deprived hobby.</p>\n<p>“Sure you don’t want it?” Good-Natured Spirit took a last sniff from his palm, followed by a low chuckle of his.</p>\n<p>“Good-Natured Spirit… what’s that fire?”</p>\n<p>“Yeah? Dunno, man. Exorcism flame or something.”</p>\n<p>“Ohh… oh, it’s very nice to know you up until know. Good bye.”</p>\n<p>“Hmm? You want to go somewhere?” Realizing the purple flame was getting annoying, Good-Natured Spirit then patted away the coiling flame from his shoulders like it was nothing.</p>\n<p>Shira shrugged his shoulders. It seemed this bastard Nalaq was too tough for that exorcism flame. Maybe the flame was too ordinary? Whatever, he didn’t care about that anymore. His eyes then swept the ruin around him. He said, “You can’t forget about the meeting for today. But please clean the mess you made yourself.”</p>\n<p>“That’s what you want for the chess reward?”</p>\n<p>Shira nodded.</p>\n<p>“Aye, aye, will do.” Good-Natured Spirit flicked his fingers, and human-sized paper cranes came out of thin air. They were obedient, not clear whether were monsters or just magical devices. The paper cranes used magnet-like magic to carry the messy uprooted trees and boulders, along with sweeping the dirt from the grass. The cleaning up might take a while, since the hill really was a mess. Shira, feeling a little light on the head, facepalming as he returned back to Yashura Family.</p>\n<p>The whole explosion could be heard from all over Badril Village. It wasn’t clear what its cause, but Yashura Family sent guards to prevent people from knowing what really happened. In Yashura Family’s guest hall, Patriarch Shuro Yashura, a few good Yashura Family elders, and the respected visitor, Sir Baront Staterwind, forming a circle as they sat cross-legged, discussing the explosion that had just occurred.</p>\n<p>“Good elders, Sir Patriarch Yashura, I know you must get excited when I said Young Master Shira has some talent in communicating with Nalaqs. However, a Nalaq still a Nalaq. You must not offend a Nalaq whatsoever, or the consequence is dire! Young Master Shira’s life is way more important than getting a qualification to enter my school!” Sir Baront Staterwind warned. His forehead was still wet with sweat, since he hurriedly ran to Yashura Family when he realized the direction of recent explosion.</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, you’re right, Sir Staterwind. Absolutely right! I already sent someone to check on my nephew’s condition, please calm down,” Patriarch Shuro said.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront shook his head. “You don’t really know what I’m trying to say, do you? You should prepare a very good healer or a doctor, Patriarch Shuro, because if it isn’t death, one can easily lose a limb over angering a Nalaq! That happens more often than you think!”</p>\n<p>The elders drew cold breaths in unison when they heard that. Patriarch Shuro, whose face already pale, becoming even whiter than a sheet of paper. If they boy lost a limb, Shira’s chance to succeed him as the next patriarch could be swept away like specks of dust.</p>\n<p>Yulong the Butler arrived. Everyone in the room had been anxiously waiting for him they instinctively stood up when Yulong approached.</p>\n<p>“Yulong, how’s Shira doing?” Patriarch Shuro asked.</p>\n<p>Yulong replied, “Young Master Shira is back, patriarch. But Madam Yashura sent him to the kitchen for a second breakfast.”</p>\n<p>“Breakfast? What’s a breakfast has something to do with that explosion? Can he still walk?”</p>\n<p>“He’s walking fine, Patriarch Yashura.”</p>\n<p>“Then, Yulong, please go fetch my nephew for me, we have something urgent to tell him!”</p>\n<p>After his trained elegant bow, Yulong stepped back and proceeded to do the task given to him.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront Staterwind peered at the butler’s back. He traveled southern lands many times, visiting many villages, yet, he seldom heard a Mossack descent major family employed western-style butler. What made him confused even more that Sir Kurusiya apparently knew the butler and gave his respect to him, which Sir Baront Staterwind didn’t expect that coming from the cold eastern Kaya swordsman.</p>\n<p>“Dear good elder,” Sir Baront Staterwind asked a random elder who sat beside him, “may I know why there’s a butler working here?”</p>\n<p>“Is Sir referring to Yulong? Yulong isn’t actually working for Yashura Family, but Young Master Shira’s mother’s attendant. I can’t tell you the details, so forgive me sir, all I can say is Young Master Shira’s father is exceedingly brave and awesome he managed to woo a respectable lady many years ago.”</p>\n<p>“Ahhh…” Sir Baront nodded. The boy apparently a result of his parent eloping. The Blue Robe Society expert of course knew etiquette to hold himself from digging the story further.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, Yulong came back with Shira followed behind. The boy wore new clothes since his previous one was dirty. When he saw the group of elders and the expert guest looking at him, Shira sighed inside his heart. He knew he had to clean Good-Natured Spirit’s mess once again.</p>\n<p>“Greetings, elders… greetings, uncle patriarch… greetings, Sir Staterwind…”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro impatiently treading forward. “Shira my boy, is it true that you lost your limbs?”</p>\n<p>“I’m unhurt, uncle, see?” Shira waved both of his hands to prove that his limbs still functioned as they should be.</p>\n<p>“Oh! God, thank God! Really! These are really your hands, aren’t they? Not a fake one made with wood?” Patriarch Shuro Yashura grabbed his nephew hands and waved it around like a child playing with flags.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira,” Sir Baront opened his mouth, “I reckon you failed to ask the Nalaq to meet me? If you can’t do it, young master, it best for you not to push him any further. Today, you offend him and he blast the hill behind your Yashura Family as a warning, but what happens if you make the same mistake tomorrow?”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro nodded at his words vigorously. “Sir Baront is right, Shira my boy. A Nalaq is a revered being ancient Mossacks worshiped as their guardian angel. The consequence of making them mad is very dire! You should know better, my boy, you should’ve told your uncle if a Nalaq came to you the first time!”</p>\n<p>Sir Baront and his uncle Patriarch Shuro had good intentions in telling him about how to be respectful to a Nalaq. But the more Shira heard their warning, the more he doubted about Good-Natured Spirit being a “revered” Nalaq like they said. Of course, saying the truth about the explosion’s true cause resulting only Yashura Family losing face in front of Sir Baront Staterwind. Shira had no choice, he had to tread the matter very carefully.</p>\n<p>“<em>Cough, cough</em>… Uncle, Sir Baront, thank you for your concern. Truth is, it wasn’t that the Nalaq being mad that causes the explosion, but there was some… accident… that happened right before.”</p>\n<p>“With what title do you usually call him, Young Master Shira?” Sir Baront asked.</p>\n<p>“As far as I know, he doesn’t have a title. At least he didn’t tell me if he ever had one. He told me to call him ‘Good-Natured Spirit’.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, with that kind of nickname, he must be a very benevolent person when he was alive,” Sir Baront concluded as he rubbed his beard. “So, Young Master Shira, it seems he didn’t really intent to blast into smithereens.”</p>\n<p>Shira nodded. That part was true. Instead, someone else happened to be intending to blast this Nalaq into smithereens.</p>\n<p>“Thank God! Thank God! If he is a good Nalaq, maybe we don’t need to throw the second ngajen ceremony for this month, after all!” Patriarch Shuro Yashura exclaimed. The elders in the guest hall followed his exclaiming by handclapping and joyful cries. Ngajen ceremony only held once a month so the village safe from angry Selaqs, no one ever tried it to protect themselves from intelligent Nalaqs. Since the village was founded, the locals never had a Nalaq dwelling there. So it was natural for the elders to worry about throwing a ceremony they didn’t know working or not. Ngajen ceremony was expensive, after all.</p>\n<p>The more Shira saw how the previous tense hall turned jubilant and full of relieved faces, the more awkward he became. That Nalaq might call himself ‘Good-Natured Spirit’, yet he was anything but good. A low-life spirit who no doubt had been using the invisibility traits of spirits to commit many deprived crimes. He was closer to evil spirit incarnation than a good-natured one. The misunderstanding was too great his face twisted as if he’d just taste a sour lemon.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront Staterwind said, “Still, since he seems reluctant to use his old name, I reckon the Nalaq that approaching you is a low-tier one, Young Master Shira. Low-tier Nalaqs usually spirits that gain consciousness merely by luck. They don’t have factions backing them, and fortunately--in my experience--it easier to initiate negotiation with unaffiliated Nalaqs.” A hint of pride then flashed through his eyes, he continued, “my disciples will arrive tomorrow morning. One of them contracted with a high-tier Nalaq. Since the Nalaq’s mood turned sour is partly my fault, with help from the Nalaq contracted with one of my disciples, I will ask him to leave Yashura Family peacefully!”</p>\n<p>“Sir Staterwind is wise! Thank you for your concern, Sir!” Patriarch Shuro sang praises toward this expert. The elders of Yashura Family followed suit.</p>\n<p>“As expected of such expert!”</p>\n<p>“Sir Staterwind is the best of bunch of all experts that I know all my life!”</p>\n<p>“Hurray for Sir Staterwind!”</p>\n<p>They circling Sir Baront Staterwind and, not long after that, someone started to prostate. They behaved as if the guest was their one and only savior. Even Shira was getting embarrassed from seeing the scene, not to mention the already flushing Baront Staterwind.</p>\n<p>When everyone getting carried away, Shira slipped out after excusing himself. He knew he was no match for the Yashura Family’s older generations’ shamelessness. Upon walking outside, he saw Yulong was standing by the hall’s door looking galant as usual with his butler professionalism.</p>\n<p>“Can you please try to stop my uncle, Yulong? Sir Staterwind is started to get uncomfortable there.”</p>\n<p>Yulong glanced at the whole mess inside, and then he said to his young master, “I think it’s not everyday an expert coming to Yashura Family, young master, so let’s count this as Patriarch Yashura to gaining favors from a foreign expert.”</p>\n<p>“Are they really okay, though?”</p>\n<p>Yulong smiled.</p>\n<p>“Of course they aren’t, young master. But Patriarch Shuro and the family elders are honest people. Although sometimes they can be overwhelming, I’m sure Sir Staterwind can see no falsehood in their words.”</p>\n<p>Shira looked at those elders inside once again. The more he saw, the more he realized that those hysterical village men calling a man they barely knew these past two days a savior by no means a lie from their part. The elders really were freaking out when they heard the explosion. And Patriarch Shuro Yashura was the most worried of the bunch, considering him a patriarch and an uncle. Thinking about it all again, Shira couldn’t really say he still embarrassed seeing the elders spewing exaggerated flattering with straight faces.</p>\n<p>“Sir Staterwind comes from a respectable sect. Someone like that won’t get to travel the southern lands if he didn’t know the nature of the local people. So it best not to worry about it too much, young master,” Yulong said.</p>\n<p>“Really… ah, speaking of sects,” Shira deliberately changed the topic, “I heard from someone that one of the major families in Badril Village hosts members of a certain sect in secret. You’re from outside, Yulong--do you think something so outrageous like that could happen?”</p>\n<p>“Some older sects have long reaching influence, but I don’t think anyone would be interested to plant their own in Badril Village. There’s nothing valuable here for them to take notice.”</p>\n<p>“As I thought. It’s just unthinkable to think some secret powers lurking beneath our everyday lives. What if some experts actually pretending to be servants here in Yashura Family?”</p>\n<p>Although it wasn’t noticeable, Yulong’s smile became stiff.</p>\n<p>“You jest, young master. If that was true, do you think your uncle and the elders can take that kind of truth?”</p>\n<p>Following Yulong’s gaze, Shira peeped the hall and saw Sir Baront’s awkward figure, where he was in the center of Yashura Family elites--all of them-- who passionately prostrating in the floor. They practically worshipping him now.</p>\n<p>“You’re right…” Shira could only hide his face with his palm. Just when he thought he could understand them, the boy then wished he didn’t know these shameless men.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>As far as the current generation of Badril Village locals knew, they never got visited by nobles until this month Malikh Family’s ngajen ceremony happened. Everyone still talking about it.</p>\n<p>Young Master of Blackwood Family only stayed in Badril Village in one day. And the noble carriage of Blackwood Family set off out of Badril Village by noon. The next morning after the day he was gone, the two foreign guests who had been staying in Malikh Family, Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia, felt overstaying might be unnecessary, thus decided to leave too.</p>\n<p>Because the carriages going out from Badril Village mostly for public transports, Bhela personally asked an elder from his father’s faction who had a horse carriage to give her guests a ride to the nearest town, where they’d later book a private carriage for them to return home. Mister Harrington, as an unsocial bachelor as he always was, was waiting in the carriage for Madame Sylvia to say her parting words to Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>“You have a very bright future, Young Lady Bhela. A girl with limitless potential. So your favor will become very valuable as you mature,” Madame Sylvia said. “If you need something, you can always send letters to my sect. Don’t hold back. Just think about this of us making an investment.”</p>\n<p>Since Bhela a smart girl anyway, Madame Sylvia decided not to make her words fancy and told her in a straightforward manner. Bhela appreciated her honesty, and said her thanks.</p>\n<p>The carriage then set off. In the main gate of Badril Village, the guards on duty witnessed the recently blazing popular Young Lady Bhela Malikh bowing her body as she sent off two foreigners in traveling clothes made from expensive linen.</p>\n<p>“Look at how she is,” inside the carriage, Madame Sylvia said to Mister Harrington. “She’s a pretty sensible girl, don’t you think?”</p>\n<p>“She is,” Mister Harrington said softly, almost a murmur.</p>\n<p>It was hard to start a conversation whenever Mister Harrington sat with his arms crossed tightly. Madame Sylvia could see that he wasn’t exactly happy with the outcome regarding Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>There was no bandits lurking around, and no monsters occasionally came out, proved that the lands around Badril Village actually well-protected--too well, perhaps, for a rural village without a major power backing them. Their journey was smooth without disturbance. Thirty minutes after they left Badril Village, they encountered another carriage painted with black-jet color. The black carriage was well-decorated with golden-colored plates, obviously elites or nobles were traveling inside.</p>\n<p>However, unlike common nobles who liked to hide in the carriage to show-off their elegance and aloofness, this carriage simply out of commonsense. To talk about how weird this carriage was there was a need to point out the refreshing greenness of the view around. Despite there being a road far away from settlement, hint of liveliness from bird chirping--along with croaking frogs from nearby streams and singing insects--completed the idyllic road with a strange harmony that invited light-hearted person to sing along with lively nature. That was exactly what the noble in the black carriage doing. A young lady with a very girly and childish feature was carefreely sitting in the window in spite of pale servants begging her to sit still. She completely dumb about the servants’ pleas. And with her personality, nobody knew whether she was pretending or not. The only thing that the jubilant Lyla Blackwood cared about was singing an off-tune song about her befriending village frogs and bunnies.</p>\n<p>“Prepare your life you frogs and bunnies~</p>\n<p>Cause I’m not letting you go before we become the best of buddies~~</p>\n<p>Wait for me you birdies and kitties~~</p>\n<p>Cause we’re about to become the best of all buddies~~ yuhuu~ yuhuu~~</p>\n<p>The best buddies in this lifetime~~ yuhuuuu~~~”</p>\n<p>There was nothing the servants and the guards could do to stop their young lady from singing this amazingly ugly song about her future exploits in Badril Village. Seeing that another carriage approaching, the horse-riding guards did their best to block the view to the crest planted on the carriage’s compartment. Their effort to save faces from the young lady’s mishap was futile, however, since the other party happened to know Lyla.</p>\n<p>“How many times have I told you to stay away from windows, Lyla!”</p>\n<p>“Whu--what? Who?” Lyla was surprised. But then she was elated to see a familiar face. “Is that you, Instructor Sylvia? You here to train Sis Bhela’s archery again?”</p>\n<p>“Get down from the window!” Madame Sylvia raised her voice.</p>\n<p>“I’m also here to meet Sis Bhela!” Lyla also raised her voice cheerfully.</p>\n<p>“Lyla, you won’t be able to get married in the future if you’re always act like this!” Madame Sylvia warned her. She long dropped title of Young Lady Blackwood when talking to this naughty girl.</p>\n<p>“Um!” Lyla nodded. “But which one do you like more, Instructor Sylvia, bunnies or kitties?” It was no use trying to talk sense to Lyla. Any warning only come to her right ear and gone out straight from the left one.</p>\n<p>“Stay away from the windows!!!” Madame Sylvia screamed until her voice shrilled.</p>\n<p>Lyla also screamed, “Good morning to you too!!!”</p>\n<p>Both carriages drifted apart after the brief encounter. It ended with Lyla happily waved her hands happily. Madame Sylvia sighed and shook her head. That girl was so naughty that the troubles she created made the seminars’ managements even considered to drop her once during the seminars. Only after Bhela Malikh convinced them she’d take care of Lyla they finally did let go the matter.</p>\n<p>Before, the black carriage of Blackwood Family came to Badril Village in the shroud of night’s darkness, so nobody noticed their elegance and the aura of expensive carriage blazing through the village road--of which was surprisingly wide for a settlement road, unlike road of cities in the western kingdoms, because long ago Mossack people needed to endure monster stampedes passing through their villages once every few months.</p>\n<p>“Mom, look, is that a noble?” a snotty kid pointing out the carriage.</p>\n<p>The mother hurriedly pulled her child. “Ssuuussh! Keep your finger to yourself! Don’t you know what happened to peasants that make noble angry from the stories they always talking about?”</p>\n<p>The steel-armored guards who escort the carriage scoffed them in disdain. Contrast with the escorts’ attitudes, Lyla waved her hand at them, while shouting, “Hey boy, don’t you think bunnies are cute as the kitties? Or do you like cats more?”</p>\n<p>The kid didn’t answer. He instead forced to bow by her mother and let the carriage went through silently. The villagers didn’t have the experience in receiving nobles, most of them--except for those who attended the ngajen ceremony in Malikh Family--had never saw nobles in their lives. Because of that they were awkward and didn’t know what to do.</p>\n<p>Lyla didn’t seem to mind their stiffness. Instead, she vigorously greeted everyone she saw from the window she sat on.</p>\n<p>“Good day! Good morning! I’m here to sleepover at Sis Bhela’s place! Do you know where Sis Bhela lives?”</p>\n<p>Back in Elzhier Family, in the main family’s house, their patriarch, hurriedly changed his clothes to a formal one he always used every ngajen ceremony.</p>\n<p>“Hurry, hurry! As the head of this village, how can I let a noble arriving without me receiving them?!”</p>\n<p>Not even he yet buttoned his shirt properly, the Village Head sprinted toward the main street, only to see the crowd of onlookers already dispersed and still talking about the scary nobles they always heard in stories were actually <em>weirdly</em> friendly.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Bhela Malikh was already notified about Lyla Blackwood’s arrival. She waited on a chair at the Malikh Family’s gate, drinking a fresh young coconut water occasionally. The black carriage finally was in her view. And the young girl she was waiting for happily waved her hand at her. From the window.</p>\n<p>“Carefull, Lyla!” Bhela yelled as she sprang from her chair.</p>\n<p>“Huuupp!” Lyla Blackwood simply didn’t want to waste anytime leaving the carriage through the door. So she simply jumped from the window she sat upon, before the carriage even stopped. It was fortunate that amongst Bhela’s skill as a Unique Class, she had <b>Haste</b>, which boosted her speed in short duration. She used that to catch Lyla before she hurt herself. The young noble girl landed splendidly in Bhela’s arm.</p>\n<p>“What’s this, Sistah?” Lyla’s eyes sparkled when she saw Bhela get a young coconut in her other hand. She was completely oblivious she just did something dangerous.</p>\n<p>“Young coconut. There’s still some of its water left. Here, try this,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“For me? Really?”</p>\n<p>“Drink slowly…”</p>\n<p><em>Glug glug glug</em>. Lyla drank the coconut in anything but in slowly manner. She even burped shamelessly.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Lyla, ah!” the butler who coming with her was in horror seeing how Young Lady Lyla Blackwood made a horrible mess by spilling the coconut water on her expensive, silk woven black dress. Only an equally expensive silk handkerchief worthy enough to wipe his young lady’s noble dress!</p>\n<p>“I told you to drink slowly…” Bhela said. She used her sleeve to wipe Lyla’s wet face, and then proceeded to also wipe Lyla’s dress.</p>\n<p>“Y-young miss!” the butler shouted in panic. His body jolted as soon as he saw the outrageous act of spoiling the young noble’s dress by making it contacted with commoner clothes. That was heresy! He needed her to stop before she contained Blackwood’s expensive dress with her commoner’s bacteria!</p>\n<p>“You need something?” Bhela looked at this unfamiliar butler of Blackwood Family. Her expressionless face judged the butler coldly.</p>\n<p>“My name is Tim, young miss--please use this!” the butler offered a silky smooth handkerchief with Blackwood Family’s crest embroidered on the surface. The handkerchief was actually the butler’s, was awarded to his great-great-great grandfather by the then Baron Blackwood for some sort of achievement that practically nobody was still alive to remember. Everytime Butler Tim met a new person, he’d make an excuse to show off this particular handkerchief. Today was no exception. It was his most precious handkerchief. Just from the look of it one could tell how crazy expensive it was.</p>\n<p>“Ah, ah… my nose… aahhh--” Lyla felt her nose was wet and itchy, “--ahhtchii!!!”</p>\n<p>“You’ve got a flu?” Bhela asked worriedly.</p>\n<p>“Yeah. Aunt Jiji told me to drink my medicine everyday but it’s so bitter. So much bitter that it’s evil!”</p>\n<p>“Where’s your medicine now?”</p>\n<p>“Oh. I throw it away last night.”</p>\n<p>Bhela shook her head.</p>\n<p>“That’s no good. You can’t throw away your medicine like that. Now, wipe your nose. This mister butler said to use this…” she put the handkerchief on Lyla’s nose, and Lyla blew her nose on it.</p>\n<p>Lyla gave back the handkerchief to Butler Tim. “Thank you, Sir Butler. It’s very helpful of you.”</p>\n<p>The butler received back his most precious handkerchief. Bonus Lyla’s snot.</p>\n<p>“Come on inside,” Bhela said to Lyla. “Even if the water runs dry, coconuts still have meat we can scoop. After that we’ll pick some star fruits that I planted since I was a child.”</p>\n<p>“Star fruits! Woohooo!”</p>\n<p>The girls then walked inside. Lyla was so excited she didn’t leave her friend, hanging on her neck like a koala being comfortable on a tree branch. The stories about a noble young lady coming to Malikh Family for Bhela Malikh spread amongst the maidservants like oil being poured on an open wildfire. The Malikhs couldn’t describe the pride seeing their eldest young lady with a blue blood friend. Especially the aunties. They watched how close Bhela and Lyla with teary eyes and happy smiles.</p>\n<p>“Young lady is… finally… finally…”</p>\n<p>“She finally has a friend…”</p>\n<p>“Huuu… huuu… merciful Goddesses finally saw the young lady’s plight and blessed her with a real friend… huuu huuuu….”</p>\n<p>Nobody more happier than the aunties who were familiar with how their Young Lady Bhela lived her live. They silently cried watching their young lady, who usually alone and unapproachable, finally grown up and had her first friend in these past ten years.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Butler Tim grimaced inside. Despite the fact that he was tasked to win over Bhela Malikh with any means necessary, he didn’t like this girl. It wasn’t because his handkerchief got dirty--well, maybe he resented her for it a little--it because the girl named Bhela Malikh wasn’t acting as a young country girl supposed to act. Country bumpkins supposed to falter when they saw the radiance seeped out of the nobles’ aura, they supposed to tremble when they saw the noble wealth glittering beneath the sun. But this girl was indifferent and aloof. She was cold but the coldness paired with concise and elegant mannerism. Butler Tim knew she trying to act noble herself. That was why he didn’t like her.</p>\n<p>However, Butler Tim was a smart person. Any smart person would wear a perfect smile despite his heart bleeding over the snot on his precious handkerchief. Before leaving the city, the butler didn’t forget to look for a gift he’d use to lower the Malikh Family’s guard. He heard the previous gift was rejected, and when he asked for the content of the gift, the smart Butler Tim shook his head as if he knew it would happen.</p>\n<p>Toward country bumpkins, too expensive gifts would never work. He knew this because he was smart. And because he was smart, he knew better gifts. Not-so-expensive gifts worked for country bumpkins.</p>\n<p>Therefore, he presented Bhela Malikh with popular city biscuits.</p>\n<p>“I heard this biscuit is currently very popular among noble young ladies. This butler happened to pass by a store that sold this, so I reckon Young Lady Bhela might love to taste some.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, because the elders roughly knew the Blackwood Family’s youngest lady would come to visit, two leaders of opposing factions came to watch how their Young Lady Bhela would receive the noble guest. Elder Jhamil was all smiling because he liked what he saw. But the expression of Elder Khasim turned sour when he saw how the butler of Blackwood Family tried to butter up to Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>“Don’t accept it, young lady, please….” Elder Khasim whispered under his breath. Of course, there was no single soul heard what he just said. He was worried the hard work to rebuild his faction’s morale all would turn into dust if people thought their spiritual mascot, the one and only Young Lady Bhela Malikh, could be bought with mere biscuits.</p>\n<p>Contrary to what Elder Khasim hoped, Bhela Malikh received the gift without even putting a second thought. A feeling of defeat surged inside him. Elder Jhamil looked at his rival with a mocking glance.</p>\n<p>After receiving the snacks, Bhela excused herself and brought Lyla with her to stroll around Malikh Family’s gardens. Butler Tim pretended to wave his hand and smiled, but inside, he was gloating at how hypocrite Bhela was. His guess that Young Lady Bhela wouldn’t refuse the gift he brought was entirely correct. Before, he deliberately said the biscuit was noble young ladies’ favorite. Thus, according to his smart logic, as long as it wasn’t too expensive that it’d scare this fake young lady, no way a noble wannabe would reject this kind of gifts.</p>\n<p>“Heh,” Butler Tim scoffed when Bhela and Lyla already left. “Bet you’ve never eaten any city biscuits your entire life, haven’t you.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, Bhela Malikh hadn’t had any city biscuits her entire life. Not before and also not today. What Butler Tim didn’t know was that the snacks he bought with his own money ultimately ended up returned to Blackwood Family--to be exact, it ended up inside Lyla Blackwood’s belly. Bhela couldn’t help but received the biscuits when, beside her, she saw Lyla was drooling looking at the biscuits.</p>\n<p>The elders led by Elder Jhamil then respectfully welcomed the butler along with servants and guards from Blackwood Family. From the impression alone, Butler Tim could see reasons for him to like this slick-tongued Elder Jhamil. He knew how to flatter and also he knew how to act humble in front of people with higher status than him. Not like that noble-wannabe Young Lady of Malikh Family. This Elder Jhamil knew that he was only a country bumpkin thus acted accordingly. Naturally, the smart Butler Tim was pleased.</p>\n<p>And so began Butler Tim’s quests to swallow Malikh Family with his smartly planned schemes and cunning political games.</p>\n<p>In mere hours, the neutral elders who hadn’t joined either both rivalling factions began flocking to Elder Jhamil’s side. One part because they wanted to side with the faction that had the noble support and another part simply because Elder Jhamil, with the help of Butler Tim, had been throwing around sweet deals over all directions.</p>\n<p>“Only one tenth of the elder council members don’t want to pick a side by now, but their number is too significant to be an obstacle for Sir Butler’s great plan,” Elder Jhamil reported the current situation to Butler Tim.</p>\n<p>The butler was enjoying a glass of tea served by the maid that supposed to serve Young Lady Lyla Blackwood as if he was the visiting noble himself. He nodded. “I see. With this, the first stage of my plan has been completed.”</p>\n<p>“Oohhh!” Elder Jhamil exclaimed. “Sir Butler summoned rain and fire by flipping Malikh Family’s political scene upside down, and this is only the first stage?! As expected, the Butler of Blackwood Family is very smart!”</p>\n<p>Butler Tim originally wanted to act aloof and sophisticated before he visited this rural village. However, upon being called a smart person, he couldn’t help but grinned widely. “Oho, you’re an interesting fella, aren’t you? Very well, since you’ve done a good job yourself, I won’t be so petty to grab all the credit. Tell me how I should do next, if I like what I hear, we might as well corporate your thoughts into my plan.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was excited. How could he not? An opportunity to rise beyond a mere elder of rural village was laid before him.</p>\n<p>“Sir Butler, you may not know this, but we Mossack people regard having a good meal very highly. Everytime we’re having breakfast or dinner together as the entire family, even though we’re always looked peaceful outside, those trivial events actually are a political battlefield for us elders to extend our influence! This lowly man himself used a few move in the past during breakfast to gather like-minded men under my banner. I used all my resources and connections in a single mealtime to attack my rivals! However, these past two days, my biggest rival used a lowly method against me…”</p>\n<p>“Oh? What did he do?” Butler Tim asked.</p>\n<p>“He didn’t do much,” Elder Jhamil said, sneering when he was talking about this rival of his, “all he did was inviting Young Lady Bhela everytime we were having a meal in the family hall. He’s been a stubborn and ignorant supporter of main family, but this time he actually knew how to use his connection with the main family to deal a blow against me. A few of the elders had been faltering when they saw Young Lady Bhela leaning over the other side; I’m afraid if we’re leaving this ignorant rival of me doing as he wanted, there’s gonna be a hole in Sir Butler’s smart plan!”</p>\n<p>Butler Tim swirled the tea in his cup as though he was deep in thought. Of course, if this proven to endanger his smart plan, the butler couldn’t sit still watching all that happened. “I heard the Mossacks are peculiar people, but I don’t know you Mossack people have a strange custom!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, we’re living here far away from the city, so of course our traditions might seem unsophisticated to wise westerners like Sir Butler,” Elder Jhamil fawned.</p>\n<p>“Then what do you suggest Blackwood Family should do in this situation, Elder Jhamil?”</p>\n<p>“It’s easy!” Elder Jhamil was so excited he almost jumped from his seat. “My rival faction used Young Lady Bhela to gain foothold, and we can also use that to deal a greater blow back to them!”</p>\n<p>“And that is?”</p>\n<p>“Of course, we can use--I mean, we can invite young noble miss to a dinner together with us. With this we can unofficially announce our alliance with Blackwood Family! It’s the final nail to main family’s faction!”</p>\n<p>Even though Bhela Malikh’s status as a Unique Class shone throughout all of Badril Village, her name still fall short with a pure noble like Lyla Blackwood. Madam back in Blackwood Family used her daughter so Blackwood could infiltrate Malikh Family easily, but that didn’t mean Lyla still wasn’t as useful.</p>\n<p>“Very well. Let us go with that,” then he asked the maid responsible for Lyla’s schedule. “What was Young Lady Lyla doing this afternoon?”</p>\n<p>The maid replied, “Young Lady Bhela Malikh carried her around to play. At first, they went to Malikh Family’s orchard to pick some fruits. Then they visited the sick Patriarch Malikh in his room for a few minutes. After that, they went outside to stroll and came back with a new rabbit pet they bought from other family. Finally, when the sun is setting, they went to the kitchen to watch the servants cooking.”</p>\n<p>“How uncouth for a noble young lady being led around in dirty places like that,” Butler Tim was displeased, but nothing he could do since making Bhela’s attention elsewhere meant he could move freely to make a trap for her. Nodding to himself, the butler then gave an instruction to the maid, “you go to Young Lady Lyla and tell that Malikh Family invite her for a dinner.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was excitedly rubbing his hands when Butler Tim said that. Finally, payback to those imbecile Elder Khasim!</p>\n<p>“But, Butler Tim…” the maid hesitated.</p>\n<p>“What is it?”</p>\n<p>“Malikh Family already invited Young Lady Lyla to have dinner. She’s eating in Malikh Family’s hall right now….”</p>\n<p>“Hmm, what do you mean?”</p>\n<p>What the maid meant was that someone in Malikh Family already brought Lyla to have dinner with them.</p>\n<p>When Butler Tim playing political games and scheming around in Malikh Family, Bhela Malikh, along with the elders friendly with Elder Khasim, had been giving bunch of candies and food for Lyla Blackwood, much more than the biscuits Butler Tim brought with him. Being a great foodie herself, Lyla never had enough, the first day in Malikh Family she ate more sweets and foods worth of one week back in Blackwood Family’s manor. Aunt Jiji and other Blackwood Family’s maid servants would freak out if they saw how glutton Lyla currently was.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the news that the main family’s faction hosting a dinner for a noble miss swept Malikh Family like a thunderstorm. The neutral elders Elder Jhamil had just bought flocking back toward Elder Khasim’s side. It was so sudden. Everyone wasn’t even got a breath to process what had happened. And this for sure was an unprecedented move ever since Patriarch Ghalim suddenly fell ill and retreated from the political scene.</p>\n<p>Just as one side was busy completing the first stage to win over the Young Lady of Malikh Family, the other side already won over Young Lady of the noble Blackwood Family. All happened in a span of a single day.</p>\n<p>“Y-young Lady Lyla…”</p>\n<p>Even Butler Tim couldn’t pull his own young miss seeing how happy she was. His plan had been jabbed in a completely unexpected way. Maybe he wasn’t so smart after all.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>It was unfortunate that Madam Malikh didn’t see the Young Noble Miss of Blackwood Family kindly. Even though the girl did nothing wrong, Madam Malikh wasn’t so muddled that she wasn’t aware what Blackwood Family and those corrupt elders conspiring against her husband and Malikh’s main family. Even Bhela herself couldn’t do anything to change her mother’s mind.</p>\n<p>However, Lyla Blackwood, an airhead as she always was, was oblivious of the hostility directed toward her.</p>\n<p>It was morning the second day Lyla in Badril Village. Following her friend Bhela, she carried a little box inside Patriarch Ghalim’s bedroom. This little box filled with custom-made medicines--most were amateurly mixed from two different trivial medicines, consisted of remedies for flu and headache. Nothing harmful but nothing useful at the same time. And just like yesterday, to pay for Bhela parents’ kindness for letting her staying in Malikh Family, Lyla Blackwood decided to play doctor a little bit.</p>\n<p>“Uncle, I’m coming again to help you feel better,” Lyla said as she dragged a chair and sat beside Patriarch Ghalim’s sick bed. Seeing the pale middle-aged man in bed, she blinked her googly eyes, then continued, “how’s yesterday medicine I gave you. Are you feeling a tiny minny bit better, perhaps?”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim certainly was feeling better these past few days, not because Lyla’s medicines, but Grandpa Piss’s diagnosis and remedies. Toward this girl, he weakly nodded. “Thank you for your help, little lady.”</p>\n<p>“Then I’m going to fed you my newest recipe, uncle. Here, here, open your mouth.”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghamil did what he was told. Because Lyla didn’t like bitter medicine, she added lots of brown sugar. Lots and lots of brown sugar.</p>\n<p>“It’s… sweet.”</p>\n<p>“Are you feeling better, now?” Lyla asked.</p>\n<p>“Yes, little lady, I’m feeling better.”</p>\n<p>As a matter of fact, he wasn’t. The medicine was more like a candy than remedy.</p>\n<p>“Good! If you eat this three times a day, maybe your illness would go away, uncle,” Lyla then sternly pointed out, “maybe!”</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh was nervous when her husband consumed the strange medicine Lyla gave him, but she didn’t open her mouth to protest. Bhela was changing the pillows’ sheet nearby, and doing some other chores that usually were done by the servants. In the meantime, Lyla was giving advice for Patriarch Ghalim liked how he should eat moderately three times a day, how he should brush his teeth after he ate sweets, and all the things Aunt Jiji told Lyla all the time.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to visit again, uncle, get well soon!” Lyla waved her hands. Carrying a broom in her hands, Lyla’s next schedule was following Bhela doing chores in the courtyard.</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim weakly waved his hand back. Of course, after the girls were already gone, he noticed his bitter wife biting her lips indignantly.</p>\n<p>“Don’t stare the girl so much. She’s not responsible for her family’s wrongdoings. It’s not like a girl her age knows what her parents do behind the scene.”</p>\n<p>“Why did you eat that? What if they used her to give you more poison?”</p>\n<p>“Bhela wouldn’t let me have the medicine if she didn’t what it was, no? Stop putting that kind of face, you only make our daughter feels awkward about all this.”</p>\n<p>The woman held her husband’s hand, kissing it with her forehead as she hid her face. She whispered, “Oh, don’t you know how hurt this heart holding back my grievance? Why did our daughter had to bring someone from that family inside our roof?” she sniffed, “how long this farce gonna last? What should I do in the mean time? Oh! I don’t know! I don’t know!”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim sighed as he witnessed his wife cried helplessly.</p>\n<p>In the courtyard, near the coops where Malikh Family raised chickens and ducks, Lyla was squatting in front of the new bunny she and Bhela bought just yesterday. She was waiting the whole morning just to feed this bunny. The bunny hopped around, itching to play in spite it couldn’t resist the temptation of delicious green leaves, again and again. Wathing how glutton the bunny was, Lyla found herself immerse in immense joy. She very much envying the life of a bunny. Perhaps that because she could relate to how it spent its day without worry; eating, playing, sleeping, then playing again--a life that she longed to have. If only she was born a rabbit instead of a young lady of noble family….</p>\n<p>The sound of the broom swept the ground took away her attention. Lyla couldn’t understand how a daughter of a patriarch like Bhela had to work so much.</p>\n<p>“Why do you work so much, Sistah?” Lyla asked when she found out there still much dry leaves Bhela had to sweep. “Won’t you get bored soon? Just let the servants clean this place.”</p>\n<p>Bhela, sweeping as if Lyla’s idleness didn’t bother her the slightest, replied, “Here in Badril Village, everyone who hasn’t done their coming of age ceremony has to do chores for their parents. It doesn’t matter if it’s the farmer’s daughter or the biggest family’s young lady, helping the matter of the household is one of the seven virtues we Mossack people get to do for our parents.”</p>\n<p>Originally, Lyla wanted her friend also playing with the bunny. But hearing Bhela just said something serious, there was no way she’d reveal her intention now. “My mom always nagging me to go to dance lesson or whatever. It’s very very boring,” she murmured, a bit dejected.</p>\n<p>“The west and the south have different values,” Bhela said. “Complete your virtue for your parents then you’ll grow to be a fine lady, Lyla.”</p>\n<p>“Uggghhh…” Lyla grunted as she didn’t want to continue the topic any further. She long developed a sense for her own survival to detect whether or not the conversation ended up she being forced to do some boring stuff. Knowing Bhela’s personality, Lyla knew soon Sis Bhela’d make her doing chores too. Grabbing the bunny, Lyla quickly escaped somewhere else so that she could spend her time playing. Bhela shook her head seeing the girl’s behavior.</p>\n<p>Bhela then noticed some servants whispering while they looking at Lyla from the distance. Many people were curious what a noble young lady like her would do in a rural place like this, and Bhela wasn’t that oblivious not to notice the eyes planted by the elders of Malikh Family.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, she then saw four girls dressed in expensive garments approaching Lyla with their mouth covered with feathered fans in their hands. Their clothing looked as if they attending some sort of ceremony, while in fact, they calculated that this kind of appearance was the most suitable for them to socialize with a girl of blue-blooded origin. Bhela recognized the leader of those girls was actually Elder Jhamil’s niece.</p>\n<p>“Have you read Le Armour dan Varoza written by Leornador De Gonzalez, Young Lady Blackwood?”</p>\n<p>“Ah, yes, that piece was adequately sophisticated but I think Vista van Gracious’s omnibus more than adequate, le banjour?”</p>\n<p>“I see, I see, their pieces adequately well-written as those senor themselves adequattely live as maestro. But perhaps equoliette more than fit the diagram as paradigm sensorita abligioate senor des adequately le banjour.”</p>\n<p>“But of course, Young Lady Blackwood is more addequately sophisitacted as it’s a noblesse obligiote to be more sohpisitacated than us village senioritas. Perhaps le banjour is fortuna with de gracious by Young Lady’s great wisdom?”</p>\n<p>Lyla blinked her eyes trying to decipher whatever these girls mean. The bunny in her arms even escaped amidst her confusion.</p>\n<p>“Uhh… uhhh…” Lyla timidly stepped back from the feathered fan girls. “I think Sis Bhela is calling me…”</p>\n<p>She swiftly ran away back to her friend Bhela.</p>\n<p>“Sistah, Sistah Bhela!” Lyla cried and grabbing Bhela’s sloven sleeve tightly, demanding for justice, “they came to bully me!”</p>\n<p>“What did they do?” Bhela asked.</p>\n<p>“They know I can’t speak western language! They came to test me! They’re even worse than those rich girls in seminar--they jumble some western mumbo jumbo into plain language in order to confuse me! They must be laughing and call me stupid by now!”</p>\n<p>Hearing Lyla’s grievance, Bhela patted her head in order to let the girl calmed down.</p>\n<p>“Lyla, those girls are different than the noble girls that always making fun of you.”</p>\n<p>“Different? How so?”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at the girls who also was watching them back while fanning themselves with their fabulous feathered fans.</p>\n<p>“They looked like noble descendants, but actually were not.”</p>\n<p>“I still don’t like them nonetheless!”</p>\n<p>“You don’t have to talk to them if you don’t want to,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>Yet Lyla still restlessly tugging Bhela’s sleeves, making it harder for her to do her chores. Before the peers that always making fun of her, Lyla was always helpless and had been depending on Bhela’s figure as a shield. What it looked like from the point of view of an outsider was a scene where a young mother being tested of her patience dealing with a girl who was throwing a tantrum.</p>\n<p>Seeing that the young noble miss wouldn’t come back soon, the feathered fan girls approaching Bhela and Lyla instead.</p>\n<p>“Oh, fancy to meet Young Lady Bhela here, le banjour!”</p>\n<p>“Le bonjour…” Bhela hesitated to reply back. Tilting her head slightly, she studied the pompously dressed girls before her. These girls were relatives of Malikh Family’s elders. None of them could match with Bhela if talking strictly about social status wise, not to mention talents. However, while she was holding her broom, it looked like Bhela was the one with common origin, while these girls were floating swans who happened to be generous enough to greet plebeians with their <em>unique</em> vocabulary.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Lyla Blackwood hid behind Lyla’s back. Despite a noble origin herself, meeting more cocky and fake young ladies than the girls before her were rare experience for Lyla.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela, fancy to meet you. Good morning. The weather is nice. I eat snails everyday,” Elder Jhamil’s niece took the lead and said that with a hint of inflated pride.</p>\n<p>Bhela narrowed her eyes. She could see why Lyla instantly hated these girls. She then said in a sleek foreign language, “Je ne sais pas de quoi tu parles. Si vous ne parlez pas une langue étrangère, fermez simplement la bouche, sinon vous faites peur aux enfants avec votre non-sens.”</p>\n<p>The feathered fan girls blinked their eyes trying to decipher whatever Bhela had said.</p>\n<p>“Oh, it turns out Young Lady Bhela is aquadettely know some le banjour!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, Young Lady Bhela is adequately sophisticated after all. Me gusta!”</p>\n<p>“I see, I see, le pasta fortuna is delicosaza.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s niece didn’t say anything as she only maintained a sweet smile while being nervous herself. Racking her brains over remembering the contents of thick dictionary, she tried to form a decent sentences in foreign language. But Bhela then cut off her train of thought before she could say a word.</p>\n<p>“Blackwood Family is migrating noble that has long been making their roots here in southern land. Hundred of years living far away from their western peers, noble families like this would naturally become more lax. It’s natural for Lyla to not mastering her homeland’s native tongue.”</p>\n<p>Bhela said that in a straight manner. That was a white lie, however. It was true that many noble families coming from the western side of Tiramikal Continent to forgot their western root and began to see themselves as southerners. But those were usually the case depending right circumstances, like exiled nobles, or some young masters who had lost in political battle branched out and fancied themselves a legit noble family with themselves at the helm. Blackwood Family weren’t exiled nobles, and though Lyla’s ancestors branching out some hundreds of years ago, that didn’t automatically made them cutting off ties with the original family. The main family of Blackwood was back in a western country called Tatalghia Kingdom, still sending letters and envoys from time to time to the branch Lyla was living in--although, undeniably, the southern branch of Blackwood Family had long developed and surpassed the main one.</p>\n<p>It seemed like Bhela already used to tell this lie. Anyone who heard this would be forced to accept it, unless they wanted to spend time and resources digging through the details--which to be honest, none of these pompous young girls were willing or simply unable to go through.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Elder Jhamil’s niece believed Lyla’s family exempt her to excel in foreign language. Yet she was still displeased inside. Her uncle told her that Bhela had been hogging the young noble’s influence for herself, everyone in Malikh Family already knew how Bhela Malikh carrying around the noble young lady yesterday. So what if she had some more bit of talent and had been running around overseas in that whatever seminars she was attending? A bumpkin origin wouldn’t be able to change their bumpkin bloodline. So if Bhela had the right to get close with the Young Lady of Blackwood Family, that meant someone coming from the same family should have the same change as her!</p>\n<p>The elder’s niece said, “Young Lady Bhela, I know the main family is prideful. But Young Lady Blackwood is here to experience the village slow life. Don’t you think she also needs to mingle with us commoners?”</p>\n<p>“Lyla will befriend any person she fancies herself, I don’t control with whom she wants to socialize with,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“If that’s the case, then why she still has no friends other than you?”</p>\n<p>“That’s not true!” Lyla cried indignantly, “I’ve made friends! With aunties! Aunties in the kitchen!”</p>\n<p>It was easy to be friendly with Lyla. She was always unconventional and never saw people by the social system. To her, people only divided by two types, those who gave her food and those who didn’t. She was like a cat. Just bring a good food and she’d be very friendly the next moment.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Lyla’s frank open-mindedness wasn’t easily accepted by some people. Elder Jhamil’s niece gasped as she looked at Lyla and Bhela, back and forth. “My goodness! Young Lady Bhela, were you letting a noble young lady such as Young Lady Blackwood mingle with dirty servants?!”</p>\n<p>“Why wouldn’t I?” Bhela asked back.</p>\n<p>“You--don’t young lady care about our family’s reputation? What if people said we’ve mistreated a noble young lady?”</p>\n<p>“Lyla is here to experience village slow life,” Bhela said slowly, “don’t you think she also needs to mingle with commoners?”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s niece was speechless as Bhela used her own words. The contorted expression on her chaky make-up face brought satisfaction for Lyla, who then snorted.</p>\n<p>“What now? Kitty got your tongue?” Lyla said with her mouth pouted. “So that you know, Sis Bhela already made speechless many many bullies like you! Who were many many many times smarter than you! This is what you get by making fun of me--shame on you, hmph! Who’s the stupid one, now?”</p>\n<p>Even after losing a round of squabble against Young Lady Bhela, unexpectedly the nobly young lady herself became hostile against her. All was so sudden that it made blood drained from her face.</p>\n<p>Bhela ruffled Lyla’s hair. Apparently Lyla still believed these girls came to bully her. When Lyla already made up her mind to not liking someone, it was hard to bend on her opinion.</p>\n<p>“Let’s go, Lyla. We’ll help aunties make sweets for afternoon lunch,” Bhela said. Back in the seminars, when Bhela asked Lyla to do some chores, the supposed noble young lady of Blackwood Family would move slowly, occasionally pouting and murmuring some complaints, unwilling to exert her calories on some boring stuff. However, it was different if the destination was kitchen. The spirit of lively bunny would come to possess her--she’d jolt, sprinting, unwilling to waste time as the promise of free sweets and delicious salty snacks was revealed before her.</p>\n<p>“What was that about?!” one of the le bonjour girls scowled after Bhela and Lyla was gone. “How could a young lady speaks like that?”</p>\n<p>“Bhela must lead her around to act like that! Did you hear what she said? The noble young lady thinks we bully her or something.”</p>\n<p>“Aahhh! What a manipulative bitch! I really want to know what that little cunt said to make Young Lady Blackwood think we had made fun of her. No way in hell someone would dare making fun of a noble like her!”</p>\n<p>Actually, Lyla was made fun of so many times. Especially during her study in the seminars abroad. She made fun of so much that she formed a survival instinct to hide behind Bhela’s back. But they didn’t know that. They just assumed as a young lady coming from a noble family, Lyla Blackwood would be adequately pure noble in stories and gossip. The main reason Bhela brought Lyla away was so that Lyla didn’t have to mingle with these delusional le bonjour girls.</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-5/chapter-62":"<p>When the news about what happened in Malikh Family’s ngajen ceremony arrived at Blackwood Family, Madam Blackwood was so enraged she broke the tea cup she held onto the floor. Establishing the family’s foot in Badril Village was supposed to be easy, but not only he failed to gain the support of Malikh Family and the villagers, the Young Master of Blackwood Family somehow managed to incite the bedridden patriarch’s supporters to regain their lost foothold against the corrupt Malikh Family’s elders.</p>\n<p>“There’s no point keeping him in that rural village,” Madam Blackwood said. She was a flamboyant, late thirty years old woman whose beauty was so superior that the previous viscount adopt her as a daughter. “Call Frane back to the city, he’s going to spend two months training in capital!”</p>\n<p>The butler who was waiting for her bowed and went away to carry out the task.</p>\n<p>“How’s Lyla’s birthday party going?”</p>\n<p>“Reply to madam, the party has started, the guests who came only from baron nobilities and mid-rank merchants,” a maid replied.</p>\n<p>The madam glanced the timid middle-aged man who sat on the same table as her. She scoffed, saying, “Look how your daughter made a name for herself. Not only the bribe money was wasted away, she coming on trips in the seminars only resulting her made a fool out of herself! Hah, like father, like daughter! Imbecile!”</p>\n<p>Madam Blackwood hurled the new cup that recently poured with hot, scalding tea. She purposely aimed at the table so the hot water splashed on the viscount’s hands. The timid viscount didn’t make a sound when his hands getting burnt, he didn’t dare to fight against his wife. It was already ten years too late for him to retaliate in any way. From the way he dragged his limping leg to fetch damp towel for his scaling skin, it was clear the waiting servants already used to ignore him.</p>\n<p>Recently, his wife’s mood had became the worst ever since their youngest daughter came back from the two years seminars. Unlike Frane--who only registered as his son by blood in papers, Lyla hadn’t show any particular talents in becoming a Class worthy of a noble family. She had a decent progress speed, a Level 7 Novice after seminars, but that progress mainly because she never had the interest to train herself. Madam Blackwood had bribed the officials so Lyla could enter the seminars supposed to boost her standing in high society, so she could catch higher ranking nobles eyes somehow. However, that plan failed in the worst way that could happen to a noble family like the Blackwood. She made blunders and broke rules so many times that she became a laughing stock. The only families that interested in her only lower rank nobles and not-so well off merchant families.</p>\n<p>“There also no point keeping that useless girl forever in the mansion,” Madam Blackwood said. “Send her to Badril Village by tomorrow. Make some smart men tending to her needs--they have to smart enough to know how to reel those Malikh villagers to say yes when I send my words in the future!”</p>\n<p>After the son’s failure, the madam would send her daughter, to do nothing but play around in Malikh Family. Even if there was something the girl could do, the madam surely wouldn’t choose this daughter of hers who she deemed too brainless to do even the simplest tasks. Her daughter was just that useless to her. The one with received the orders were people who accompanied her, who had experience in bribing and coercing. They were tasked to devour Malikh Family from the inside. The Blackwood would surely corner Bhela Malikh this time.</p>\n<p>Somewhere else, in a colorless courtyard, a birthday party already went on for about two hours. Most guests already leaving, not unlike the year before the two-years seminars happened when the sons of noble families dallying around waiting for a chance to talk with the young lady. Today, the Young Lady of Blackwood Family turned fourteen, two years before she would considered mature, but this young miss still pouting her mouth like a little girl.</p>\n<p>The old handmaid saw her young lady was bored and offered a treat.</p>\n<p>“Young lady, try this cake. A certain famous bakery made this just for your birthday.”</p>\n<p>The cake served on a small plate along with a silver fork. The girl took only mere seconds to finish it.</p>\n<p>“Is it good?” the handmaid asked.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t matter if it’s good or not, Aunt Jiji, I still hungry with this tiny minny bit of cake! Let me eat that one!” the girl pointed at the layered cake served on the center of the party.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Lyla, you can’t!”</p>\n<p>“Why can’t I?!”</p>\n<p>“You must present yourself as a proper young lady, so you can’t!”</p>\n<p>The cake was to be portioned to serve for the same amount of guests since the last party, but because the Blackwood Family’s young lady had a bad reputation in the seminars, most invited families didn’t actually come.</p>\n<p>“But I can’t be a lady if I’m hungry, am I?”</p>\n<p>“You must learn the way. Be patient, Young Lady Lyla!”</p>\n<p>“But I am huuungriiiiieeeehhh!!!”</p>\n<p>Aunt Jiji was terrified when she realized the young lady wasn’t referred only to portion of the cake, but she wanted to eat the whole cake. This shorty girl, although her feature was thin with only her cheeks got plump, actually had a talent to be a terrifying glutton that would be seen in Tiramikal Continent every one hundred years. It was a useless talent that brought only shame to Blackwood Family.</p>\n<p>It was fortunate that before the young lady could make a big ruckus, a maidservant came to bring the news about the madam’s decision. Aunt Jiji passed it to the young lady immediately.</p>\n<p>“You heard that, young lady! Madam is going to send you for a vacation!”</p>\n<p>Lyla’s head straightened, she forgot to pout. “Vacation? Where? Where where?”</p>\n<p>“To Badril Village!”</p>\n<p>“Badril Village?” the girl tilted her head. “Where’s that?”</p>\n<p>“If you promise Aunt Jiji not to eat too much cake today, Aunt Jiji will tell you where it is…”</p>\n<p>“I will if it turned out somewhere fun!”</p>\n<p>“Badril Village is where Young Lady Bhela’s home place!”</p>\n<p>“Sis Bhela’s home?!” Lyla gasped, “yahoooo!!!”</p>\n<p>Ignoring that she was the center of attention, Lyla suddenly jumped and danced like no tomorrow. Aunt Jiji tried to stop her, but it was futile since Lyla only promised not to be glutton. The remaining guests began whispering with each other. They were people who doubted the rumors about this Young Lady Blackwood, but after seeing how childish and ridiculous the girl danced, people were finally convinced. How was this a viscount’s daughter supposed to act? The girl danced her hips and hopped around like a bunny that had an itchy bum. Soon, the Young Lady Lyla Blackwood fell to the bottom list of desired young ladies to marry. Her reputation fell from not-so-smart, to stupid, and then fell again to brainless and imbecile. People didn’t see her in a good light. But that just how a girl named Lyla Blackwood really was.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Yashura Family got a peculiar visitor these past two days. He introduced himself as an expert from overseas, and somehow this foreign expert became interested in Shira Yashura. When the story leaked by insiders from Yashura Family, people were scratching their heads, wondering what could an educated man saw from this trash who could only get himself to level 3 Novice. Some people even sneered, saying that whole news was just Yashura Family’s little trick to clear up rumors from their heir’s name.</p>\n<p>“You understand, kiddo? There are three mandatory rules if someone wants to meet privately with me. First rule, it’s a <em>she</em>, not <em>he</em>. Second rule, big boobs. Third rule, in her lower part, there must be big bubbly butts, as big as her boobs. <em>Anything</em> lesser than that you can just send them back to wherever they came from.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit said that as he moved his chess piece, eating one of Shira’s pawns.</p>\n<p>“And remember, my standard is pretty high. Consult with how loadful those girls from Big-Boobed Sect are for more information,” the Nalaq continued.</p>\n<p>“Please don’t talk nonsense. I’m being serious here,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“Ey, I’m not talking nonsense. The girls from Big-Boobed Sect are real deal, okay? They’re huge! If you don’t believe me then you should go to Elzhier Family one of these days, go check out how glorious their boobs are. They always dance or become the maidservants when they’re not on duties.”</p>\n<p>“Ol’ Good-Natured Spirit… I don’t want to hear this imaginary all-woman sect of yours. Elzhier Family is only a normal rural family, they don’t host any sect members within their walls. If they did, the Village Head would boast about it at my uncle’s face every single day.”</p>\n<p>“You just don’t believe it because you never see how great they are--their boobs, I mean. How great those melons inside tight suits are! Just think about it; leather suits and melons--two entirely different things but if they come together they’d jiggling in harmony. This Good-Natured Spirit approved their sense of style.”</p>\n<p>“Forget about it, it’s not important--”</p>\n<p>“Boobs are important, ey!”</p>\n<p>Shira waved his hand as he didn’t want to continue this nonsense. He then moved a piece and finished his turn. He returned the topic back again, “The expert said he came from a first-tier faction called Blue Robe Society. If we can get his faction’s recognition then at least my family can silence all those rumors about me--especially the recent ones, they really are becoming a pain in the ass.”</p>\n<p>“I told you. I don’t talk with guys. No boobs, no good. Period.”</p>\n<p>“You are really becoming a pain in the ass,” Shira complained.</p>\n<p>After Shira said that, Good-Natured Spirit’s knight jumped over a wall of pawns to get on his bishop. Within a single breath Shira immediately moved his rook, creating a chain reaction that exposes the Nalaq’s defence, resulting his king trapped in three different direction.</p>\n<p>“Check mate.”</p>\n<p>“Ey, what the fu--” Good-Natured Spirit rage quit, flipping the chess board. “Hah! I knew it! You brat, you intentionally make me talk about boobs in order to lower my guard, right?! Fuck! That is how it is, isn’t it?!”</p>\n<p>“No, it is not.”</p>\n<p>“You sneaky bastard. You really got me,” Good-Natured Spirit threw his hands up in the air. <br>\n“Man, I surrender, that is some sick psychological tactic you got there.”</p>\n<p>“Now I don’t really know what you’re talking about.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit waved his hands in surrender, then he lit a cigarette. “Anyway, what do you want from me this time? Money again? I prepared some kobe coins enough for you to buy some candy, here, take this.”</p>\n<p>Shira shoved back the coin bag. “Not today. I just want you to meet Sir Baront Staterwind.”</p>\n<p>“No boobs, no good. Ask something else. How about I tell you the secret place where are those Big-Boobed Sect girls take their bath, ‘ey? Seems fair deal to me.”</p>\n<p>“How many times do I have to tell you--”</p>\n<p>“Sssshhh!!” Good-Natured Spirit hushed the boy. He then whispered, “you hear that?”</p>\n<p>Because the Nalaq suddenly became vigilant, Shira instinctively lowered his voice too. “Hear what?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“I heard some rats watching us…” the Nalaq covered his mouth, as if he didn’t want people to read lips what he said next, “some big-boobed rats…”</p>\n<p>“Huh… what?”</p>\n<p>“The girls from Big-Boobed Sect… they’re here…”</p>\n<p>“The heck are you talking about? This hill is Yashura Family’s property--”</p>\n<p>“Sssshhhh! They’ve noticed me noticing them. Wait here, I’mma get you some melons for your reward!”</p>\n<p>After he saying that, Good-Natured Spirit’s figure melting into the thin air.</p>\n<p>Shira Yashura sighed. At times, asking favor to this vulgar Nalaq not only difficult, it also unpredictable he’d only incite troubles if he not careful.</p>\n<p>After his winning streak for more than half a year maybe he became cocky. He forgot the Nalaq wasn’t there to solve his problem whenever he wanted, although the Nalaq sort of ended up like that after a few months he came here. Shira got some thinking, maybe he should stop seeing this Nalaq as his convenient piggy bank for his own good.</p>\n<p>“Really, he always making a mess for me to clean. I wonder if such thoughtless Nalaqs like him are common around here… now, where’s the last piece again?” he sighed for the second time.</p>\n<p>When he was picking up chess pieces that board Good-Natured Spirit flipped earlier, Shira realized there was a missing piece. Turned out it was stuck in the hole between tree roots.</p>\n<p>He plunged his hand to look for the missing chess piece.</p>\n<p>“Ugh… my fingers can’t reach.”</p>\n<p>He tried to squirm his body to fit his hand in.</p>\n<p>“Where is it again?”</p>\n<p>He frowned. He squirmed his body again really hard.</p>\n<p>“Oh, there it--”</p>\n<p><em>BOOOOOMMMMM!!!!</em></p>\n<p>An explosion happened not far away from the place he used to hang out, creating a wave of rolling dust that swept over the hill. Shira got his hand stuck between the tree rots, he could only hugged his head with his free hand and waited for the shockwave to finish. The chess pieces he gathered already nowhere to be found. He cooked up his head, looking left and right, and saw the greeny grasses were covered with dirts and trees were uprooted. The whole hill became a shithole kind of mess.</p>\n<p>Before the boy could swallow what was going on, a chuckle could be heard near him. Before him, Good-Natured Spirit emerged, coiling around the Nalaq’s body were purple-colored living flames that hungrily tried to eat him whole.</p>\n<p>As carefree as he usually was, Good-Natured Spirit said with a grin, “Those Big-Boobed Sect girls sure are feisty. They’re escaping too fast, I can’t get you melons. I managed to get a feeling of their butts, though. Here, there’s some fragrant left behind.”</p>\n<p>Shira stepped back when the Nalaq offered his palm. It was still on fire, the boy didn’t want to get burn along with him. Besides, he didn’t want to get involved with the Nalaq’s deprived hobby.</p>\n<p>“Sure you don’t want it?” Good-Natured Spirit took a last sniff from his palm, followed by a low chuckle of his.</p>\n<p>“Good-Natured Spirit… what’s that fire?”</p>\n<p>“Yeah? Dunno, man. Exorcism flame or something.”</p>\n<p>“Ohh… oh, it’s very nice to know you up until know. Good bye.”</p>\n<p>“Hmm? You want to go somewhere?” Realizing the purple flame was getting annoying, Good-Natured Spirit then patted away the coiling flame from his shoulders like it was nothing.</p>\n<p>Shira shrugged his shoulders. It seemed this bastard Nalaq was too tough for that exorcism flame. Maybe the flame was too ordinary? Whatever, he didn’t care about that anymore. His eyes then swept the ruin around him. He said, “You can’t forget about the meeting for today. But please clean the mess you made yourself.”</p>\n<p>“That’s what you want for the chess reward?”</p>\n<p>Shira nodded.</p>\n<p>“Aye, aye, will do.” Good-Natured Spirit flicked his fingers, and human-sized paper cranes came out of thin air. They were obedient, not clear whether were monsters or just magical devices. The paper cranes used magnet-like magic to carry the messy uprooted trees and boulders, along with sweeping the dirt from the grass. The cleaning up might take a while, since the hill really was a mess. Shira, feeling a little light on the head, facepalming as he returned back to Yashura Family.</p>\n<p>The whole explosion could be heard from all over Badril Village. It wasn’t clear what its cause, but Yashura Family sent guards to prevent people from knowing what really happened. In Yashura Family’s guest hall, Patriarch Shuro Yashura, a few good Yashura Family elders, and the respected visitor, Sir Baront Staterwind, forming a circle as they sat cross-legged, discussing the explosion that had just occurred.</p>\n<p>“Good elders, Sir Patriarch Yashura, I know you must get excited when I said Young Master Shira has some talent in communicating with Nalaqs. However, a Nalaq still a Nalaq. You must not offend a Nalaq whatsoever, or the consequence is dire! Young Master Shira’s life is way more important than getting a qualification to enter my school!” Sir Baront Staterwind warned. His forehead was still wet with sweat, since he hurriedly ran to Yashura Family when he realized the direction of recent explosion.</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, you’re right, Sir Staterwind. Absolutely right! I already sent someone to check on my nephew’s condition, please calm down,” Patriarch Shuro said.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront shook his head. “You don’t really know what I’m trying to say, do you? You should prepare a very good healer or a doctor, Patriarch Shuro, because if it isn’t death, one can easily lose a limb over angering a Nalaq! That happens more often than you think!”</p>\n<p>The elders drew cold breaths in unison when they heard that. Patriarch Shuro, whose face already pale, becoming even whiter than a sheet of paper. If they boy lost a limb, Shira’s chance to succeed him as the next patriarch could be swept away like specks of dust.</p>\n<p>Yulong the Butler arrived. Everyone in the room had been anxiously waiting for him they instinctively stood up when Yulong approached.</p>\n<p>“Yulong, how’s Shira doing?” Patriarch Shuro asked.</p>\n<p>Yulong replied, “Young Master Shira is back, patriarch. But Madam Yashura sent him to the kitchen for a second breakfast.”</p>\n<p>“Breakfast? What’s a breakfast has something to do with that explosion? Can he still walk?”</p>\n<p>“He’s walking fine, Patriarch Yashura.”</p>\n<p>“Then, Yulong, please go fetch my nephew for me, we have something urgent to tell him!”</p>\n<p>After his trained elegant bow, Yulong stepped back and proceeded to do the task given to him.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront Staterwind peered at the butler’s back. He traveled southern lands many times, visiting many villages, yet, he seldom heard a Mossack descent major family employed western-style butler. What made him confused even more that Sir Kurusiya apparently knew the butler and gave his respect to him, which Sir Baront Staterwind didn’t expect that coming from the cold eastern Kaya swordsman.</p>\n<p>“Dear good elder,” Sir Baront Staterwind asked a random elder who sat beside him, “may I know why there’s a butler working here?”</p>\n<p>“Is Sir referring to Yulong? Yulong isn’t actually working for Yashura Family, but Young Master Shira’s mother’s attendant. I can’t tell you the details, so forgive me sir, all I can say is Young Master Shira’s father is exceedingly brave and awesome he managed to woo a respectable lady many years ago.”</p>\n<p>“Ahhh…” Sir Baront nodded. The boy apparently a result of his parent eloping. The Blue Robe Society expert of course knew etiquette to hold himself from digging the story further.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, Yulong came back with Shira followed behind. The boy wore new clothes since his previous one was dirty. When he saw the group of elders and the expert guest looking at him, Shira sighed inside his heart. He knew he had to clean Good-Natured Spirit’s mess once again.</p>\n<p>“Greetings, elders… greetings, uncle patriarch… greetings, Sir Staterwind…”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro impatiently treading forward. “Shira my boy, is it true that you lost your limbs?”</p>\n<p>“I’m unhurt, uncle, see?” Shira waved both of his hands to prove that his limbs still functioned as they should be.</p>\n<p>“Oh! God, thank God! Really! These are really your hands, aren’t they? Not a fake one made with wood?” Patriarch Shuro Yashura grabbed his nephew hands and waved it around like a child playing with flags.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira,” Sir Baront opened his mouth, “I reckon you failed to ask the Nalaq to meet me? If you can’t do it, young master, it best for you not to push him any further. Today, you offend him and he blast the hill behind your Yashura Family as a warning, but what happens if you make the same mistake tomorrow?”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro nodded at his words vigorously. “Sir Baront is right, Shira my boy. A Nalaq is a revered being ancient Mossacks worshiped as their guardian angel. The consequence of making them mad is very dire! You should know better, my boy, you should’ve told your uncle if a Nalaq came to you the first time!”</p>\n<p>Sir Baront and his uncle Patriarch Shuro had good intentions in telling him about how to be respectful to a Nalaq. But the more Shira heard their warning, the more he doubted about Good-Natured Spirit being a “revered” Nalaq like they said. Of course, saying the truth about the explosion’s true cause resulting only Yashura Family losing face in front of Sir Baront Staterwind. Shira had no choice, he had to tread the matter very carefully.</p>\n<p>“<em>Cough, cough</em>… Uncle, Sir Baront, thank you for your concern. Truth is, it wasn’t that the Nalaq being mad that causes the explosion, but there was some… accident… that happened right before.”</p>\n<p>“With what title do you usually call him, Young Master Shira?” Sir Baront asked.</p>\n<p>“As far as I know, he doesn’t have a title. At least he didn’t tell me if he ever had one. He told me to call him ‘Good-Natured Spirit’.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, with that kind of nickname, he must be a very benevolent person when he was alive,” Sir Baront concluded as he rubbed his beard. “So, Young Master Shira, it seems he didn’t really intent to blast into smithereens.”</p>\n<p>Shira nodded. That part was true. Instead, someone else happened to be intending to blast this Nalaq into smithereens.</p>\n<p>“Thank God! Thank God! If he is a good Nalaq, maybe we don’t need to throw the second ngajen ceremony for this month, after all!” Patriarch Shuro Yashura exclaimed. The elders in the guest hall followed his exclaiming by handclapping and joyful cries. Ngajen ceremony only held once a month so the village safe from angry Selaqs, no one ever tried it to protect themselves from intelligent Nalaqs. Since the village was founded, the locals never had a Nalaq dwelling there. So it was natural for the elders to worry about throwing a ceremony they didn’t know working or not. Ngajen ceremony was expensive, after all.</p>\n<p>The more Shira saw how the previous tense hall turned jubilant and full of relieved faces, the more awkward he became. That Nalaq might call himself ‘Good-Natured Spirit’, yet he was anything but good. A low-life spirit who no doubt had been using the invisibility traits of spirits to commit many deprived crimes. He was closer to evil spirit incarnation than a good-natured one. The misunderstanding was too great his face twisted as if he’d just taste a sour lemon.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront Staterwind said, “Still, since he seems reluctant to use his old name, I reckon the Nalaq that approaching you is a low-tier one, Young Master Shira. Low-tier Nalaqs usually spirits that gain consciousness merely by luck. They don’t have factions backing them, and fortunately--in my experience--it easier to initiate negotiation with unaffiliated Nalaqs.” A hint of pride then flashed through his eyes, he continued, “my disciples will arrive tomorrow morning. One of them contracted with a high-tier Nalaq. Since the Nalaq’s mood turned sour is partly my fault, with help from the Nalaq contracted with one of my disciples, I will ask him to leave Yashura Family peacefully!”</p>\n<p>“Sir Staterwind is wise! Thank you for your concern, Sir!” Patriarch Shuro sang praises toward this expert. The elders of Yashura Family followed suit.</p>\n<p>“As expected of such expert!”</p>\n<p>“Sir Staterwind is the best of bunch of all experts that I know all my life!”</p>\n<p>“Hurray for Sir Staterwind!”</p>\n<p>They circling Sir Baront Staterwind and, not long after that, someone started to prostate. They behaved as if the guest was their one and only savior. Even Shira was getting embarrassed from seeing the scene, not to mention the already flushing Baront Staterwind.</p>\n<p>When everyone getting carried away, Shira slipped out after excusing himself. He knew he was no match for the Yashura Family’s older generations’ shamelessness. Upon walking outside, he saw Yulong was standing by the hall’s door looking galant as usual with his butler professionalism.</p>\n<p>“Can you please try to stop my uncle, Yulong? Sir Staterwind is started to get uncomfortable there.”</p>\n<p>Yulong glanced at the whole mess inside, and then he said to his young master, “I think it’s not everyday an expert coming to Yashura Family, young master, so let’s count this as Patriarch Yashura to gaining favors from a foreign expert.”</p>\n<p>“Are they really okay, though?”</p>\n<p>Yulong smiled.</p>\n<p>“Of course they aren’t, young master. But Patriarch Shuro and the family elders are honest people. Although sometimes they can be overwhelming, I’m sure Sir Staterwind can see no falsehood in their words.”</p>\n<p>Shira looked at those elders inside once again. The more he saw, the more he realized that those hysterical village men calling a man they barely knew these past two days a savior by no means a lie from their part. The elders really were freaking out when they heard the explosion. And Patriarch Shuro Yashura was the most worried of the bunch, considering him a patriarch and an uncle. Thinking about it all again, Shira couldn’t really say he still embarrassed seeing the elders spewing exaggerated flattering with straight faces.</p>\n<p>“Sir Staterwind comes from a respectable sect. Someone like that won’t get to travel the southern lands if he didn’t know the nature of the local people. So it best not to worry about it too much, young master,” Yulong said.</p>\n<p>“Really… ah, speaking of sects,” Shira deliberately changed the topic, “I heard from someone that one of the major families in Badril Village hosts members of a certain sect in secret. You’re from outside, Yulong--do you think something so outrageous like that could happen?”</p>\n<p>“Some older sects have long reaching influence, but I don’t think anyone would be interested to plant their own in Badril Village. There’s nothing valuable here for them to take notice.”</p>\n<p>“As I thought. It’s just unthinkable to think some secret powers lurking beneath our everyday lives. What if some experts actually pretending to be servants here in Yashura Family?”</p>\n<p>Although it wasn’t noticeable, Yulong’s smile became stiff.</p>\n<p>“You jest, young master. If that was true, do you think your uncle and the elders can take that kind of truth?”</p>\n<p>Following Yulong’s gaze, Shira peeped the hall and saw Sir Baront’s awkward figure, where he was in the center of Yashura Family elites--all of them-- who passionately prostrating in the floor. They practically worshipping him now.</p>\n<p>“You’re right…” Shira could only hide his face with his palm. Just when he thought he could understand them, the boy then wished he didn’t know these shameless men.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>As far as the current generation of Badril Village locals knew, they never got visited by nobles until this month Malikh Family’s ngajen ceremony happened. Everyone still talking about it.</p>\n<p>Young Master of Blackwood Family only stayed in Badril Village in one day. And the noble carriage of Blackwood Family set off out of Badril Village by noon. The next morning after the day he was gone, the two foreign guests who had been staying in Malikh Family, Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia, felt overstaying might be unnecessary, thus decided to leave too.</p>\n<p>Because the carriages going out from Badril Village mostly for public transports, Bhela personally asked an elder from his father’s faction who had a horse carriage to give her guests a ride to the nearest town, where they’d later book a private carriage for them to return home. Mister Harrington, as an unsocial bachelor as he always was, was waiting in the carriage for Madame Sylvia to say her parting words to Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>“You have a very bright future, Young Lady Bhela. A girl with limitless potential. So your favor will become very valuable as you mature,” Madame Sylvia said. “If you need something, you can always send letters to my sect. Don’t hold back. Just think about this of us making an investment.”</p>\n<p>Since Bhela a smart girl anyway, Madame Sylvia decided not to make her words fancy and told her in a straightforward manner. Bhela appreciated her honesty, and said her thanks.</p>\n<p>The carriage then set off. In the main gate of Badril Village, the guards on duty witnessed the recently blazing popular Young Lady Bhela Malikh bowing her body as she sent off two foreigners in traveling clothes made from expensive linen.</p>\n<p>“Look at how she is,” inside the carriage, Madame Sylvia said to Mister Harrington. “She’s a pretty sensible girl, don’t you think?”</p>\n<p>“She is,” Mister Harrington said softly, almost a murmur.</p>\n<p>It was hard to start a conversation whenever Mister Harrington sat with his arms crossed tightly. Madame Sylvia could see that he wasn’t exactly happy with the outcome regarding Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>There was no bandits lurking around, and no monsters occasionally came out, proved that the lands around Badril Village actually well-protected--too well, perhaps, for a rural village without a major power backing them. Their journey was smooth without disturbance. Thirty minutes after they left Badril Village, they encountered another carriage painted with black-jet color. The black carriage was well-decorated with golden-colored plates, obviously elites or nobles were traveling inside.</p>\n<p>However, unlike common nobles who liked to hide in the carriage to show-off their elegance and aloofness, this carriage simply out of commonsense. To talk about how weird this carriage was there was a need to point out the refreshing greenness of the view around. Despite there being a road far away from settlement, hint of liveliness from bird chirping--along with croaking frogs from nearby streams and singing insects--completed the idyllic road with a strange harmony that invited light-hearted person to sing along with lively nature. That was exactly what the noble in the black carriage doing. A young lady with a very girly and childish feature was carefreely sitting in the window in spite of pale servants begging her to sit still. She completely dumb about the servants’ pleas. And with her personality, nobody knew whether she was pretending or not. The only thing that the jubilant Lyla Blackwood cared about was singing an off-tune song about her befriending village frogs and bunnies.</p>\n<p>“Prepare your life you frogs and bunnies~</p>\n<p>Cause I’m not letting you go before we become the best of buddies~~</p>\n<p>Wait for me you birdies and kitties~~</p>\n<p>Cause we’re about to become the best of all buddies~~ yuhuu~ yuhuu~~</p>\n<p>The best buddies in this lifetime~~ yuhuuuu~~~”</p>\n<p>There was nothing the servants and the guards could do to stop their young lady from singing this amazingly ugly song about her future exploits in Badril Village. Seeing that another carriage approaching, the horse-riding guards did their best to block the view to the crest planted on the carriage’s compartment. Their effort to save faces from the young lady’s mishap was futile, however, since the other party happened to know Lyla.</p>\n<p>“How many times have I told you to stay away from windows, Lyla!”</p>\n<p>“Whu--what? Who?” Lyla was surprised. But then she was elated to see a familiar face. “Is that you, Instructor Sylvia? You here to train Sis Bhela’s archery again?”</p>\n<p>“Get down from the window!” Madame Sylvia raised her voice.</p>\n<p>“I’m also here to meet Sis Bhela!” Lyla also raised her voice cheerfully.</p>\n<p>“Lyla, you won’t be able to get married in the future if you’re always act like this!” Madame Sylvia warned her. She long dropped title of Young Lady Blackwood when talking to this naughty girl.</p>\n<p>“Um!” Lyla nodded. “But which one do you like more, Instructor Sylvia, bunnies or kitties?” It was no use trying to talk sense to Lyla. Any warning only come to her right ear and gone out straight from the left one.</p>\n<p>“Stay away from the windows!!!” Madame Sylvia screamed until her voice shrilled.</p>\n<p>Lyla also screamed, “Good morning to you too!!!”</p>\n<p>Both carriages drifted apart after the brief encounter. It ended with Lyla happily waved her hands happily. Madame Sylvia sighed and shook her head. That girl was so naughty that the troubles she created made the seminars’ managements even considered to drop her once during the seminars. Only after Bhela Malikh convinced them she’d take care of Lyla they finally did let go the matter.</p>\n<p>Before, the black carriage of Blackwood Family came to Badril Village in the shroud of night’s darkness, so nobody noticed their elegance and the aura of expensive carriage blazing through the village road--of which was surprisingly wide for a settlement road, unlike road of cities in the western kingdoms, because long ago Mossack people needed to endure monster stampedes passing through their villages once every few months.</p>\n<p>“Mom, look, is that a noble?” a snotty kid pointing out the carriage.</p>\n<p>The mother hurriedly pulled her child. “Ssuuussh! Keep your finger to yourself! Don’t you know what happened to peasants that make noble angry from the stories they always talking about?”</p>\n<p>The steel-armored guards who escort the carriage scoffed them in disdain. Contrast with the escorts’ attitudes, Lyla waved her hand at them, while shouting, “Hey boy, don’t you think bunnies are cute as the kitties? Or do you like cats more?”</p>\n<p>The kid didn’t answer. He instead forced to bow by her mother and let the carriage went through silently. The villagers didn’t have the experience in receiving nobles, most of them--except for those who attended the ngajen ceremony in Malikh Family--had never saw nobles in their lives. Because of that they were awkward and didn’t know what to do.</p>\n<p>Lyla didn’t seem to mind their stiffness. Instead, she vigorously greeted everyone she saw from the window she sat on.</p>\n<p>“Good day! Good morning! I’m here to sleepover at Sis Bhela’s place! Do you know where Sis Bhela lives?”</p>\n<p>Back in Elzhier Family, in the main family’s house, their patriarch, hurriedly changed his clothes to a formal one he always used every ngajen ceremony.</p>\n<p>“Hurry, hurry! As the head of this village, how can I let a noble arriving without me receiving them?!”</p>\n<p>Not even he yet buttoned his shirt properly, the Village Head sprinted toward the main street, only to see the crowd of onlookers already dispersed and still talking about the scary nobles they always heard in stories were actually <em>weirdly</em> friendly.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Bhela Malikh was already notified about Lyla Blackwood’s arrival. She waited on a chair at the Malikh Family’s gate, drinking a fresh young coconut water occasionally. The black carriage finally was in her view. And the young girl she was waiting for happily waved her hand at her. From the window.</p>\n<p>“Carefull, Lyla!” Bhela yelled as she sprang from her chair.</p>\n<p>“Huuupp!” Lyla Blackwood simply didn’t want to waste anytime leaving the carriage through the door. So she simply jumped from the window she sat upon, before the carriage even stopped. It was fortunate that amongst Bhela’s skill as a Unique Class, she had <b>Haste</b>, which boosted her speed in short duration. She used that to catch Lyla before she hurt herself. The young noble girl landed splendidly in Bhela’s arm.</p>\n<p>“What’s this, Sistah?” Lyla’s eyes sparkled when she saw Bhela get a young coconut in her other hand. She was completely oblivious she just did something dangerous.</p>\n<p>“Young coconut. There’s still some of its water left. Here, try this,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“For me? Really?”</p>\n<p>“Drink slowly…”</p>\n<p><em>Glug glug glug</em>. Lyla drank the coconut in anything but in slowly manner. She even burped shamelessly.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Lyla, ah!” the butler who coming with her was in horror seeing how Young Lady Lyla Blackwood made a horrible mess by spilling the coconut water on her expensive, silk woven black dress. Only an equally expensive silk handkerchief worthy enough to wipe his young lady’s noble dress!</p>\n<p>“I told you to drink slowly…” Bhela said. She used her sleeve to wipe Lyla’s wet face, and then proceeded to also wipe Lyla’s dress.</p>\n<p>“Y-young miss!” the butler shouted in panic. His body jolted as soon as he saw the outrageous act of spoiling the young noble’s dress by making it contacted with commoner clothes. That was heresy! He needed her to stop before she contained Blackwood’s expensive dress with her commoner’s bacteria!</p>\n<p>“You need something?” Bhela looked at this unfamiliar butler of Blackwood Family. Her expressionless face judged the butler coldly.</p>\n<p>“My name is Tim, young miss--please use this!” the butler offered a silky smooth handkerchief with Blackwood Family’s crest embroidered on the surface. The handkerchief was actually the butler’s, was awarded to his great-great-great grandfather by the then Baron Blackwood for some sort of achievement that practically nobody was still alive to remember. Everytime Butler Tim met a new person, he’d make an excuse to show off this particular handkerchief. Today was no exception. It was his most precious handkerchief. Just from the look of it one could tell how crazy expensive it was.</p>\n<p>“Ah, ah… my nose… aahhh--” Lyla felt her nose was wet and itchy, “--ahhtchii!!!”</p>\n<p>“You’ve got a flu?” Bhela asked worriedly.</p>\n<p>“Yeah. Aunt Jiji told me to drink my medicine everyday but it’s so bitter. So much bitter that it’s evil!”</p>\n<p>“Where’s your medicine now?”</p>\n<p>“Oh. I throw it away last night.”</p>\n<p>Bhela shook her head.</p>\n<p>“That’s no good. You can’t throw away your medicine like that. Now, wipe your nose. This mister butler said to use this…” she put the handkerchief on Lyla’s nose, and Lyla blew her nose on it.</p>\n<p>Lyla gave back the handkerchief to Butler Tim. “Thank you, Sir Butler. It’s very helpful of you.”</p>\n<p>The butler received back his most precious handkerchief. Bonus Lyla’s snot.</p>\n<p>“Come on inside,” Bhela said to Lyla. “Even if the water runs dry, coconuts still have meat we can scoop. After that we’ll pick some star fruits that I planted since I was a child.”</p>\n<p>“Star fruits! Woohooo!”</p>\n<p>The girls then walked inside. Lyla was so excited she didn’t leave her friend, hanging on her neck like a koala being comfortable on a tree branch. The stories about a noble young lady coming to Malikh Family for Bhela Malikh spread amongst the maidservants like oil being poured on an open wildfire. The Malikhs couldn’t describe the pride seeing their eldest young lady with a blue blood friend. Especially the aunties. They watched how close Bhela and Lyla with teary eyes and happy smiles.</p>\n<p>“Young lady is… finally… finally…”</p>\n<p>“She finally has a friend…”</p>\n<p>“Huuu… huuu… merciful Goddesses finally saw the young lady’s plight and blessed her with a real friend… huuu huuuu….”</p>\n<p>Nobody more happier than the aunties who were familiar with how their Young Lady Bhela lived her live. They silently cried watching their young lady, who usually alone and unapproachable, finally grown up and had her first friend in these past ten years.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Butler Tim grimaced inside. Despite the fact that he was tasked to win over Bhela Malikh with any means necessary, he didn’t like this girl. It wasn’t because his handkerchief got dirty--well, maybe he resented her for it a little--it because the girl named Bhela Malikh wasn’t acting as a young country girl supposed to act. Country bumpkins supposed to falter when they saw the radiance seeped out of the nobles’ aura, they supposed to tremble when they saw the noble wealth glittering beneath the sun. But this girl was indifferent and aloof. She was cold but the coldness paired with concise and elegant mannerism. Butler Tim knew she trying to act noble herself. That was why he didn’t like her.</p>\n<p>However, Butler Tim was a smart person. Any smart person would wear a perfect smile despite his heart bleeding over the snot on his precious handkerchief. Before leaving the city, the butler didn’t forget to look for a gift he’d use to lower the Malikh Family’s guard. He heard the previous gift was rejected, and when he asked for the content of the gift, the smart Butler Tim shook his head as if he knew it would happen.</p>\n<p>Toward country bumpkins, too expensive gifts would never work. He knew this because he was smart. And because he was smart, he knew better gifts. Not-so-expensive gifts worked for country bumpkins.</p>\n<p>Therefore, he presented Bhela Malikh with popular city biscuits.</p>\n<p>“I heard this biscuit is currently very popular among noble young ladies. This butler happened to pass by a store that sold this, so I reckon Young Lady Bhela might love to taste some.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, because the elders roughly knew the Blackwood Family’s youngest lady would come to visit, two leaders of opposing factions came to watch how their Young Lady Bhela would receive the noble guest. Elder Jhamil was all smiling because he liked what he saw. But the expression of Elder Khasim turned sour when he saw how the butler of Blackwood Family tried to butter up to Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>“Don’t accept it, young lady, please….” Elder Khasim whispered under his breath. Of course, there was no single soul heard what he just said. He was worried the hard work to rebuild his faction’s morale all would turn into dust if people thought their spiritual mascot, the one and only Young Lady Bhela Malikh, could be bought with mere biscuits.</p>\n<p>Contrary to what Elder Khasim hoped, Bhela Malikh received the gift without even putting a second thought. A feeling of defeat surged inside him. Elder Jhamil looked at his rival with a mocking glance.</p>\n<p>After receiving the snacks, Bhela excused herself and brought Lyla with her to stroll around Malikh Family’s gardens. Butler Tim pretended to wave his hand and smiled, but inside, he was gloating at how hypocrite Bhela was. His guess that Young Lady Bhela wouldn’t refuse the gift he brought was entirely correct. Before, he deliberately said the biscuit was noble young ladies’ favorite. Thus, according to his smart logic, as long as it wasn’t too expensive that it’d scare this fake young lady, no way a noble wannabe would reject this kind of gifts.</p>\n<p>“Heh,” Butler Tim scoffed when Bhela and Lyla already left. “Bet you’ve never eaten any city biscuits your entire life, haven’t you.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, Bhela Malikh hadn’t had any city biscuits her entire life. Not before and also not today. What Butler Tim didn’t know was that the snacks he bought with his own money ultimately ended up returned to Blackwood Family--to be exact, it ended up inside Lyla Blackwood’s belly. Bhela couldn’t help but received the biscuits when, beside her, she saw Lyla was drooling looking at the biscuits.</p>\n<p>The elders led by Elder Jhamil then respectfully welcomed the butler along with servants and guards from Blackwood Family. From the impression alone, Butler Tim could see reasons for him to like this slick-tongued Elder Jhamil. He knew how to flatter and also he knew how to act humble in front of people with higher status than him. Not like that noble-wannabe Young Lady of Malikh Family. This Elder Jhamil knew that he was only a country bumpkin thus acted accordingly. Naturally, the smart Butler Tim was pleased.</p>\n<p>And so began Butler Tim’s quests to swallow Malikh Family with his smartly planned schemes and cunning political games.</p>\n<p>In mere hours, the neutral elders who hadn’t joined either both rivalling factions began flocking to Elder Jhamil’s side. One part because they wanted to side with the faction that had the noble support and another part simply because Elder Jhamil, with the help of Butler Tim, had been throwing around sweet deals over all directions.</p>\n<p>“Only one tenth of the elder council members don’t want to pick a side by now, but their number is too significant to be an obstacle for Sir Butler’s great plan,” Elder Jhamil reported the current situation to Butler Tim.</p>\n<p>The butler was enjoying a glass of tea served by the maid that supposed to serve Young Lady Lyla Blackwood as if he was the visiting noble himself. He nodded. “I see. With this, the first stage of my plan has been completed.”</p>\n<p>“Oohhh!” Elder Jhamil exclaimed. “Sir Butler summoned rain and fire by flipping Malikh Family’s political scene upside down, and this is only the first stage?! As expected, the Butler of Blackwood Family is very smart!”</p>\n<p>Butler Tim originally wanted to act aloof and sophisticated before he visited this rural village. However, upon being called a smart person, he couldn’t help but grinned widely. “Oho, you’re an interesting fella, aren’t you? Very well, since you’ve done a good job yourself, I won’t be so petty to grab all the credit. Tell me how I should do next, if I like what I hear, we might as well corporate your thoughts into my plan.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was excited. How could he not? An opportunity to rise beyond a mere elder of rural village was laid before him.</p>\n<p>“Sir Butler, you may not know this, but we Mossack people regard having a good meal very highly. Everytime we’re having breakfast or dinner together as the entire family, even though we’re always looked peaceful outside, those trivial events actually are a political battlefield for us elders to extend our influence! This lowly man himself used a few move in the past during breakfast to gather like-minded men under my banner. I used all my resources and connections in a single mealtime to attack my rivals! However, these past two days, my biggest rival used a lowly method against me…”</p>\n<p>“Oh? What did he do?” Butler Tim asked.</p>\n<p>“He didn’t do much,” Elder Jhamil said, sneering when he was talking about this rival of his, “all he did was inviting Young Lady Bhela everytime we were having a meal in the family hall. He’s been a stubborn and ignorant supporter of main family, but this time he actually knew how to use his connection with the main family to deal a blow against me. A few of the elders had been faltering when they saw Young Lady Bhela leaning over the other side; I’m afraid if we’re leaving this ignorant rival of me doing as he wanted, there’s gonna be a hole in Sir Butler’s smart plan!”</p>\n<p>Butler Tim swirled the tea in his cup as though he was deep in thought. Of course, if this proven to endanger his smart plan, the butler couldn’t sit still watching all that happened. “I heard the Mossacks are peculiar people, but I don’t know you Mossack people have a strange custom!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, we’re living here far away from the city, so of course our traditions might seem unsophisticated to wise westerners like Sir Butler,” Elder Jhamil fawned.</p>\n<p>“Then what do you suggest Blackwood Family should do in this situation, Elder Jhamil?”</p>\n<p>“It’s easy!” Elder Jhamil was so excited he almost jumped from his seat. “My rival faction used Young Lady Bhela to gain foothold, and we can also use that to deal a greater blow back to them!”</p>\n<p>“And that is?”</p>\n<p>“Of course, we can use--I mean, we can invite young noble miss to a dinner together with us. With this we can unofficially announce our alliance with Blackwood Family! It’s the final nail to main family’s faction!”</p>\n<p>Even though Bhela Malikh’s status as a Unique Class shone throughout all of Badril Village, her name still fall short with a pure noble like Lyla Blackwood. Madam back in Blackwood Family used her daughter so Blackwood could infiltrate Malikh Family easily, but that didn’t mean Lyla still wasn’t as useful.</p>\n<p>“Very well. Let us go with that,” then he asked the maid responsible for Lyla’s schedule. “What was Young Lady Lyla doing this afternoon?”</p>\n<p>The maid replied, “Young Lady Bhela Malikh carried her around to play. At first, they went to Malikh Family’s orchard to pick some fruits. Then they visited the sick Patriarch Malikh in his room for a few minutes. After that, they went outside to stroll and came back with a new rabbit pet they bought from other family. Finally, when the sun is setting, they went to the kitchen to watch the servants cooking.”</p>\n<p>“How uncouth for a noble young lady being led around in dirty places like that,” Butler Tim was displeased, but nothing he could do since making Bhela’s attention elsewhere meant he could move freely to make a trap for her. Nodding to himself, the butler then gave an instruction to the maid, “you go to Young Lady Lyla and tell that Malikh Family invite her for a dinner.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was excitedly rubbing his hands when Butler Tim said that. Finally, payback to those imbecile Elder Khasim!</p>\n<p>“But, Butler Tim…” the maid hesitated.</p>\n<p>“What is it?”</p>\n<p>“Malikh Family already invited Young Lady Lyla to have dinner. She’s eating in Malikh Family’s hall right now….”</p>\n<p>“Hmm, what do you mean?”</p>\n<p>What the maid meant was that someone in Malikh Family already brought Lyla to have dinner with them.</p>\n<p>When Butler Tim playing political games and scheming around in Malikh Family, Bhela Malikh, along with the elders friendly with Elder Khasim, had been giving bunch of candies and food for Lyla Blackwood, much more than the biscuits Butler Tim brought with him. Being a great foodie herself, Lyla never had enough, the first day in Malikh Family she ate more sweets and foods worth of one week back in Blackwood Family’s manor. Aunt Jiji and other Blackwood Family’s maid servants would freak out if they saw how glutton Lyla currently was.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the news that the main family’s faction hosting a dinner for a noble miss swept Malikh Family like a thunderstorm. The neutral elders Elder Jhamil had just bought flocking back toward Elder Khasim’s side. It was so sudden. Everyone wasn’t even got a breath to process what had happened. And this for sure was an unprecedented move ever since Patriarch Ghalim suddenly fell ill and retreated from the political scene.</p>\n<p>Just as one side was busy completing the first stage to win over the Young Lady of Malikh Family, the other side already won over Young Lady of the noble Blackwood Family. All happened in a span of a single day.</p>\n<p>“Y-young Lady Lyla…”</p>\n<p>Even Butler Tim couldn’t pull his own young miss seeing how happy she was. His plan had been jabbed in a completely unexpected way. Maybe he wasn’t so smart after all.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>It was unfortunate that Madam Malikh didn’t see the Young Noble Miss of Blackwood Family kindly. Even though the girl did nothing wrong, Madam Malikh wasn’t so muddled that she wasn’t aware what Blackwood Family and those corrupt elders conspiring against her husband and Malikh’s main family. Even Bhela herself couldn’t do anything to change her mother’s mind.</p>\n<p>However, Lyla Blackwood, an airhead as she always was, was oblivious of the hostility directed toward her.</p>\n<p>It was morning the second day Lyla in Badril Village. Following her friend Bhela, she carried a little box inside Patriarch Ghalim’s bedroom. This little box filled with custom-made medicines--most were amateurly mixed from two different trivial medicines, consisted of remedies for flu and headache. Nothing harmful but nothing useful at the same time. And just like yesterday, to pay for Bhela parents’ kindness for letting her staying in Malikh Family, Lyla Blackwood decided to play doctor a little bit.</p>\n<p>“Uncle, I’m coming again to help you feel better,” Lyla said as she dragged a chair and sat beside Patriarch Ghalim’s sick bed. Seeing the pale middle-aged man in bed, she blinked her googly eyes, then continued, “how’s yesterday medicine I gave you. Are you feeling a tiny minny bit better, perhaps?”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim certainly was feeling better these past few days, not because Lyla’s medicines, but Grandpa Piss’s diagnosis and remedies. Toward this girl, he weakly nodded. “Thank you for your help, little lady.”</p>\n<p>“Then I’m going to fed you my newest recipe, uncle. Here, here, open your mouth.”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghamil did what he was told. Because Lyla didn’t like bitter medicine, she added lots of brown sugar. Lots and lots of brown sugar.</p>\n<p>“It’s… sweet.”</p>\n<p>“Are you feeling better, now?” Lyla asked.</p>\n<p>“Yes, little lady, I’m feeling better.”</p>\n<p>As a matter of fact, he wasn’t. The medicine was more like a candy than remedy.</p>\n<p>“Good! If you eat this three times a day, maybe your illness would go away, uncle,” Lyla then sternly pointed out, “maybe!”</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh was nervous when her husband consumed the strange medicine Lyla gave him, but she didn’t open her mouth to protest. Bhela was changing the pillows’ sheet nearby, and doing some other chores that usually were done by the servants. In the meantime, Lyla was giving advice for Patriarch Ghalim liked how he should eat moderately three times a day, how he should brush his teeth after he ate sweets, and all the things Aunt Jiji told Lyla all the time.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to visit again, uncle, get well soon!” Lyla waved her hands. Carrying a broom in her hands, Lyla’s next schedule was following Bhela doing chores in the courtyard.</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim weakly waved his hand back. Of course, after the girls were already gone, he noticed his bitter wife biting her lips indignantly.</p>\n<p>“Don’t stare the girl so much. She’s not responsible for her family’s wrongdoings. It’s not like a girl her age knows what her parents do behind the scene.”</p>\n<p>“Why did you eat that? What if they used her to give you more poison?”</p>\n<p>“Bhela wouldn’t let me have the medicine if she didn’t what it was, no? Stop putting that kind of face, you only make our daughter feels awkward about all this.”</p>\n<p>The woman held her husband’s hand, kissing it with her forehead as she hid her face. She whispered, “Oh, don’t you know how hurt this heart holding back my grievance? Why did our daughter had to bring someone from that family inside our roof?” she sniffed, “how long this farce gonna last? What should I do in the mean time? Oh! I don’t know! I don’t know!”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim sighed as he witnessed his wife cried helplessly.</p>\n<p>In the courtyard, near the coops where Malikh Family raised chickens and ducks, Lyla was squatting in front of the new bunny she and Bhela bought just yesterday. She was waiting the whole morning just to feed this bunny. The bunny hopped around, itching to play in spite it couldn’t resist the temptation of delicious green leaves, again and again. Wathing how glutton the bunny was, Lyla found herself immerse in immense joy. She very much envying the life of a bunny. Perhaps that because she could relate to how it spent its day without worry; eating, playing, sleeping, then playing again--a life that she longed to have. If only she was born a rabbit instead of a young lady of noble family….</p>\n<p>The sound of the broom swept the ground took away her attention. Lyla couldn’t understand how a daughter of a patriarch like Bhela had to work so much.</p>\n<p>“Why do you work so much, Sistah?” Lyla asked when she found out there still much dry leaves Bhela had to sweep. “Won’t you get bored soon? Just let the servants clean this place.”</p>\n<p>Bhela, sweeping as if Lyla’s idleness didn’t bother her the slightest, replied, “Here in Badril Village, everyone who hasn’t done their coming of age ceremony has to do chores for their parents. It doesn’t matter if it’s the farmer’s daughter or the biggest family’s young lady, helping the matter of the household is one of the seven virtues we Mossack people get to do for our parents.”</p>\n<p>Originally, Lyla wanted her friend also playing with the bunny. But hearing Bhela just said something serious, there was no way she’d reveal her intention now. “My mom always nagging me to go to dance lesson or whatever. It’s very very boring,” she murmured, a bit dejected.</p>\n<p>“The west and the south have different values,” Bhela said. “Complete your virtue for your parents then you’ll grow to be a fine lady, Lyla.”</p>\n<p>“Uggghhh…” Lyla grunted as she didn’t want to continue the topic any further. She long developed a sense for her own survival to detect whether or not the conversation ended up she being forced to do some boring stuff. Knowing Bhela’s personality, Lyla knew soon Sis Bhela’d make her doing chores too. Grabbing the bunny, Lyla quickly escaped somewhere else so that she could spend her time playing. Bhela shook her head seeing the girl’s behavior.</p>\n<p>Bhela then noticed some servants whispering while they looking at Lyla from the distance. Many people were curious what a noble young lady like her would do in a rural place like this, and Bhela wasn’t that oblivious not to notice the eyes planted by the elders of Malikh Family.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, she then saw four girls dressed in expensive garments approaching Lyla with their mouth covered with feathered fans in their hands. Their clothing looked as if they attending some sort of ceremony, while in fact, they calculated that this kind of appearance was the most suitable for them to socialize with a girl of blue-blooded origin. Bhela recognized the leader of those girls was actually Elder Jhamil’s niece.</p>\n<p>“Have you read Le Armour dan Varoza written by Leornador De Gonzalez, Young Lady Blackwood?”</p>\n<p>“Ah, yes, that piece was adequately sophisticated but I think Vista van Gracious’s omnibus more than adequate, le banjour?”</p>\n<p>“I see, I see, their pieces adequately well-written as those senor themselves adequattely live as maestro. But perhaps equoliette more than fit the diagram as paradigm sensorita abligioate senor des adequately le banjour.”</p>\n<p>“But of course, Young Lady Blackwood is more addequately sophisitacted as it’s a noblesse obligiote to be more sohpisitacated than us village senioritas. Perhaps le banjour is fortuna with de gracious by Young Lady’s great wisdom?”</p>\n<p>Lyla blinked her eyes trying to decipher whatever these girls mean. The bunny in her arms even escaped amidst her confusion.</p>\n<p>“Uhh… uhhh…” Lyla timidly stepped back from the feathered fan girls. “I think Sis Bhela is calling me…”</p>\n<p>She swiftly ran away back to her friend Bhela.</p>\n<p>“Sistah, Sistah Bhela!” Lyla cried and grabbing Bhela’s sloven sleeve tightly, demanding for justice, “they came to bully me!”</p>\n<p>“What did they do?” Bhela asked.</p>\n<p>“They know I can’t speak western language! They came to test me! They’re even worse than those rich girls in seminar--they jumble some western mumbo jumbo into plain language in order to confuse me! They must be laughing and call me stupid by now!”</p>\n<p>Hearing Lyla’s grievance, Bhela patted her head in order to let the girl calmed down.</p>\n<p>“Lyla, those girls are different than the noble girls that always making fun of you.”</p>\n<p>“Different? How so?”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at the girls who also was watching them back while fanning themselves with their fabulous feathered fans.</p>\n<p>“They looked like noble descendants, but actually were not.”</p>\n<p>“I still don’t like them nonetheless!”</p>\n<p>“You don’t have to talk to them if you don’t want to,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>Yet Lyla still restlessly tugging Bhela’s sleeves, making it harder for her to do her chores. Before the peers that always making fun of her, Lyla was always helpless and had been depending on Bhela’s figure as a shield. What it looked like from the point of view of an outsider was a scene where a young mother being tested of her patience dealing with a girl who was throwing a tantrum.</p>\n<p>Seeing that the young noble miss wouldn’t come back soon, the feathered fan girls approaching Bhela and Lyla instead.</p>\n<p>“Oh, fancy to meet Young Lady Bhela here, le banjour!”</p>\n<p>“Le bonjour…” Bhela hesitated to reply back. Tilting her head slightly, she studied the pompously dressed girls before her. These girls were relatives of Malikh Family’s elders. None of them could match with Bhela if talking strictly about social status wise, not to mention talents. However, while she was holding her broom, it looked like Bhela was the one with common origin, while these girls were floating swans who happened to be generous enough to greet plebeians with their <em>unique</em> vocabulary.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Lyla Blackwood hid behind Lyla’s back. Despite a noble origin herself, meeting more cocky and fake young ladies than the girls before her were rare experience for Lyla.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela, fancy to meet you. Good morning. The weather is nice. I eat snails everyday,” Elder Jhamil’s niece took the lead and said that with a hint of inflated pride.</p>\n<p>Bhela narrowed her eyes. She could see why Lyla instantly hated these girls. She then said in a sleek foreign language, “Je ne sais pas de quoi tu parles. Si vous ne parlez pas une langue étrangère, fermez simplement la bouche, sinon vous faites peur aux enfants avec votre non-sens.”</p>\n<p>The feathered fan girls blinked their eyes trying to decipher whatever Bhela had said.</p>\n<p>“Oh, it turns out Young Lady Bhela is aquadettely know some le banjour!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, Young Lady Bhela is adequately sophisticated after all. Me gusta!”</p>\n<p>“I see, I see, le pasta fortuna is delicosaza.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s niece didn’t say anything as she only maintained a sweet smile while being nervous herself. Racking her brains over remembering the contents of thick dictionary, she tried to form a decent sentences in foreign language. But Bhela then cut off her train of thought before she could say a word.</p>\n<p>“Blackwood Family is migrating noble that has long been making their roots here in southern land. Hundred of years living far away from their western peers, noble families like this would naturally become more lax. It’s natural for Lyla to not mastering her homeland’s native tongue.”</p>\n<p>Bhela said that in a straight manner. That was a white lie, however. It was true that many noble families coming from the western side of Tiramikal Continent to forgot their western root and began to see themselves as southerners. But those were usually the case depending right circumstances, like exiled nobles, or some young masters who had lost in political battle branched out and fancied themselves a legit noble family with themselves at the helm. Blackwood Family weren’t exiled nobles, and though Lyla’s ancestors branching out some hundreds of years ago, that didn’t automatically made them cutting off ties with the original family. The main family of Blackwood was back in a western country called Tatalghia Kingdom, still sending letters and envoys from time to time to the branch Lyla was living in--although, undeniably, the southern branch of Blackwood Family had long developed and surpassed the main one.</p>\n<p>It seemed like Bhela already used to tell this lie. Anyone who heard this would be forced to accept it, unless they wanted to spend time and resources digging through the details--which to be honest, none of these pompous young girls were willing or simply unable to go through.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Elder Jhamil’s niece believed Lyla’s family exempt her to excel in foreign language. Yet she was still displeased inside. Her uncle told her that Bhela had been hogging the young noble’s influence for herself, everyone in Malikh Family already knew how Bhela Malikh carrying around the noble young lady yesterday. So what if she had some more bit of talent and had been running around overseas in that whatever seminars she was attending? A bumpkin origin wouldn’t be able to change their bumpkin bloodline. So if Bhela had the right to get close with the Young Lady of Blackwood Family, that meant someone coming from the same family should have the same change as her!</p>\n<p>The elder’s niece said, “Young Lady Bhela, I know the main family is prideful. But Young Lady Blackwood is here to experience the village slow life. Don’t you think she also needs to mingle with us commoners?”</p>\n<p>“Lyla will befriend any person she fancies herself, I don’t control with whom she wants to socialize with,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“If that’s the case, then why she still has no friends other than you?”</p>\n<p>“That’s not true!” Lyla cried indignantly, “I’ve made friends! With aunties! Aunties in the kitchen!”</p>\n<p>It was easy to be friendly with Lyla. She was always unconventional and never saw people by the social system. To her, people only divided by two types, those who gave her food and those who didn’t. She was like a cat. Just bring a good food and she’d be very friendly the next moment.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Lyla’s frank open-mindedness wasn’t easily accepted by some people. Elder Jhamil’s niece gasped as she looked at Lyla and Bhela, back and forth. “My goodness! Young Lady Bhela, were you letting a noble young lady such as Young Lady Blackwood mingle with dirty servants?!”</p>\n<p>“Why wouldn’t I?” Bhela asked back.</p>\n<p>“You--don’t young lady care about our family’s reputation? What if people said we’ve mistreated a noble young lady?”</p>\n<p>“Lyla is here to experience village slow life,” Bhela said slowly, “don’t you think she also needs to mingle with commoners?”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s niece was speechless as Bhela used her own words. The contorted expression on her chaky make-up face brought satisfaction for Lyla, who then snorted.</p>\n<p>“What now? Kitty got your tongue?” Lyla said with her mouth pouted. “So that you know, Sis Bhela already made speechless many many bullies like you! Who were many many many times smarter than you! This is what you get by making fun of me--shame on you, hmph! Who’s the stupid one, now?”</p>\n<p>Even after losing a round of squabble against Young Lady Bhela, unexpectedly the nobly young lady herself became hostile against her. All was so sudden that it made blood drained from her face.</p>\n<p>Bhela ruffled Lyla’s hair. Apparently Lyla still believed these girls came to bully her. When Lyla already made up her mind to not liking someone, it was hard to bend on her opinion.</p>\n<p>“Let’s go, Lyla. We’ll help aunties make sweets for afternoon lunch,” Bhela said. Back in the seminars, when Bhela asked Lyla to do some chores, the supposed noble young lady of Blackwood Family would move slowly, occasionally pouting and murmuring some complaints, unwilling to exert her calories on some boring stuff. However, it was different if the destination was kitchen. The spirit of lively bunny would come to possess her--she’d jolt, sprinting, unwilling to waste time as the promise of free sweets and delicious salty snacks was revealed before her.</p>\n<p>“What was that about?!” one of the le bonjour girls scowled after Bhela and Lyla was gone. “How could a young lady speaks like that?”</p>\n<p>“Bhela must lead her around to act like that! Did you hear what she said? The noble young lady thinks we bully her or something.”</p>\n<p>“Aahhh! What a manipulative bitch! I really want to know what that little cunt said to make Young Lady Blackwood think we had made fun of her. No way in hell someone would dare making fun of a noble like her!”</p>\n<p>Actually, Lyla was made fun of so many times. Especially during her study in the seminars abroad. She made fun of so much that she formed a survival instinct to hide behind Bhela’s back. But they didn’t know that. They just assumed as a young lady coming from a noble family, Lyla Blackwood would be adequately pure noble in stories and gossip. The main reason Bhela brought Lyla away was so that Lyla didn’t have to mingle with these delusional le bonjour girls.</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-6/chapter-1-5":"<p>A fifteen years old boy played a game of chess against a spirit. Yesterday, he won a ghastly old encyclopedia nobody ever heard of. Today, the bet he eyed was silver coins. He didn’t know what he wanted from his opponent for tomorrow’s game. But the spirit in this dashing leather armor, adventurer-style, always wanted one thing for the game’s prize: taking control of the boy’s mortal body.</p>\n<p>More than a hundred games of chess later, the boy still got his healthy body intact, he never lost even once. And that made the spirit grow more dissatisfied as the days passing by.</p>\n<p>“Holy ff--! I clearly remember this damn bishop wasn’t there,” the spirit said. From the look of it, he was two moves away from getting his king owned.</p>\n<p>The boy clicked his tongue. He was hearing that kind of excuse every time the chess game came to its end.</p>\n<p>The spirit stubbornly closed the gap in his defense by sacrificing a rook. But soon, without taking a time to think, the boy casually moved his one horse, eating away the queen, sealing all the chance for the spirit to counter-attack.</p>\n<p>“Fuck this shit!!!”</p>\n<p>Enraged, the spirit flipped the chess board. About a dozen chess pieces hurled all side as they became the victims of the spirit’s frustration. The boy sighed. This was no good. Apparently he needed to be more considerate for the next game. He needed to pretend struggling before he crushed this impatient spirit so he didn’t feel cornered and ended up abandoning all these easy-money making games.</p>\n<p>“Hey,” the boy said. He tapped the flat-surfaced stone they used to lay the chess board before and reminded the spirit, almost as if he was saying “put the money here.”</p>\n<p>As annoyed as he was, the spirit could do nothing but give him a pouch of coins.</p>\n<p>“They are not kobes,” the boy said. “Shops and stalls in the village only accept kobe coins.”</p>\n<p>The spirit scoffed.</p>\n<p>“What do you know about it, brat. If you convert with the last week rate then you’ve got twice the shitty kobe you extort from me. Be glad about it.”</p>\n<p>“This won’t do, Ol’ Nalaq. The peddlers that come around here rarely accept strange currency. Neighbor country’s money is usually fine but I don’t think these coins would do. I don’t even know which country these coins are from.”</p>\n<p>“Then use it to add your savings,” the spirit said. “And don’t call me Nalaq. Don’t push your primitive tribal nonsense to me. Call me ‘Good-Natured Spirit’ as usual. I’m not like your usual Nalaqs, brat.”</p>\n<p>“It’s not tribal.” The boy didn’t show any sign of agreement. He didn’t know why this roguish-grinning spirit didn’t like to be called a Nalaq. The way southern Mossack people, like the boy himself, addressed spirits were usually by two terms: Nalaq and Selaq. As far as he knew Nalaq was a title worth to be proud of.</p>\n<novel-trivia label=”Lore”>\n<p>Nalaq were those of the spirit of fallen heroes and mages, had attained high-level of enlightenment to see ways to preserve souls across death. Whilst no longer to be alive, Nalaqs own their consciousness and retain their memories as well intelligence, though part of their original power diminished, especially those who relied on physical might during their prime.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Selaqs arose from death through unnatural causes, sometimes fueled by resentment and great energy of negativity. Though more powerful, their spirit didn’t dissipate because of strong, usually vile, emotions their harbour when they died, the restless spirits stuck in the limbo and returned back to the mortal world as hostile, mindless haunting spectres.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>Theoretically the spirit that currently playing chess was a Nalaq. He still got his consciousness, true. But, in a way, his intelligence seemed way apart from the Nalaqs southern Mossack tribes often revered in the past--that was what the boy had in mind when looking at this vulgar grinning spirit.</p>\n<p>“You’re not thinking something stupid about me, are you?” the spirit said with a snort as he realized the unexcited eyes the boy had as if he was looking at cow dung.</p>\n<p>“No, I was thinking just the usual--I was wondering about your very existence and your real identity.”</p>\n<p>“That so?” the spirit raised his chin. “Don’t need overthinking it, boy. Hehe. If you know even a piece of my name then you’d be amazed by how amazing I am. Everybody is my bitch when I’m still your age back then, hehe. That’s true.”</p>\n<p>“Hooohhh…” the boy half-heartedly nodded. As expected, every time he brought the topic about the spirit’s identity, all he got was empty talks, disgusting enough for him to regret for bringing up the topic. For now, the only joyous thing he got to do was counting the money he won from the chess game as the bullshit Good-Natured Spirit sang about his past tuning endlessly in the background.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Somewhere in Tiramikal Continent, far in the opposite side of the cold, barbaric northern lands, not too isolated from the bustling early-capitalistic empires of the western lands, and not too far away from the neighbor eastern lands of never-ending warfares between the eastern Kaya feudal lords, a village known as Badril Village was living peaceful for a number of years. The old blood the locals knew as Badril Village’s three big families rooted deeply these past one hundred years in spite of the thinning southern Mossack heritage. Despite slowly developing their rural village worthy of the westerner tourists and easterners refugees, the southern locals still taking pride in their Mossack hunters and gatherers ancestry. Exactly one year ago Good-Natured Spirit appeared in this humble village.󠆞</p>\n<p>On the wall of Yashura Family’s courtyard, which was ridiculously thick and tall for ordinary villages, the spirit took out a rolled paper of dried tobacco. This might not be common knowledge known only to limited people; for converting earthly materials to spiritual goods for Nalaqs to use, it could only be done in an expensive and complicated manner--usually performed in rituals by the royalties and great ancient clans for annual offerings to their ancestors. But the spirit in shabby leather armor did the converting for cigarettes and other trivial goods. Nobody knew how he did it. Even if they did, it’d be very hard to judge whether his quirk was worth to be admired or to be ridiculed at. Nevertheless he got this kind of air around him that telling people he didn’t care much about what they think.</p>\n<p>The street below the wall were children below ages of ten playing with sticks and chasing each other. When a crowd of housewives came, his eyes, sharp as an eagle’s, sweeping through in search of prey. One of his habit that obviously he brought with him since he was alive was to oogle women, especially for young wives and pretty middle-aged aunties interesting big breasts and interesting big butts. Despite his sighing and occasional annoying tongue-clicking, though, those wives and children didn’t turn their heads toward him. They didn’t even know a lecher ghost was there haunting the street. A Nalaq couldn’t be seen by common folks by default. Unless he wanted to, no one would realize there was a suspicious spirit ogling for women that were passing by.</p>\n<p>There was a young woman he knew trotted the street. Good-Natured Spirit knew her. She was neither a wife nor she was an aunty. Her butt and breasts sizes were also not worth being fusing about. The name was Mila Yashura, seventeen years old since last month. She was the older cousin of the boy he lost playing chess to.</p>\n<p>“Aunty,” Mila greeted an aunty by lowering her head, “did you see my cousin Shira around here?”</p>\n<p>The local wife she asked shook her head. Mila Yashura said a polite thanks and continued searching for her cousin.</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit swept the street with his eyes, looking for something. When he saw a certain manservant he stopped. Using his spiritual knife, he dismantled a small pebble from the stone wall he sat on, flicked it using his thumb and knocked the manservant’s head with it.</p>\n<p>“Ouch!” the manservant cried.</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura abruptly turned her head and saw a manservant of her Yashura Family holding his head. She briskly coming to him and asked the same question she threw to the aunty before.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira?” the manservant glanced at the direction of the hill behind Yashura Family’s wall. “I saw him walking there at noon. But whether he has returned or not I don’t know.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you. That’s good enough. Here, treat yourself some coffee beans before the peddlers set for the next village.”</p>\n<p>The hill behind the Yashura Family’s dwelling was originally a place where the family members brought the family’s goats to graze its green grasses. But under the current patriarch’s management, the family’s fortunate mostly put on investing on coconut plantations, thus some grazing places were left unused.</p>\n<p>“Shira! So here’s you holing yourself. I’ve been searching you for nearly an hour,” Mila saw how her cousin who was two years younger than her enjoying himself lying under a shadowy tree, using his arms as pillows. She kicked his foot, yelling him to get up, but Shira merely changed his position and groaned in protest.</p>\n<p>“This buffon…” Mila hissed. “You know how the fact you’re lazing around everyday breeds all those crappy rumors, don’t you?”</p>\n<p>“People can talk whatever they want as long as they don’t bother me,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“But they bother our family!”</p>\n<p>Mila inhaling a deep breath. Now her voice getting higher annoyingly and she continued, “You’re the young master of our family, you lazy pig. The nearest in-line to inherit the patriarch title! You may don’t give a shit about your reputation now but if you are to take the leader's mantle from my father then all the crap they said would certainly bite your ass in the future! You hear?!”</p>\n<p>Shira picked his ear coolly. He might not know anything about the future, but certainly his cousin’s annoying nagging was biting his ass at this moment.</p>\n<p>“What are you doing alone in this kind of place anyway?”</p>\n<p>“You might not believe it, but I’m making a fortune here,” Shira said. Of course, whenever he played a game of chess with a spirit invisible to ordinary humans, he needed a quiet place where nobody was around. This was a perfect place for him.</p>\n<p>But Mila winced her eyes. A few seconds later, she turned her head, catching a canvas filled with rough sketches resting on the tree.</p>\n<p>“By painting?”</p>\n<p>“Sometimes that too.” Shira knew a bit about drawing scenery and people, so even with his limited interpersonal connection as an introvert he could make some money with his painting. However, his casual reply got Mila in a bad mood instead. Suddenly Shira remembered the embarrassing accident two months ago when Mila found an unfinished commision from a certain good-for-nothing spirit that he had carefully hidden in his house. When people commissioned a no-name painter they mostly asked for a portrait or image they deemed interesting. What kind of images Good-Natured Spirit found interesting? Women, of course. Especially those with big butts and big breasts. He liked them in thin, slipping clothings as if those vulnerable ladies were stuck in a very dangerous situation. In other words, erotic paintings.</p>\n<p>Then, sighing at the explosive nagging coming his way, Shira took a stick he slipped on his right ear and presented it as a bribe. Ancient southern Mossacks used berries and some used squid inks as pigments, but after waves of outside influence they started using quills and brushes, depending on the regions. Pencils, although practical, were introduced by a certain Nalaq spirit and Shira hadn’t heard anyone using it beside himself. The stick he used as a bribe was exactly a pencil. It sharpened many times and half-way on its way before he needed another one. Shira thought, maybe he should extort some more pencils for the next match from Good-Natured Spirit.</p>\n<p>Mila furrowed. She knew about the pencil and its value not too long ago thus, as expected, she grabbed it shamelessly. “What? Do you think you can escape only with this?”</p>\n<p>“I planned to give you something else but I think you’d rather like this simple bribe anyway.”</p>\n<p>Shira wanted to simply give her money to make her shut up. But the coins he had on him now only in form of foreign currency--the coins he extorted from Good-Natured Spirit from the last chess game. The boy frowned. Beside nagging him at full force, what did Mila coming here for?</p>\n<p>“Yeah, that reminds me, the news I wanted to tell you!” Mila finally snapped out of her nagging mode. “That Malikh girl! Your fiancée! After two years abroad! She’s finally coming home!”</p>\n<p>“Ohh…” the reply was anticlimactic.</p>\n<p>“Ohh? What the fuck with that reply?”</p>\n<p>“You don’t mind me. I just already burn out when people compare me with her,” Shira said. Although their age were the same, this young lady of Malikh Family was famous even in the nearby villages and town as a talent, with a promising look that might make her a beauty worth dying for. The old generations called her treasure and the boys loved her as the village princess. She went abroad two years ago for a series of seminars after an official from the capital scouted her talent. Now that she returned, everybody was fervently talking about her. But for Shira Yashura, the boy who was supposed to be the fiancé, even that kind of news wasn’t enough to make him get up from his comfortable napping.</p>\n<p>“My father wants to talk with you,” Mila said, “get up now.”</p>\n<p>“What about?”</p>\n<p>“You still asking?”</p>\n<p>The boy had a premonition that a troublesome matter would be waiting for him. Mila gave him an ultimatum before she wandered off to do her own things.</p>\n<p>“Hehe, what’s this fiancée I heard just now?” Good-Natured Spirit popped out his head from a tree beside Shira.</p>\n<p>“It’s not what you think,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“Oh yeah?” Good-Natured Spirit nudged the boy with his elbow. “I heard that chick is a hella beauty. Hehe, I bet her luggages is in good-quality, you know what I mean?”</p>\n<p>“From whom did you hear that?”</p>\n<p>“Doesn’t matter who. When it comes to chick my radar is very sensitive, eh. I’m curious. Did you benefit from this engagement thingy? Benefit, know what I mean?”</p>\n<p>Shira clicked his tongue. “Like I said, it’s not what you think it is. Our parents set us up and it’s been a mess since the talks about engagement got out.”</p>\n<p>Talking some sense to this good-for-nothing Nalaq was futile. Good-Natured Spirit kept teasing him. “You haven’t seen her for two years, have you? The talks I’ve been hearing down there real hairy, brat. I mean… especially those luggages of hers, know what I mean? Know what I mean? Nudge nudge. Nudge nudge,” he winked. “Wanna check on her?”</p>\n<p>“I need to go back. My uncle wants to talk with me.”</p>\n<p>“Alright then,” Good-Natured Spirit nodded as he rubbed his chin. “I’ll check the chick myself.”</p>\n<p>Carrying the canvas and the chess with him, Shira warned the Nalaq, “You better not do anything funny to her, hear me?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho. Jealous?”</p>\n<p>“I just don’t want their entire family coming right after me with pitchforks just because yo do something stupid.”</p>\n<p>After he said that Shira Yashura turned around. He started to walk down the hill. Good-Natured Spirit saw the boy walk without caring for the world, then he set off to check the girl by himself with a chuckle that escaped from his mouth.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A few hours later the said fiancée showed herself in a public training field. The field, owned by the most influential family in Badril Village--the Elzhier Family--was neatly arranged with archery targets and provided with dulled swords for the teenagers trained themselves or doing mock battles. The Elzhiers sent some menservants occasionally to act as security in case conflicts would occur. Today, the young master of the said family himself, nicknamed Bony, guarded the entrance along with two of his lackeys.</p>\n<p>“I’ve got to pay you to enter?!” a young man gawked at the sudden irregularity regarding the training field’s rules. “What’s this? The field is supposed to be free for everyone!”</p>\n<p>“Well, man, gotta pay for maintenance cost,” one of the lackeys, called Pilek, said as he rubbed his nose.</p>\n<p>“One silver kobe! Heh, maintenance cost my ass! Nobody would pay for this bullshit.”</p>\n<p>“Nobody? You wrong, man,” another lackey called Polio pointed at the crowd inside the training field with a gesture of his head. The girl from the Malikh Family causing a big ruckus from her arrival alone. She attracted boys like a bright lamp attracted fireflies. Because of that, the three deliquents in the entrance for nearly half an hour had been amassing quite a fortune till now.</p>\n<p>“I’ll definitely send complaints to Elzhier Family now. Just because your father is the village head you think you can do whatever you want, eh?” the young man snorted, sending a glare to them.</p>\n<p>The Elzhier Family’s young master, who had been watching with his back resting on the wall and his arms crossed, decided to open his mouth, he said, “Pay or get lost.”</p>\n<p>“Hear that? Boss Bony has spoken,” Pilek glared back at the young man with his head tilted. “Better get lost now or else…”</p>\n<p>“Or else!” Polio emphasized with a higher voice.</p>\n<p>The three of them had been infamous in the village despite being heirs to their respective families. Naturally, though they were the same age, only an idiot would butting head directly with the heir of Elzhier Family. Thus the young man snorted, unwillingly turned and walked away.</p>\n<p>“What the heck is that?” Pilek didn’t like the way that young man snorted at them. “We should teach bastards like him a few good lessons one of these days.”</p>\n<p>“You’re right,” Polio added.</p>\n<p>“Just ignore that bum,” Bony said.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, the next onlookers came. Not boys, but two girls to be exact. They carried bags of dirty clothes with them as they were on their way to wash the clothes at the river.</p>\n<p>“Well, I’d be damned,” one of the girls, a young lady named Romana, said, “I’ve been hearing about the rumors but looking at that Malikh girl, damn…. Look at how she did with her hair, Mila.”</p>\n<p>They could see what was happening in the field even from the entrance. The two girls looked at a certain girl who was surrounded by boys. The other girl, Mila Yashura, furrowed her brows at the current appearance of her cousin’s fiancée. She kept her mouth shut despite the anger on her eyes.</p>\n<p>“She cut her hair short despite being engaged to your cousin,” Romana said to Mila. “What’s that supposed to mean?”</p>\n<p>It was a custom of southern Mossack people for women to cut their hair short to tell the opposite sex they currently unavailable. Mostly widows who weren’t ready to be courted again chose to cut their hair that way. However, since the young lady of Malikh Family was currently engaged, the act of cutting her hair short was confusing to people.</p>\n<p>From the three delinquents who had been hearing their conversations, Pilek butted in, “Yo, ladies, don’t think too much about it. We southern people been foreigners with this fiancé-and-fiancée business. We practical people, y’know? Southerners the kind of people who would do it first then talking ‘bout marriage later. A chance she might not know what she was doing.”</p>\n<p>Romana rolled her eyes. Knowing Mila Yashura was here, she wished this stupid cheerful delinquent wouldn’t say what he had said. In fact, better for him to not open his mouth. She hated him whenever he opened his mouth and said pointless things.</p>\n<p>Her and Mila’s goal was to check about the rumor regarding the fiancée’s short hair. They didn’t have the intention to enter the training field and mingle with those crowdy horny boys, lest talking with these shameless thugs who clearly act as bandits.</p>\n<p>“Let’s go, Mila,” Romana whispered as she realized Mila had been glaring at the three delinquents. Moving her eyes from Mila, she looked at Bony who was in between his two lackeys. She whispered again, “you can’t fight him like you used to. He got a Knight class now. People said he can even fight another Knight with four level above him. Let’s just forget about it.”</p>\n<p>Last time Mila and Bony fought was three years ago. Her punch made his nose bleed but that was the end of it. It was a hot topic for a while and most didn’t know what happened but the long enmity between the two of them suddenly dropped cold and they had been avoiding each other. Seeing how the other party was quite well, Mila Yashura grimaced. They were Novices back then but now, after both of them ascended the first level barrier and got themselves class titles, there was no way a support-class Specialist like her could deliver that kind of punch again to his face.</p>\n<p>“Mm. Let’s go,” Mila said to Romana. No matter how brave and reckless she was, as a non-combatant talent, she knew better than to sow another discord with the village’s young generation’s strongest.</p>\n<p>Pilek, the most cheerful in Bony’s group, who was actually the most friendly, waved his hand to the girls as they walked away. Neither of them bothered with him.</p>\n<p>“Ahhh, my sister’s been avoiding me lately,” Pilek grumbled. Romana, Mila’s friend, was actually his half-sister from different mother. He was a proud big brother when they were young, until their mothers had a fight and his half-sister moved into a separate house.</p>\n<p>“Pilek,” Bony called.</p>\n<p>“Yes boss?”</p>\n<p>“You should’ve kept your mouth shut.”</p>\n<p>Pilek wryly smiled and nodded. Polio also thought his friend Pilek couldn’t read between the line. Although Pilek’s remark was well-intentioned, it’d just make things worse for Bony. The bad mood from back three years ago still left after taste that made him and her uncomfortable dealing with each other.</p>\n<p>After that, more people were coming to see the young lady of Malikh Family.</p>\n<p>The talks and speculations about her hair made the boys think she was dissatisfied with her engagement with Shira Yashura. Thus giving them hopes to snatch her away. It was no exaggeration to say that most of the boys fell for her, especially after they saw how the young lady grew beautifully. They surrounded this girl who had this icy expression on her face, though she herself greatly concentrated on holding a bow and an arrow, eyes straight to the archery target dozens of meters from her. She shot. And when the arrow hit splendidly, the boys would cheer and fawn all over her. The girl kept her face cold despite the flooding flattery coming at her way.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” a young man in his early twenty stepped forward from the bunch of admirers and confidently said, “I see you have this different aura about you. Something special that I can’t quite get my fingers on it, and I can’t help but feel curious about you.”</p>\n<p>That was supposed to be a pick-up line, but Bhela Malikh replied straightforwardly, “I changed. Now I’m Level 10 and not a Novice anymore.”</p>\n<p>“Oooohhhh!!” the crowd was surprised. Reaching the first barrier and got a class title at fifteen years old was the second time in these two decades. The first one was Bony. However, considering the girl was quite a talent enough for people in the capital to notice her, there was a high chance for her to snatch the crown as Badril Village’s young generation’s strongest from Bony sooner than everyone expected.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” the young man called for her attention again, despite his first attempt at hitting on her was an utter failure. “I see your beautiful sharp eyes and beautiful nimble hands and your beautiful pretty face. The class you’ve got must be… a beautiful <b>Archer</b>, right?”</p>\n<p>“I am an archer,” Bhela replied tight-lipped. Well, it was obvious when she picked a bow the first thing she arrived here.</p>\n<p>“Ah, a beautiful and talented Archer then! It’s a pity, though for such a fine beautiful flower like yourself to be thrown into a heap of cow dung…”</p>\n<p>The remark made Bhela Malikh raise her brows. She somehow could predict where the topic was going to be directed.</p>\n<p>“That stupid engagement is what I say! How could a diamond such as yourself be forced to marry a trash from Yashura Family?”</p>\n<p>He sighed like he pitied the harsh fate of the beauty. And though unlikeable as he was, the murmurs of the crowd seemingly agreed with him. At that point, someone said, “That’s true. Even my ten years old nephew is one Level above him. Such trash to become…”</p>\n<p>The words stopped, Bhela looked at the person who said that. “The one from Yashura Family--he’s still a Level 3 Novice?”</p>\n<p>It was someone else who replied to her question. “Ah, yes, he’s stuck and made no progress even since Young Lady Bhela went outside the village. Everyone calls him The Eternal Novice.”</p>\n<p>And this made her raised brows turned into a frown. Going by the crowd, for a Level 5 Novice by fifteen years old was already considered slow progress even by the standard of rural places like Badril Village. Mostly at that age the youngsters already reached Level 7, the diligent ones could reach Level 8 with hard work. Faster than that, not counting usage of an unreasonable amount of growth-hack potions--which most children from rich noble families did, could be considered a talent amongst the younger generation. However, to think of a boy one year before his own coming-of-age ceremony coming still stuck at such low-level talent, even though if he was the heir of Badril Village’s major families, people would still call him trash, even in public.</p>\n<p>“Ah, Young Lady Bhela! You don’t have to bother yourself with such eyesore trash. I know you’re troubled with the careless arrangement your father made, but if we put our mind to it, we can--”</p>\n<p>All was well until the young man put bad words about her father. Never did he expect that the girl would mercilessly retract her hand just before the tips of their fingers touched.</p>\n<p>“Please don’t pretend you were familiar with me,” that was what she said.</p>\n<p>The rain of snickers rang all around him. Despite him glaring left and right in an intimidating manner, there was no way for him to suppress the crowd from humiliating him further. At the time he realized the chance for him to court the Young Lady of Malikh Family, the sole daughter of the Malikh Family Patriarch, was pitifully close to nothing. Thus, in a moment of spontaneity, he thought of a scheme to save his face and sounded it with a flash of desperate smirk plastered on his face. He grabbed a bow and said, “I see Young Lady Bhela rather reserved toward us long friends after two years abroad. Hmm, yeah, this is a perfect chance, by the way. I’m an Archer too, see. So why not this senior teach you a thing or two? Seventy meters--perhaps a good learning experience for young lady, no?”</p>\n<p>The surrounding began chattering lively. It was obvious it was a challenge as Archers. And the young man’s smirk turned more and more confident at the girl’s unresponsiveness. No matter how much potential talent one had, time and experience playing a vital role in assessing one’s current performance whether she was Archer or Priest or Knight or other classes. Skills, abilities one acquired after reaching the first barrier and getting a new class title could only progress with constant tempering in battle and improved alongside one’s level. The young man was a Level 12 Archer. So theoretically, a Level 10 new Archer like Bhela Malikh would need a few more years before she could beat the opponent in a fair competition.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh was annoyed. She glared at the ones who were supposed to be guarding the field. But Bony and his lackeys were busy counting coins. For Bhela, the crowd were a bunch of stupid annoying busybodies who prevented her to train in peace. But for Bony and his lackeys the crowd was simply a bunch of gold mines.</p>\n<p>“Please watch closely how I do it, Young Lady Bhela. See my elbow? If you could do the same way I do it, I’m sure your archery skill would improve significantly.”</p>\n<p>No one really bothered with the ‘humble direction’ the young man spouted. Bhela didn’t spare him a glance. She looked straight to target seventy meters from where she was standing. Repressing his anger, the young man began to shoot three arrows one by one splendidly; the final one landed right in the center of the target that was marked in red dot.</p>\n<p>He was satisfied with the result. Glancing at the young lady, this young man wanted to utter more words to improve his image. However, right before he opened his mouth, he found Bhela already drew her arrow, released it, and it hit one arrow splendidly. Not just hitting the target, but an arrow the young man previously shot. The second was the same. And the final third arrow also hit the arrow on the red dot.</p>\n<p>What was that? She used a skill? The young man wanted to object but his tongue froze and his lips quivered. Did she use <b>Far Sight</b> skill that enhanced eye-sight a hundred of meters away? Did she use <b>Boost Accuracy</b>, the skill that was supposedly forbidden to be used in duel between Archers? To think of beating him, an Archer older than her and 2 Level right above her, in such a devastating manner… she must be cheating, right?</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” the defeated young man said weakly, “I didn’t use my mana between my shots.”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh nodded.</p>\n<p>“Neither was I.”</p>\n<p>With that, Bhela turned around and left the crowd of dumbfounded boys with steps full of grace. She approached the entrance, returned back the bow she used to the three delinquents who just let people mess with her training and said coldly, “If this is how the famous Young Master Elzhier manages his property, then there’s no need for me to come here again. Please excuse me.”</p>\n<p>Bony’s expression didn’t change much as he still crossed his arms and rested his back casually on the wall.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Pilek, the one received the returned bow from Bhela, waved his hand again and shouted, “Take care, princess!”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Because she couldn’t train her archery peacefully in public, Bhela returned back to Malikh Family and trained in her private training place.</p>\n<p>It was originally a backyard turned archery ground, made by Malikh Family Patriarch after knowing his daughter showed interest in archery. It was nothing fancy. It was spacious and good enough when she started with her first bow but now Bhela felt the place was lacking. At most, she had to live with the meager fifty meters range maximum. Therefore, the practice she had made a habit of had to wait.</p>\n<p>Therefore, Bhela Malikh decided to put her mind over something else than her usual practice instead.</p>\n<p>She drew a deep breath. A table was provided with dozens of arrows laid on top of it. Bhela picked four at the same time, nocked them on her bow string. She began to aim.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the air surrounding her changed. Her inexperience as a newly Novice-graduate showed by the obvious mana that leaked from the inside out. With naked eyes, her mana looked calm colorful haze that consisted of four bold colors, tangling and struggling with each other for dominance. Her eyelashes quivered. Channeling mana to cast a skill she yet had mastered felt like trying to stand on the raging sea waves while she herself was being a weak newborn.</p>\n<p><em>Whhhhuuuuushh--</em></p>\n<p><em>Shuuuhsh--</em></p>\n<p><em>Ssshhhuuuush--</em></p>\n<p><em>Wwhuuuussh!!</em></p>\n<p>The fastest arrow, coated with sparking yellow-colored mana, hit one of the targets at around forty meters range. But the others performed pitifully. The one infused with wet blue-colored mana didn’t even reach two-third of the desired range. The green-colored one, an arrow infused with mana that generated unstable wind trajectory flew far far away, as if it was getting swallowed by the sky, never to be seen again. The last one, the red-colored arrow, was horrifying. It hit the training ground fence instead the target. The bamboo fences suddenly set ablaze by raging flames as soon as the said arrow came into contact with them.</p>\n<p><em>Clap clap clap!</em></p>\n<p>Uninvited claps resounded across the training ground. On the wall Good-Natured Spirit clapping after watching a good spectacle. For getting hand claps from a Nalaq like him, naturally the level of talent Bhela showed just now was far beyond ordinary.</p>\n<p>“Thank you…” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>It appeared she knew beforehand the four-arrows skill she shot would make a mess. So she gathered the maidservants and made them extinguish the fences that started to burn into ashes. “Thank you, thank you for your hard work,” she said to a pair of maidservants who briskly went back and forth to kill the fire before its spread.</p>\n<p>“Ah! Young lady, what skill was that just now?” one of the maidservants gawked after the fire was extinguished.</p>\n<p>“That wasn’t just your ordinary Archer skill, was it?” added the other.</p>\n<p>Summoning a blazing fire just with an arrow and pure mana was unheard of. At least, the maidservants knew nobody in the village could do that.</p>\n<p>Bhela drank a glass of murky liquify herbs mixed with mint to cool down her manasphere. “It’s something I learned when I was away,” she said after putting down the glass on the tray her maid servants provided. She continued, “I still can’t master it, though.”</p>\n<p>She cast her eyes at the unharmed targets one by one. Shooting at forty meters range was still too much for her using four arrows at the same time. When the maidservants realized her difficulty, they encouraged her to simplify it and shoot one arrow at a time. However at their suggestion, Bhela shook her head. “It’s the requirement of this skill I’ve got to shoot four arrows,” she explained.</p>\n<p>The maidservants nodded at her words and apologized for their shallow suggestion.</p>\n<p>“Don’t mind that,” Bhela waved her hand. “There’s something I heard from people, by the way. Something about Young Master Yashura.”</p>\n<p>The two maidservants glanced at each other before one of them replied. “The rumor says… he holed up from the public’s view because he’s ashamed he can’t even become a Level 4 Novice.”</p>\n<p>“Are the Yashura Family elders still favoring him as the heir of Yashura Family Patriarch?”</p>\n<p>“We don’t know whether they still favor him or not. But Yashura Family always united in their standing. So unless the current Patriarch of Yashura Family has a son, the Young Master Shira Yashura will undoubtedly become the next patriarch.”</p>\n<p>“No rumors about the Yashura Family elders wavering then?”</p>\n<p>The maidservants shook their heads altogether.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela… apologize for giving you my shallow suggestion once again but…” one of the maidservants came near to Bhela and whispered, “With him as the heir, Yashura Family’s future will be bleak. Everyone in our family said your father’s bad condition is a bad omen for us mingling with those simple Yashuras. I’m very sorry if this sounds impudent--but you should’ve better cut ties with them before too late, young lady. Madam was too grieved by your father’s ill health to make decisions thus the only one who can save our Malikh Family is you.”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at the maidservant. The glint on her eyes changed.</p>\n<p>“There’s already a plan laid to help our Malikh Family,” that was all Bhela said. “You better not say something like that again. You lucky no one here beside me to hear you utter that kind of words.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you for your mercy, young lady! We are sorry for being impudent!”</p>\n<p>They decided to make it history with only the four of them who knew the previous conversation. The four of them; the young lady and two maid servants and one Nalaq spirit who came here uninvited.</p>\n<p>“It seems I just heard something I shouldn’t hear,” Good-Natured Spirit said while he rubbed his chin. He came here peeking. He didn’t have the intention to reveal himself while the girls below had a secret conversation ignorant of his presence.</p>\n<p>After that Bhela continued with light training. Good-Natured Spirit watched her doing simple shooting, she didn’t even use a slightest of her mana from then on. Yawning, Good-Natured Spirit stood up. Then he flew away from Malikh Family and began to look for some other interesting thing to sate his boredom.</p>\n<hr>\n<authors-note id=\"Radhy\">\n<p>Testing, testing.

Yesterday, he won a ghastly old encyclopedia nobody ever heard of. Today, the bet he eyed was silver coins. He didn’t know what he wanted from his opponent for tomorrow’s game. But the spirit in this dashing leather armor, adventurer-style, always wanted one thing for the game’s prize: taking control of the boy’s mortal body.</p>\n<p>More than a hundred games of chess later, the boy still got his healthy body intact, he never lost even once. And that made the spirit grow more dissatisfied as the days passing by.</p>\n<p>“Holy ff--! I clearly remember this damn bishop wasn’t there,” the spirit said. From the look of it, he was two moves away from getting his king owned.</p>\n<p>The boy clicked his tongue. He was hearing that kind of excuse every time the chess game came to its end.</p>\n<p>The spirit stubbornly closed the gap in his defense by sacrificing a rook. But soon, without taking a time to think, the boy casually moved his one horse, eating away the queen, sealing all the chance for the spirit to counter-attack.</p>\n<p>“Fuck this shit!!!”</p>\n<p>Enraged, the spirit flipped the chess board. About a dozen chess pieces hurled all side as they became the victims of the spirit’s frustration. The boy sighed. This was no good. Apparently he needed to be more considerate for the next game. He needed to pretend struggling before he crushed this impatient spirit so he didn’t feel cornered and ended up abandoning all these easy-money making games.</p>\n<p>“Hey,” the boy said. He tapped the flat-surfaced stone they used to lay the chess board before and reminded the spirit, almost as if he was saying “put the money here.”</p>\n<p>As annoyed as he was, the spirit could do nothing but give him a pouch of coins.</p>\n<p>“They are not kobes,” the boy said. “Shops and stalls in the village only accept kobe coins.”</p>\n<p>The spirit scoffed.</p>\n<p>“What do you know about it, brat. If you convert with the last week rate then you’ve got twice the shitty kobe you extort from me. Be glad about it.”</p>\n<p>“This won’t do, Ol’ Nalaq. The peddlers that come around here rarely accept strange currency. Neighbor country’s money is usually fine but I don’t think these coins would do. I don’t even know which country these coins are from.”</p>\n<p>“Then use it to add your savings,” the spirit said. “And don’t call me Nalaq. Don’t push your primitive tribal nonsense to me. Call me ‘Good-Natured Spirit’ as usual. I’m not like your usual Nalaqs, brat.”</p>\n<p>“It’s not tribal.” The boy didn’t show any sign of agreement. He didn’t know why this roguish-grinning spirit didn’t like to be called a Nalaq. The way southern Mossack people, like the boy himself, addressed spirits were usually by two terms: Nalaq and Selaq. As far as he knew Nalaq was a title worth to be proud of.</p>\n<novel-trivia label=”Lore”>\n<p>Nalaq were those of the spirit of fallen heroes and mages, had attained high-level of enlightenment to see ways to preserve souls across death. Whilst no longer to be alive, Nalaqs own their consciousness and retain their memories as well intelligence, though part of their original power diminished, especially those who relied on physical might during their prime.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Selaqs arose from death through unnatural causes, sometimes fueled by resentment and great energy of negativity. Though more powerful, their spirit didn’t dissipate because of strong, usually vile, emotions their harbour when they died, the restless spirits stuck in the limbo and returned back to the mortal world as hostile, mindless haunting spectres.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>Theoretically the spirit that currently playing chess was a Nalaq. He still got his consciousness, true. But, in a way, his intelligence seemed way apart from the Nalaqs southern Mossack tribes often revered in the past--that was what the boy had in mind when looking at this vulgar grinning spirit.</p>\n<p>“You’re not thinking something stupid about me, are you?” the spirit said with a snort as he realized the unexcited eyes the boy had as if he was looking at cow dung.</p>\n<p>“No, I was thinking just the usual--I was wondering about your very existence and your real identity.”</p>\n<p>“That so?” the spirit raised his chin. “Don’t need overthinking it, boy. Hehe. If you know even a piece of my name then you’d be amazed by how amazing I am. Everybody is my bitch when I’m still your age back then, hehe. That’s true.”</p>\n<p>“Hooohhh…” the boy half-heartedly nodded. As expected, every time he brought the topic about the spirit’s identity, all he got was empty talks, disgusting enough for him to regret for bringing up the topic. For now, the only joyous thing he got to do was counting the money he won from the chess game as the bullshit Good-Natured Spirit sang about his past tuning endlessly in the background.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Somewhere in Tiramikal Continent, far in the opposite side of the cold, barbaric northern lands, not too isolated from the bustling early-capitalistic empires of the western lands, and not too far away from the neighbor eastern lands of never-ending warfares between the eastern Kaya feudal lords, a village known as Badril Village was living peaceful for a number of years. The old blood the locals knew as Badril Village’s three big families rooted deeply these past one hundred years in spite of the thinning southern Mossack heritage. Despite slowly developing their rural village worthy of the westerner tourists and easterners refugees, the southern locals still taking pride in their Mossack hunters and gatherers ancestry. Exactly one year ago Good-Natured Spirit appeared in this humble village.󠆞</p>\n<p>On the wall of Yashura Family’s courtyard, which was ridiculously thick and tall for ordinary villages, the spirit took out a rolled paper of dried tobacco. This might not be common knowledge known only to limited people; for converting earthly materials to spiritual goods for Nalaqs to use, it could only be done in an expensive and complicated manner--usually performed in rituals by the royalties and great ancient clans for annual offerings to their ancestors. But the spirit in shabby leather armor did the converting for cigarettes and other trivial goods. Nobody knew how he did it. Even if they did, it’d be very hard to judge whether his quirk was worth to be admired or to be ridiculed at. Nevertheless he got this kind of air around him that telling people he didn’t care much about what they think.</p>\n<p>The street below the wall were children below ages of ten playing with sticks and chasing each other. When a crowd of housewives came, his eyes, sharp as an eagle’s, sweeping through in search of prey. One of his habit that obviously he brought with him since he was alive was to oogle women, especially for young wives and pretty middle-aged aunties interesting big breasts and interesting big butts. Despite his sighing and occasional annoying tongue-clicking, though, those wives and children didn’t turn their heads toward him. They didn’t even know a lecher ghost was there haunting the street. A Nalaq couldn’t be seen by common folks by default. Unless he wanted to, no one would realize there was a suspicious spirit ogling for women that were passing by.</p>\n<p>There was a young woman he knew trotted the street. Good-Natured Spirit knew her. She was neither a wife nor she was an aunty. Her butt and breasts sizes were also not worth being fusing about. The name was Mila Yashura, seventeen years old since last month. She was the older cousin of the boy he lost playing chess to.</p>\n<p>“Aunty,” Mila greeted an aunty by lowering her head, “did you see my cousin Shira around here?”</p>\n<p>The local wife she asked shook her head. Mila Yashura said a polite thanks and continued searching for her cousin.</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit swept the street with his eyes, looking for something. When he saw a certain manservant he stopped. Using his spiritual knife, he dismantled a small pebble from the stone wall he sat on, flicked it using his thumb and knocked the manservant’s head with it.</p>\n<p>“Ouch!” the manservant cried.</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura abruptly turned her head and saw a manservant of her Yashura Family holding his head. She briskly coming to him and asked the same question she threw to the aunty before.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira?” the manservant glanced at the direction of the hill behind Yashura Family’s wall. “I saw him walking there at noon. But whether he has returned or not I don’t know.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you. That’s good enough. Here, treat yourself some coffee beans before the peddlers set for the next village.”</p>\n<p>The hill behind the Yashura Family’s dwelling was originally a place where the family members brought the family’s goats to graze its green grasses. But under the current patriarch’s management, the family’s fortunate mostly put on investing on coconut plantations, thus some grazing places were left unused.</p>\n<p>“Shira! So here’s you holing yourself. I’ve been searching you for nearly an hour,” Mila saw how her cousin who was two years younger than her enjoying himself lying under a shadowy tree, using his arms as pillows. She kicked his foot, yelling him to get up, but Shira merely changed his position and groaned in protest.</p>\n<p>“This buffon…” Mila hissed. “You know how the fact you’re lazing around everyday breeds all those crappy rumors, don’t you?”</p>\n<p>“People can talk whatever they want as long as they don’t bother me,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“But they bother our family!”</p>\n<p>Mila inhaling a deep breath. Now her voice getting higher annoyingly and she continued, “You’re the young master of our family, you lazy pig. The nearest in-line to inherit the patriarch title! You may don’t give a shit about your reputation now but if you are to take the leader's mantle from my father then all the crap they said would certainly bite your ass in the future! You hear?!”</p>\n<p>Shira picked his ear coolly. He might not know anything about the future, but certainly his cousin’s annoying nagging was biting his ass at this moment.</p>\n<p>“What are you doing alone in this kind of place anyway?”</p>\n<p>“You might not believe it, but I’m making a fortune here,” Shira said. Of course, whenever he played a game of chess with a spirit invisible to ordinary humans, he needed a quiet place where nobody was around. This was a perfect place for him.</p>\n<p>But Mila winced her eyes. A few seconds later, she turned her head, catching a canvas filled with rough sketches resting on the tree.</p>\n<p>“By painting?”</p>\n<p>“Sometimes that too.” Shira knew a bit about drawing scenery and people, so even with his limited interpersonal connection as an introvert he could make some money with his painting. However, his casual reply got Mila in a bad mood instead. Suddenly Shira remembered the embarrassing accident two months ago when Mila found an unfinished commision from a certain good-for-nothing spirit that he had carefully hidden in his house. When people commissioned a no-name painter they mostly asked for a portrait or image they deemed interesting. What kind of images Good-Natured Spirit found interesting? Women, of course. Especially those with big butts and big breasts. He liked them in thin, slipping clothings as if those vulnerable ladies were stuck in a very dangerous situation. In other words, erotic paintings.</p>\n<p>Then, sighing at the explosive nagging coming his way, Shira took a stick he slipped on his right ear and presented it as a bribe. Ancient southern Mossacks used berries and some used squid inks as pigments, but after waves of outside influence they started using quills and brushes, depending on the regions. Pencils, although practical, were introduced by a certain Nalaq spirit and Shira hadn’t heard anyone using it beside himself. The stick he used as a bribe was exactly a pencil. It sharpened many times and half-way on its way before he needed another one. Shira thought, maybe he should extort some more pencils for the next match from Good-Natured Spirit.</p>\n<p>Mila furrowed. She knew about the pencil and its value not too long ago thus, as expected, she grabbed it shamelessly. “What? Do you think you can escape only with this?”</p>\n<p>“I planned to give you something else but I think you’d rather like this simple bribe anyway.”</p>\n<p>Shira wanted to simply give her money to make her shut up. But the coins he had on him now only in form of foreign currency--the coins he extorted from Good-Natured Spirit from the last chess game. The boy frowned. Beside nagging him at full force, what did Mila coming here for?</p>\n<p>“Yeah, that reminds me, the news I wanted to tell you!” Mila finally snapped out of her nagging mode. “That Malikh girl! Your fiancée! After two years abroad! She’s finally coming home!”</p>\n<p>“Ohh…” the reply was anticlimactic.</p>\n<p>“Ohh? What the fuck with that reply?”</p>\n<p>“You don’t mind me. I just already burn out when people compare me with her,” Shira said. Although their age were the same, this young lady of Malikh Family was famous even in the nearby villages and town as a talent, with a promising look that might make her a beauty worth dying for. The old generations called her treasure and the boys loved her as the village princess. She went abroad two years ago for a series of seminars after an official from the capital scouted her talent. Now that she returned, everybody was fervently talking about her. But for Shira Yashura, the boy who was supposed to be the fiancé, even that kind of news wasn’t enough to make him get up from his comfortable napping.</p>\n<p>“My father wants to talk with you,” Mila said, “get up now.”</p>\n<p>“What about?”</p>\n<p>“You still asking?”</p>\n<p>The boy had a premonition that a troublesome matter would be waiting for him. Mila gave him an ultimatum before she wandered off to do her own things.</p>\n<p>“Hehe, what’s this fiancée I heard just now?” Good-Natured Spirit popped out his head from a tree beside Shira.</p>\n<p>“It’s not what you think,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“Oh yeah?” Good-Natured Spirit nudged the boy with his elbow. “I heard that chick is a hella beauty. Hehe, I bet her luggages is in good-quality, you know what I mean?”</p>\n<p>“From whom did you hear that?”</p>\n<p>“Doesn’t matter who. When it comes to chick my radar is very sensitive, eh. I’m curious. Did you benefit from this engagement thingy? Benefit, know what I mean?”</p>\n<p>Shira clicked his tongue. “Like I said, it’s not what you think it is. Our parents set us up and it’s been a mess since the talks about engagement got out.”</p>\n<p>Talking some sense to this good-for-nothing Nalaq was futile. Good-Natured Spirit kept teasing him. “You haven’t seen her for two years, have you? The talks I’ve been hearing down there real hairy, brat. I mean… especially those luggages of hers, know what I mean? Know what I mean? Nudge nudge. Nudge nudge,” he winked. “Wanna check on her?”</p>\n<p>“I need to go back. My uncle wants to talk with me.”</p>\n<p>“Alright then,” Good-Natured Spirit nodded as he rubbed his chin. “I’ll check the chick myself.”</p>\n<p>Carrying the canvas and the chess with him, Shira warned the Nalaq, “You better not do anything funny to her, hear me?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho. Jealous?”</p>\n<p>“I just don’t want their entire family coming right after me with pitchforks just because yo do something stupid.”</p>\n<p>After he said that Shira Yashura turned around. He started to walk down the hill. Good-Natured Spirit saw the boy walk without caring for the world, then he set off to check the girl by himself with a chuckle that escaped from his mouth.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A few hours later the said fiancée showed herself in a public training field. The field, owned by the most influential family in Badril Village--the Elzhier Family--was neatly arranged with archery targets and provided with dulled swords for the teenagers trained themselves or doing mock battles. The Elzhiers sent some menservants occasionally to act as security in case conflicts would occur. Today, the young master of the said family himself, nicknamed Bony, guarded the entrance along with two of his lackeys.</p>\n<p>“I’ve got to pay you to enter?!” a young man gawked at the sudden irregularity regarding the training field’s rules. “What’s this? The field is supposed to be free for everyone!”</p>\n<p>“Well, man, gotta pay for maintenance cost,” one of the lackeys, called Pilek, said as he rubbed his nose.</p>\n<p>“One silver kobe! Heh, maintenance cost my ass! Nobody would pay for this bullshit.”</p>\n<p>“Nobody? You wrong, man,” another lackey called Polio pointed at the crowd inside the training field with a gesture of his head. The girl from the Malikh Family causing a big ruckus from her arrival alone. She attracted boys like a bright lamp attracted fireflies. Because of that, the three deliquents in the entrance for nearly half an hour had been amassing quite a fortune till now.</p>\n<p>“I’ll definitely send complaints to Elzhier Family now. Just because your father is the village head you think you can do whatever you want, eh?” the young man snorted, sending a glare to them.</p>\n<p>The Elzhier Family’s young master, who had been watching with his back resting on the wall and his arms crossed, decided to open his mouth, he said, “Pay or get lost.”</p>\n<p>“Hear that? Boss Bony has spoken,” Pilek glared back at the young man with his head tilted. “Better get lost now or else…”</p>\n<p>“Or else!” Polio emphasized with a higher voice.</p>\n<p>The three of them had been infamous in the village despite being heirs to their respective families. Naturally, though they were the same age, only an idiot would butting head directly with the heir of Elzhier Family. Thus the young man snorted, unwillingly turned and walked away.</p>\n<p>“What the heck is that?” Pilek didn’t like the way that young man snorted at them. “We should teach bastards like him a few good lessons one of these days.”</p>\n<p>“You’re right,” Polio added.</p>\n<p>“Just ignore that bum,” Bony said.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, the next onlookers came. Not boys, but two girls to be exact. They carried bags of dirty clothes with them as they were on their way to wash the clothes at the river.</p>\n<p>“Well, I’d be damned,” one of the girls, a young lady named Romana, said, “I’ve been hearing about the rumors but looking at that Malikh girl, damn…. Look at how she did with her hair, Mila.”</p>\n<p>They could see what was happening in the field even from the entrance. The two girls looked at a certain girl who was surrounded by boys. The other girl, Mila Yashura, furrowed her brows at the current appearance of her cousin’s fiancée. She kept her mouth shut despite the anger on her eyes.</p>\n<p>“She cut her hair short despite being engaged to your cousin,” Romana said to Mila. “What’s that supposed to mean?”</p>\n<p>It was a custom of southern Mossack people for women to cut their hair short to tell the opposite sex they currently unavailable. Mostly widows who weren’t ready to be courted again chose to cut their hair that way. However, since the young lady of Malikh Family was currently engaged, the act of cutting her hair short was confusing to people.</p>\n<p>From the three delinquents who had been hearing their conversations, Pilek butted in, “Yo, ladies, don’t think too much about it. We southern people been foreigners with this fiancé-and-fiancée business. We practical people, y’know? Southerners the kind of people who would do it first then talking ‘bout marriage later. A chance she might not know what she was doing.”</p>\n<p>Romana rolled her eyes. Knowing Mila Yashura was here, she wished this stupid cheerful delinquent wouldn’t say what he had said. In fact, better for him to not open his mouth. She hated him whenever he opened his mouth and said pointless things.</p>\n<p>Her and Mila’s goal was to check about the rumor regarding the fiancée’s short hair. They didn’t have the intention to enter the training field and mingle with those crowdy horny boys, lest talking with these shameless thugs who clearly act as bandits.</p>\n<p>“Let’s go, Mila,” Romana whispered as she realized Mila had been glaring at the three delinquents. Moving her eyes from Mila, she looked at Bony who was in between his two lackeys. She whispered again, “you can’t fight him like you used to. He got a Knight class now. People said he can even fight another Knight with four level above him. Let’s just forget about it.”</p>\n<p>Last time Mila and Bony fought was three years ago. Her punch made his nose bleed but that was the end of it. It was a hot topic for a while and most didn’t know what happened but the long enmity between the two of them suddenly dropped cold and they had been avoiding each other. Seeing how the other party was quite well, Mila Yashura grimaced. They were Novices back then but now, after both of them ascended the first level barrier and got themselves class titles, there was no way a support-class Specialist like her could deliver that kind of punch again to his face.</p>\n<p>“Mm. Let’s go,” Mila said to Romana. No matter how brave and reckless she was, as a non-combatant talent, she knew better than to sow another discord with the village’s young generation’s strongest.</p>\n<p>Pilek, the most cheerful in Bony’s group, who was actually the most friendly, waved his hand to the girls as they walked away. Neither of them bothered with him.</p>\n<p>“Ahhh, my sister’s been avoiding me lately,” Pilek grumbled. Romana, Mila’s friend, was actually his half-sister from different mother. He was a proud big brother when they were young, until their mothers had a fight and his half-sister moved into a separate house.</p>\n<p>“Pilek,” Bony called.</p>\n<p>“Yes boss?”</p>\n<p>“You should’ve kept your mouth shut.”</p>\n<p>Pilek wryly smiled and nodded. Polio also thought his friend Pilek couldn’t read between the line. Although Pilek’s remark was well-intentioned, it’d just make things worse for Bony. The bad mood from back three years ago still left after taste that made him and her uncomfortable dealing with each other.</p>\n<p>After that, more people were coming to see the young lady of Malikh Family.</p>\n<p>The talks and speculations about her hair made the boys think she was dissatisfied with her engagement with Shira Yashura. Thus giving them hopes to snatch her away. It was no exaggeration to say that most of the boys fell for her, especially after they saw how the young lady grew beautifully. They surrounded this girl who had this icy expression on her face, though she herself greatly concentrated on holding a bow and an arrow, eyes straight to the archery target dozens of meters from her. She shot. And when the arrow hit splendidly, the boys would cheer and fawn all over her. The girl kept her face cold despite the flooding flattery coming at her way.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” a young man in his early twenty stepped forward from the bunch of admirers and confidently said, “I see you have this different aura about you. Something special that I can’t quite get my fingers on it, and I can’t help but feel curious about you.”</p>\n<p>That was supposed to be a pick-up line, but Bhela Malikh replied straightforwardly, “I changed. Now I’m Level 10 and not a Novice anymore.”</p>\n<p>“Oooohhhh!!” the crowd was surprised. Reaching the first barrier and got a class title at fifteen years old was the second time in these two decades. The first one was Bony. However, considering the girl was quite a talent enough for people in the capital to notice her, there was a high chance for her to snatch the crown as Badril Village’s young generation’s strongest from Bony sooner than everyone expected.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” the young man called for her attention again, despite his first attempt at hitting on her was an utter failure. “I see your beautiful sharp eyes and beautiful nimble hands and your beautiful pretty face. The class you’ve got must be… a beautiful <b>Archer</b>, right?”</p>\n<p>“I am an archer,” Bhela replied tight-lipped. Well, it was obvious when she picked a bow the first thing she arrived here.</p>\n<p>“Ah, a beautiful and talented Archer then! It’s a pity, though for such a fine beautiful flower like yourself to be thrown into a heap of cow dung…”</p>\n<p>The remark made Bhela Malikh raise her brows. She somehow could predict where the topic was going to be directed.</p>\n<p>“That stupid engagement is what I say! How could a diamond such as yourself be forced to marry a trash from Yashura Family?”</p>\n<p>He sighed like he pitied the harsh fate of the beauty. And though unlikeable as he was, the murmurs of the crowd seemingly agreed with him. At that point, someone said, “That’s true. Even my ten years old nephew is one Level above him. Such trash to become…”</p>\n<p>The words stopped, Bhela looked at the person who said that. “The one from Yashura Family--he’s still a Level 3 Novice?”</p>\n<p>It was someone else who replied to her question. “Ah, yes, he’s stuck and made no progress even since Young Lady Bhela went outside the village. Everyone calls him The Eternal Novice.”</p>\n<p>And this made her raised brows turned into a frown. Going by the crowd, for a Level 5 Novice by fifteen years old was already considered slow progress even by the standard of rural places like Badril Village. Mostly at that age the youngsters already reached Level 7, the diligent ones could reach Level 8 with hard work. Faster than that, not counting usage of an unreasonable amount of growth-hack potions--which most children from rich noble families did, could be considered a talent amongst the younger generation. However, to think of a boy one year before his own coming-of-age ceremony coming still stuck at such low-level talent, even though if he was the heir of Badril Village’s major families, people would still call him trash, even in public.</p>\n<p>“Ah, Young Lady Bhela! You don’t have to bother yourself with such eyesore trash. I know you’re troubled with the careless arrangement your father made, but if we put our mind to it, we can--”</p>\n<p>All was well until the young man put bad words about her father. Never did he expect that the girl would mercilessly retract her hand just before the tips of their fingers touched.</p>\n<p>“Please don’t pretend you were familiar with me,” that was what she said.</p>\n<p>The rain of snickers rang all around him. Despite him glaring left and right in an intimidating manner, there was no way for him to suppress the crowd from humiliating him further. At the time he realized the chance for him to court the Young Lady of Malikh Family, the sole daughter of the Malikh Family Patriarch, was pitifully close to nothing. Thus, in a moment of spontaneity, he thought of a scheme to save his face and sounded it with a flash of desperate smirk plastered on his face. He grabbed a bow and said, “I see Young Lady Bhela rather reserved toward us long friends after two years abroad. Hmm, yeah, this is a perfect chance, by the way. I’m an Archer too, see. So why not this senior teach you a thing or two? Seventy meters--perhaps a good learning experience for young lady, no?”</p>\n<p>The surrounding began chattering lively. It was obvious it was a challenge as Archers. And the young man’s smirk turned more and more confident at the girl’s unresponsiveness. No matter how much potential talent one had, time and experience playing a vital role in assessing one’s current performance whether she was Archer or Priest or Knight or other classes. Skills, abilities one acquired after reaching the first barrier and getting a new class title could only progress with constant tempering in battle and improved alongside one’s level. The young man was a Level 12 Archer. So theoretically, a Level 10 new Archer like Bhela Malikh would need a few more years before she could beat the opponent in a fair competition.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh was annoyed. She glared at the ones who were supposed to be guarding the field. But Bony and his lackeys were busy counting coins. For Bhela, the crowd were a bunch of stupid annoying busybodies who prevented her to train in peace. But for Bony and his lackeys the crowd was simply a bunch of gold mines.</p>\n<p>“Please watch closely how I do it, Young Lady Bhela. See my elbow? If you could do the same way I do it, I’m sure your archery skill would improve significantly.”</p>\n<p>No one really bothered with the ‘humble direction’ the young man spouted. Bhela didn’t spare him a glance. She looked straight to target seventy meters from where she was standing. Repressing his anger, the young man began to shoot three arrows one by one splendidly; the final one landed right in the center of the target that was marked in red dot.</p>\n<p>He was satisfied with the result. Glancing at the young lady, this young man wanted to utter more words to improve his image. However, right before he opened his mouth, he found Bhela already drew her arrow, released it, and it hit one arrow splendidly. Not just hitting the target, but an arrow the young man previously shot. The second was the same. And the final third arrow also hit the arrow on the red dot.</p>\n<p>What was that? She used a skill? The young man wanted to object but his tongue froze and his lips quivered. Did she use <b>Far Sight</b> skill that enhanced eye-sight a hundred of meters away? Did she use <b>Boost Accuracy</b>, the skill that was supposedly forbidden to be used in duel between Archers? To think of beating him, an Archer older than her and 2 Level right above her, in such a devastating manner… she must be cheating, right?</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” the defeated young man said weakly, “I didn’t use my mana between my shots.”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh nodded.</p>\n<p>“Neither was I.”</p>\n<p>With that, Bhela turned around and left the crowd of dumbfounded boys with steps full of grace. She approached the entrance, returned back the bow she used to the three delinquents who just let people mess with her training and said coldly, “If this is how the famous Young Master Elzhier manages his property, then there’s no need for me to come here again. Please excuse me.”</p>\n<p>Bony’s expression didn’t change much as he still crossed his arms and rested his back casually on the wall.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Pilek, the one received the returned bow from Bhela, waved his hand again and shouted, “Take care, princess!”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Because she couldn’t train her archery peacefully in public, Bhela returned back to Malikh Family and trained in her private training place.</p>\n<p>It was originally a backyard turned archery ground, made by Malikh Family Patriarch after knowing his daughter showed interest in archery. It was nothing fancy. It was spacious and good enough when she started with her first bow but now Bhela felt the place was lacking. At most, she had to live with the meager fifty meters range maximum. Therefore, the practice she had made a habit of had to wait.</p>\n<p>Therefore, Bhela Malikh decided to put her mind over something else than her usual practice instead.</p>\n<p>She drew a deep breath. A table was provided with dozens of arrows laid on top of it. Bhela picked four at the same time, nocked them on her bow string. She began to aim.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the air surrounding her changed. Her inexperience as a newly Novice-graduate showed by the obvious mana that leaked from the inside out. With naked eyes, her mana looked calm colorful haze that consisted of four bold colors, tangling and struggling with each other for dominance. Her eyelashes quivered. Channeling mana to cast a skill she yet had mastered felt like trying to stand on the raging sea waves while she herself was being a weak newborn.</p>\n<p><em>Whhhhuuuuushh--</em></p>\n<p><em>Shuuuhsh--</em></p>\n<p><em>Ssshhhuuuush--</em></p>\n<p><em>Wwhuuuussh!!</em></p>\n<p>The fastest arrow, coated with sparking yellow-colored mana, hit one of the targets at around forty meters range. But the others performed pitifully. The one infused with wet blue-colored mana didn’t even reach two-third of the desired range. The green-colored one, an arrow infused with mana that generated unstable wind trajectory flew far far away, as if it was getting swallowed by the sky, never to be seen again. The last one, the red-colored arrow, was horrifying. It hit the training ground fence instead the target. The bamboo fences suddenly set ablaze by raging flames as soon as the said arrow came into contact with them.</p>\n<p><em>Clap clap clap!</em></p>\n<p>Uninvited claps resounded across the training ground. On the wall Good-Natured Spirit clapping after watching a good spectacle. For getting hand claps from a Nalaq like him, naturally the level of talent Bhela showed just now was far beyond ordinary.</p>\n<p>“Thank you…” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>It appeared she knew beforehand the four-arrows skill she shot would make a mess. So she gathered the maidservants and made them extinguish the fences that started to burn into ashes. “Thank you, thank you for your hard work,” she said to a pair of maidservants who briskly went back and forth to kill the fire before its spread.</p>\n<p>“Ah! Young lady, what skill was that just now?” one of the maidservants gawked after the fire was extinguished.</p>\n<p>“That wasn’t just your ordinary Archer skill, was it?” added the other.</p>\n<p>Summoning a blazing fire just with an arrow and pure mana was unheard of. At least, the maidservants knew nobody in the village could do that.</p>\n<p>Bhela drank a glass of murky liquify herbs mixed with mint to cool down her manasphere. “It’s something I learned when I was away,” she said after putting down the glass on the tray her maid servants provided. She continued, “I still can’t master it, though.”</p>\n<p>She cast her eyes at the unharmed targets one by one. Shooting at forty meters range was still too much for her using four arrows at the same time. When the maidservants realized her difficulty, they encouraged her to simplify it and shoot one arrow at a time. However at their suggestion, Bhela shook her head. “It’s the requirement of this skill I’ve got to shoot four arrows,” she explained.</p>\n<p>The maidservants nodded at her words and apologized for their shallow suggestion.</p>\n<p>“Don’t mind that,” Bhela waved her hand. “There’s something I heard from people, by the way. Something about Young Master Yashura.”</p>\n<p>The two maidservants glanced at each other before one of them replied. “The rumor says… he holed up from the public’s view because he’s ashamed he can’t even become a Level 4 Novice.”</p>\n<p>“Are the Yashura Family elders still favoring him as the heir of Yashura Family Patriarch?”</p>\n<p>“We don’t know whether they still favor him or not. But Yashura Family always united in their standing. So unless the current Patriarch of Yashura Family has a son, the Young Master Shira Yashura will undoubtedly become the next patriarch.”</p>\n<p>“No rumors about the Yashura Family elders wavering then?”</p>\n<p>The maidservants shook their heads altogether.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela… apologize for giving you my shallow suggestion once again but…” one of the maidservants came near to Bhela and whispered, “With him as the heir, Yashura Family’s future will be bleak. Everyone in our family said your father’s bad condition is a bad omen for us mingling with those simple Yashuras. I’m very sorry if this sounds impudent--but you should’ve better cut ties with them before too late, young lady. Madam was too grieved by your father’s ill health to make decisions thus the only one who can save our Malikh Family is you.”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at the maidservant. The glint on her eyes changed.</p>\n<p>“There’s already a plan laid to help our Malikh Family,” that was all Bhela said. “You better not say something like that again. You lucky no one here beside me to hear you utter that kind of words.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you for your mercy, young lady! We are sorry for being impudent!”</p>\n<p>They decided to make it history with only the four of them who knew the previous conversation. The four of them; the young lady and two maid servants and one Nalaq spirit who came here uninvited.</p>\n<p>“It seems I just heard something I shouldn’t hear,” Good-Natured Spirit said while he rubbed his chin. He came here peeking. He didn’t have the intention to reveal himself while the girls below had a secret conversation ignorant of his presence.</p>\n<p>After that Bhela continued with light training. Good-Natured Spirit watched her doing simple shooting, she didn’t even use a slightest of her mana from then on. Yawning, Good-Natured Spirit stood up. Then he flew away from Malikh Family and began to look for some other interesting thing to sate his boredom.</p>\n<hr>\n<authors-note id=\"Radhy\">\n<p>Testing, testing.

Do you think I could get it back that easily?”</p>\n<p>“H-head maid…” Jane knew, although Butler Tim didn’t have enough influence to be a tyrant in Blackwood Family’s manor, still not someone Jane could afford to offend. Biting her bottom lip, she whispered, “Please, head maid… if I perished due to bad luck, how could my family pay their debts?”</p>\n<p>“Get up now. Didn’t you say you have a way to pay it without working here for a dozen years more?”</p>\n<p>“That was before,” Jane’s voice was hoarse, “I never would’ve thought that bastard only spout empty promises of taking care of my family and other bullshit.

Everybody’s ended up dead after they were sent to Young Lady’s place!”</p>\n<p>“Nonsense.

She immediately came to head maid as soon as she knew her old post being taken and didn’t have time to gossip with other maidservants. “Really, head maid, you know I just came back. Don’t talk in a roundabout way…”</p>\n<p>“Sir Arden is going to hire an expert to clear plague in our Young Lady’s mansion, he’s planning to do it in a month's time,” the head maid said. “You know Sir Arden’s reputation, and you know how reliable his words are. Go serve Young Lady there--by the time Sir Arden comes with the hired expert, he’ll be grateful for loyal servants who willing to accompany his niece in her difficult time!”</p>\n<p>Hearing the urge behind head maid’s tone, Jane choked by her own cry from earlier. Even Madam Blackwood had to be polite to this younger brother of hers--as the man’s reputation was the sole reason Madam could be so tyrannical on ruling the house. But even then Sir Arden was too lazy to pay attention to his sister and her be. Jane, a mere maidservant--could she really gain Sir Arden Blackwood’s favor?</p>\n<p>The head maid continued, “What are you hesitating for? Even Floria that girl who even prettier than you couldn’t even get Sir Arden to glance at her--do you think any girl can have the same chance as yours right now?” she paused, learning the contour of Jane’s expression before she said again, “even if you can’t be his mistress, Jane, I assure you that even Butler Tim won’t be able to touch your position if Sir Arden Blackwood has a good impression on you.”</p>\n<p>Jane lowered her head. Head maid was right. A chance to get on Sir Arden Blackwood’s good side wouldn’t come as easily as this.</p>\n<p>She calculated the weight and found that, since two of her friends were sent to serve Young Lady Blackwood six month ago and still survive, a good odd that Sir Arden Blackwood would rescue her before the disease from Young Lady’s cursed bad luck would take her life for good.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>There was no need for her to prepare anything.

This steward talked as if he was sincerely giving advice, yet for those in the main manor who didn’t know the rumors about their young lady?

Even though the expensive Ngajen Ceremony drew near a good number of ducks and a goat were butchered along with their spice reserves taken out. There were laughters, there lots of people wanted to get on the good side of the only Young Lady of Malikh Family.</p>\n<p>But Bhela’s face was straight the whole time. Given choices, she’d rather have a small dinner with her mother and sick father right now.</p>\n<p>“I heard you went to Elzhier’s training facility as soon as you arrived, young lady,” a bald elder said with big smile. “That is no good. You just return home after four days of traveling. You must have a good rest first.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you for your concern, Elder Jhamil.”</p>\n<p>Bhela had experience with people during her two years abroad to know the meaning of smiles like Elder Jhamil’s--the kind of smile that didn’t reach eyes, the fake kind of smile. She always found it was uncomfortable whenever she met with one. Yet what was more uncomfortable was the fact she was the star of the party. Flatteries and congratulations flowing in. Bhela kept nodding her head and had a smiling expression on her face. No one really had a good time beside the ignorant families who came to find abundant foods to eat.</p>\n<p>Finally toward the end of the big dinner Elder Jhamil gave a few speeches and led everyone for their patriarch's health. Bhela hadn’t come home for two years, but she was alert enough to know the popular opinion going around inside the Malikh Family. She knew her father was disliked by many because the engagement he set up more than a dozen years ago, back when she wasn’t even able to speak yet, back when the Malikhs didn’t think much of it and didn’t know the girl back then would grow splendidly into a fair Young Lady. What she didn’t expect was that, Elder Jhamil, would point it out in front of other family members.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady, I’m sure you’re aware about it by now, but the one from Yashura Family is still stuck on the same level from back when you were leaving for your seminars.”</p>\n<p>“I’m aware, yes,” she said. “And?”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil smiled dryly at the question, he said, “With a partner that lazy he’d drag you sooner or later, wouldn’t he? Especially with special talent as yours, many would have second thoughts. But then how about you? Are you fine with that, Young Lady?”</p>\n<p>Bhela didn’t immediately say what was on her mind. She quietly picked the warm ginger drink they served her, drank it, while her eyes glanced at a certain direction where two maidservants who immediately glanced down the moment her eyes came into contact with theirs.</p>\n<p>Seeing that Bhela wasn’t that responsive with the idea, Elder Jhamil spoke further, “Young Lady, don’t worry, we as Malikhs only worried about your future. If you feel injustice in your heart, you must be brave, you must voice it out to your parents, Young Lady Bhela--all of us Malikhs support you for whichever path you choose! Isn’t that right, everyone?”</p>\n<p>“That’s right!” someone shouted. Then came more rougher voice--</p>\n<p>“We don’t fear those Yashura’s retaliation, Young Lady. You don’t have to be afraid they’ll come here to bully us because of that trash from Yashura Family!”</p>\n<p>“We support you, Young Lady!”</p>\n<p>“Don’t be afraid!”</p>\n<p>The dry smile on Elder Jhamil turned elated when people were chanting along with his cue. It was only when Bhela slowly put down the warm glass of ginger drink in her hand did they stop making ruckus, everyone was waiting for what Bhela was going to say next.</p>\n<p>“I think,” Bhela said with the remarkable cold expression of hers, “any engagement in the main family should be the main family’s business only.”</p>\n<p>She stopped. Not a single more soul dared to send her further flatteries until dinner was over. Even the bald Elder Jhamil, the most enthusiastic of all them, quietly sat back where he belonged.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>“Ah, young lady, please wait, Young Lady Bhela!” the bald Elder Jhamil chased her, trotting, with a box in his hands.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh frowned upon hearing the voice. But she hid her expression well as turned around and asked, “Is something the matter, Elder Jhamil?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, in fact, there’s one matter a bit inappropriate to deal in the family hall,” as soon as Elder Jhamil said that, he opened the box he carried. It was a dress. “It’s something that I get from a merchant who has a lot of dealing with people in the west. He told me this is apparently the current popular fashion for western nobles. I think it’s good for Young Lady.”</p>\n<p>Bhela studied Elder Jhamil’s expression. If the dress truly was a fashionable goods then the elder ought to have paid a quite of coins to get this. As far as Bhela Malikh remembered, Elder Jhamil she knew wasn’t this kind even when her father the patriarch married. Naturally with such an expensive homecoming gift, Bhela was alerted.</p>\n<p>“Thank you for your kindness, Elder Jhamil. Bhela will treasure this well.”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, you don’t have to mention it, Young Lady Bhela,” Elder Jhamil said with a laugh. Then, while rubbing his palms unconsciously, the bald elder began to smile--not a fake one like he usually did have, a genuine smile, one that reflected his current emotion--the smile of greed. “By the way, young lady,” he continued, “I heard you getting along well with the Young Master from the noble Blackwood Family during your time away…”</p>\n<p>“Young Lady of Blackwood Family is my friend,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“Yeah but… I also heard in the next ngajen ceremony, Young Master Blackwood would grace us with his presence… is that true?”</p>\n<p>“I wouldn’t know.”</p>\n<p>“Hehe,” Elder Jhamil chuckled knowingly. “I think things would go well if you wear that dress during ngajen ceremony, young lady.”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh said a short and ambiguous reply and tried to get away from the bald elder. After she escaped in the lone corridor, she took out the dress from the box. The said dress was glimmering under the torchlight, yet, in spite of that, Bhela wasn’t happy the slightest bit.</p>\n<p>“This kind of thing…”</p>\n<p>A proper dress for ladies of southern people was hiding everything below the collarbone. Showing more, akin to invite men to do something indecent. Bhela wasn’t a conservative to follow Mossack customes down rigidly as shown from her cutting her hair short despite the gesture usually reserved for unavailable widows. But still, something like decency of girlhood, was something even someone duller than Bhela should have. Even daring courtesans would think twice to wear this kind of provocative dress to attend a festivity made by the Mossack majority.</p>\n<p>It was distasteful. Bhela didn’t want to think too much about it. After putting back the dress, Bhela walked again to the east wing of Malikh Family where her father was resting.</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim Malikh’s sick room once used as the family’s <b>Alchemist</b> workplace. It had long been vacant, thus usually used to care sick and injured people, as it had the most complete medicinal facility in the entire Malikh Family. Upon entering the room, Bhela found the thick pungent of herbs made her head light. And still she was amazed by how loyal her mother was to taking care of her father closely when servants would need to take a breather of fresh air ten minutes inside the sick room.</p>\n<p>“Father, mother, I’m back…. Did they send some food here?”</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh, the mother, was the one who replied to Bhela. “They did. Some people might forget about the patriarch’s little family but there are still good aunties working in the kitchen,” a middle-aged woman said with a hint of sadness, helplessness, and resentment.</p>\n<p>“Does mother want some hot tea? I’ll go fetch and say my thanks for those good aunties,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“You girl, sit down. You just returned today, now you want to run around doing errands?” Madam Malikh smiled weakly. “How’s the village, dear? Does it change from the way you remembered?”</p>\n<p>“Somes changed, others stay the same, mother,” Bhela said. She got to the table and put the box Elder Jhamil gifted, then took it off her mind. She then picked a random book from the shelves. “Can I stay here for a while?” she asked while showing the book to her mother, telling her the intention that she was going to read it there.</p>\n<p>The mother’s smile turned strained. At noon, she purposely told this daughter of hers to see around the village because she was afraid, if Bhela spent too much time in this room, she would feel uncomfortable by the thick medicinal smell and grow to hate the idea of staying. Even some maidservants a few years older than her were fidgeting and eyeing for the door every time they had duty to bring a meal here. Yet, looking from her daughter’s unflinching eyes, Madam Malikh was relented in the end.</p>\n<p>“Sit here,” the mother offered her chair for her daughter, while she sat down on the edge of her husband’s bed.</p>\n<p>Bhela’s moved with small, noiseless steps, trying not to wake up her father. But it was unfortunate that her father woke up nonetheless.</p>\n<p>“Le… letter…”</p>\n<p>The quivering voice escaped his cracking dry lips.</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh wanted to retort. Not the letter again. No matter how many times she read it aloud he still thirst for the letter as if it was the only salvation left for his life. Nonetheless, she surrendered and she picked a smooth, white paper made from wood--the kind which was expensive and usually used overseas--and began to read its content.</p>\n<p>“I understand your situation. But sending help from where I am takes a while. Ask Yulong’s help for now.”</p>\n<p>As if the letter was his assurance, Patriarch Ghalim Malikh closed his eyes again.</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at her mother who folded the recently opened letter, she asked. “Whose letter is that?”</p>\n<p>“Your great-grandmother who lived overseas,” her mother said.</p>\n<p>“I see.” Bhela wasn’t sure which relative her mother mentioned, but she decided to ask something else seeing her mother’s bad mood. “Why Great-grandmother mentioned something about Yulong? Isn’t Yulong the Yashura Family’s butler, mother?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know, I reckon she told us to rely on Yashura Family instead.”</p>\n<p>The strained smile on her mother’s face made Bhela realize that even her mother was reluctant when Yashura Family was mentioned. As a mother, she loved Bhela dearly, and was the one to believe in her daughter before everyone else. She believed in her daughter’s future. That was why she was first to oppose Bhela’s engagement when the sour rumors about the heir of the Yashura Family started. Never would she expect that her Malikh Family would be in dire straits so suddenly they needed Yashura Family’s help to get them out of this mess.</p>\n<p>“Have you sent someone to inform Yulong, mother?” Bhela asked.</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh shook her head. Bhela reckoned with Elder Jhamil gaining influence so fast, her mother wouldn’t know anyone to trust in this kind of situation.</p>\n<p>The girl then gave her mother a glass of water to ease her down. “I’ll let him know then,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Dear,” Madam Malikh brushed her daughter’s hair as she smiled helplessly, “showing your face in Yashura Family might complicate things…”</p>\n<p>Bhela patted her mother’s hands and assured her, “Don’t worry, mother,” she said, “I’ll ask favors from people I know from Elzhier Family.”</p>\n<p>Bhela thought her parents would go along with her arrangement. Madam Malikh hung open her lips as if she wanted to say something, but then she tightened her smile in the end. Unexpectedly, it was a weak voice that disagreed instead.</p>\n<p>“Bhela… don’t...” her father whispered weakly.</p>\n<p>“Dear?” mother leaned on toward his mouth.</p>\n<p>“What is it, father?” Bhela, too, leaned closer.</p>\n<p>“Don’t… ask… don’t… favor… purple...” the sickly patriarch’s voice turned hoarse and defragmented before he completed his sentences. Bhela and her mother quickly shushed him, they couldn’t afford to see the sick father forcing himself with this condition. Even after two minutes, he still struggled to tell his words to his daughter. Though eventually he fell to slumber by himself after his wife tried to put him to sleep with her eyes wet with tears.</p>\n<p>Beside her mother, Bhela picked a bamboo fan and used it to make a breeze for her father’s sleep to be more comfortable. Her expression was flat and straight the entire time, but inside, she was disturbed by the words her father failed to tell her.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>For as long as the Yashuras knew him, their Young Master Shira Yashura lived alone in his house. The only other person who should’ve been living here, his father, didn’t come home for months already. So ever since his uncle let him live in his house a few years back, Shira enjoyed an independent lifestyle he’d take for granted one of these days.</p>\n<p>At night, his schedule often filled with working on painting commissions Good-Natured Spirit gave him. Which, unfortunately, not something he wished for people to know. This part of his schedule was one of his secrets, if known by a certain meddlesome cousin, hell would surely be waiting for him.</p>\n<p>“I told you again and again,” a voice from behind him blurted, “you should’ve shown the boobs a little more.”</p>\n<p>Shira turned his head and groaned when he found the Nalaq’s annoying face a little bit too close. “Can you knock the door first?”</p>\n<p>“No way. I came through the wall. Door? What is door? Never use the thing since ages ago.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t creep up from behind, then. At least preserve your dignity as a Nalaq.”</p>\n<p>“I told you, don’t call me Nalaq,” Good-Natured Spirit hissed. “Anyway, boobs! The bweebs!! Make it more sexy! More bold and open!”</p>\n<p>“That’s not what we agreed on,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“Just a little, man. A little dot--tiny nipply dot--that’s all I’m asking for.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t push it, old man.”</p>\n<p>“Ah! You’re not fun anymore,” Good-Natured Spirit moaned in disatisfaction. In addition of Nalaq, Good-Natured Spirit was never fond of being called old. He died in his early thirty. So he retained the look, and he--according to himself--was still as handsome as ever. “Ah, forget it,” he waved his hand lazily. “Your drawings are second-rate porns anyway.”</p>\n<p>“You’re not paying for this one again?” Shira asked.</p>\n<p>“Not this one. Too safe. Don’t want it. At least make her boobs and butt bigger for the next time.”</p>\n<p>Shira sighed and wrapped it up for tonight. Everytime Good-Natured Spirit cancelled the commission's Shira wouldn’t have any choice but selling the paintings half-baked to a peddler he knew. Not even a half price, he’d be lucky if the rejected paintings would sell even one-fifth from Good-Natured Spirit’s usual payment.</p>\n<p>While Shira was tidying up his room, Good-Natured Spirit looked at the lady in the painting. The Nalaq said, “Hmm. I gotta say, man, despite your second-rate skill you’re natural when it comes to drawing faces. Especially the eyes. How should I say this… those aren’t the eyes of cheap bitches usually have, I tell you.”</p>\n<p>Shira didn’t know whether he should feel flattered or not. After he tidied the room and hid the naughty painting carefully, he prepared to go to sleep.</p>\n<p>“Oh, by the way,” Good-Natured Spirit said as Shira changed his shirt, “I’ve checked on your girl, brat. She’s a real good beauty, alright. Her talent too is not to be scoffed at. And also--boobs.”</p>\n<p>Shira glanced at him with tightened brows. “I’ll be troubled if they somehow trace it back to me in case the Young Lady of Malikh Family was assaulted.”</p>\n<p>“Hehe, relax man, I’ll never touch my buddy’s chick. We’re buddies, aren’t we?”</p>\n<p>Shira wanted to say no but he felt it’d be better for him not to comment on that. He then hurriedly kicked out the Nalaq so he could get some sleep in peace.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In almost all of Mossack race traditions, ngajen ceremony held monthly in villages near a mountain. It was one of those legacy of ancient Mossack that still around simply because of its practice brought safety to the people. Originally was a session of prayers and offerings to calm down Selaqs which dwelling on the mountains--they had to, because many stories being passed down in every families that even ancient tribe chieftains and heroes couldn’t do nothing if waves of Selaqs rampaged over the southern lands. Though, as the cost of ceremony getting more expensive as the time went on and getting more political, nowadays it became a time of feasts for big families to assert their surrounding influence. And a time of feasts where small and independent families gained side incomes from providing food and good for the big families’ feats. Ngajen ceremony was also the main reason why there was a weird rule for every Mossack-rooted families, tribes, and clans, that saying the leaders must be someone of a great cook--the majority of them were simply foodies.</p>\n<p>“And thus, Shira my boy--” the patriarch said as he played with his thick moustache, “--us southern people are naturally different from those imperialist western Haldeens and those warmongers feudalists of eastern Kaya. We don’t simply become leaders because of our noble bloodlines or merits and achievements in battle but simply because of food. This is an important lesson, my boy: no matter one hails from a noble blood or being a simple commoner, no matter one’s an enemy or ally, in the end, everyone’s going to eat happily and peacefully when we southern cooks shove foods up in their mouths. Remember that.”</p>\n<p>Shira Yashura quietly nodded. He didn’t plan to learn cooking from the start but, as the heir of Yashura Family, spending effort on foods probably one of the most important lessons before he became the next Patriarch of Yashura Family.</p>\n<p>“So you understand. Good. Sooner or later you’ll understand being strong is not everything, having talent is not everything,” the patriarch said. “Look at your father, for instance. He’s the only one in Badril Village who has an Unique class since… I don’t know, many many years. He’s pretty badass, eh? But why is that the one who ended up being the patriarch was me?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, Uncle Shuro, please do tell me.”</p>\n<p>Shuro Yashura, the patriarch uncle, smiled as he looked at his obedient nephew. He then half-bragging said, “Because he can only boil water, that’s why. Cooking is a great heritage of our ancestors thus those who have no talent on it as to be satisfied with being a second-rate Mossack. The only reason why people like me always ended up becoming the leader of clans because we Mossack appreciate food to a very high degree. Justice is food. Food is justice. With great cooking comes great responsibility.”</p>\n<p>But from the side a sour voice butted in, “Ohh. You’ll never know how much bullshit my father made up just now.”</p>\n<p>Uncle and nephew turned their heads to see a daughter pop her head from the window. Apparently, Mila Yashura had just returned from doing morning errands.</p>\n<p>“What are you guys doing anyway?” she asked. Apparently, in the kitchen, she saw her father and cousin shredding a ridiculous amount of coconuts. No one else was here in the kitchen, so Mila asked, “Did you two really do these by all yourselves?”</p>\n<p>“Of course,” her father, the revered patriarch, said as his hand vigorously shredded coconut. He couldn’t hide the annoying proud smile on his mustache filled face.</p>\n<p>“Since dawn?” Mila asked again suspiciously.</p>\n<p>“Food is justice. Justice is food. With great cooking comes great responsibility. Shredding coconut is one of the fundamental lessons for Shira to become a great patriarch in the future.”</p>\n<p>“Well,” Mila commented, “that’s dumb.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, girl! What do you know? You know nothing about the important philosophy behind every essence of coconuts,” Shuro Yashura exploded. “Since you a girl who don’t have to lead the family then probably you’ll never understand. You’ll never have to understand the hidden substance of every food you’ve eaten! Almost every Mossack delicacies made with coconuts. That Bulayak Satay sauce you like so much is made with coconut milk as a base! And don’t forget goat stew! And baked shredded coconuts cookies! And rendang! You name it. Coconuts have been granted us with delicious foods ever since ancestors were hunters-gatherers! Our very roots of being the descendants of ancient Mossack race can be traced as long as one ponder the mystery behind every shred of coconuts! Look at ancient empires! The ancient Aratararadararam Empire, for an instance, five thousands years ago, formed their empire solely by cultivating lots of coconut trees! They’re building civilizations relying only on the blessing of coconuts! That’s how great coconuts are! Only us who were born to lead our very empire can understand how miraculous are to be feeling joyous in pondering the great essence of shredded coconuts. You don’t know this much then you’re a dumb girl, eh. What a waste of a daughter you are!!” After taking a deep breath, Patriarch Shuro snorted at his impudent daughter, then glanced at Shira, smiling. “Isn’t that right, Shira my boy?”</p>\n<p>That was dumb. Even Shira knew that much. Because of that he kept his head hung low and focused on his task of shredding coconuts, pretending not to hear the question coming at him.</p>\n<p>“See?” the patriarch smirked. “He’s too absorbed by the grace of shredding coconuts he doesn’t notice my words.”</p>\n<p>Mila rolled her eyes, began to ignore her father. “Anyway, Shira! Have you heard the story about that girl Malikh beating up the best Archer kid single-handedly?”</p>\n<p>Shira of course knew about the archery duel that happened yesterday. Because Yashura Family and Malikh Family were entangled in a planned marriage, almost everyone in Yashura Family--including servants and clueless children--were talking about it. Yet he couldn’t raise his head and answer. Do that, and his uncle Shuro would know he only pretended to be interested in shredding coconuts. He’d only hurt his uncle’s feelings that way. Thus, in spite of Mila being overly loud today, all Shira needed to do was shredding and shredding and sometimes stopped to feel the shredded coconuts with his fingers, releasing a solemn sigh, as if he found something profound in every fiber of shredded coconuts.</p>\n<p>“That’s my boy, you understand all too well after all,” Shuro Yashura nodded in satisfaction. He was relieved his successor could be that enlightened by the grace of shredded coconuts. He then glared at his own blood daughter, who supposed to be the princess of the family, nagging so loudly that she stood in borderline of being a tomboy girl and a fussy aunty.</p>\n<p>“Oh, man, just leave him alone, would ya? Just think how many years for him to catch up with his girl--the more you hold him back the more people talk shit about him, father!”</p>\n<p>“Please dear! Is that how you talk with your father? I’m not holding him back, okay?” Patriarch Shuro Yashura then asked Shira, “do I hold you back, Shira my boy?”</p>\n<p>Shira further lowered his head and pretended not to hear that as if he was a turtle.</p>\n<p>“Better be careful. He’s too deep in coconuts he doesn’t even hear me,” the patriarch gave his daughter a glare.</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura rolled her eyes. She crouched and disappeared from the window view, then stood up again a moment later. Her hand clutching a pebble.</p>\n<p>The patriarch gawked, “Oi, what are you--”</p>\n<p>Mila aimed the pebble at Shira and it hit his head with an audible knock.</p>\n<p>“Thousands of gods!” Shira swore.</p>\n<p>“Too deep my ass,” Mila sneered. Unlike her father, she knew too well whenever Shira playing dumb.</p>\n<p>“What do you want?” Shira asked as he rubbed his head.</p>\n<p>“Let’s train your sword skill. You don’t want to face your fiancée with that crappy skill of yours, do you?”</p>\n<p>Shira glanced at his uncle unwillingly. “Do I have to meet with Bhela in her Family?”</p>\n<p>“That’s right, Shira my boy. You rarely visit other houses during ngajen ceremony but old folks from the Elder Council think this is a good time to show Malikh Family our good will,” Shuro Yashura said. “Remember to pray for their patriarch’s health too. He’s your father best friend, after all.”</p>\n<p>As if waiting for Patriarch Shuro’s completed his words, the door of the kitchen knocked at the very moment. A tall gray-haired old man entered. He had a posture that was straight and sharp, classy western-style butler uniform that hadn’t had looked worn out in spite no tailors around to know how to sew the said uniform, and his hand was balanced to hold a tray with a dozen elixirs on top of it with his left hand fingers, while his right hand rested on his back as if he followed an etiquette stranger to most of the villagers. He was the sole butler in Yashura Family--and perhaps, the only butler that ever employed in Badril VIllage.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira, this month’s elixirs your father sent for you have arrived,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Thank you, Yulong.”</p>\n<p>As usual, Shira drank elixirs his father sent abroad without a rest. The content was painfully bitter, thank goodness Yulong provided brown sugars for the boy to nibble after he drank those. His father Jhuro Yashura said--in a letter from abroad--that the elixirs were some kind of nutrient custom-made only for Shira, were expensive, so they could only afford them every one or two months.</p>\n<p>“How do you feel, Shira my boy?”</p>\n<p>Shira said as he munched a brown sugar to dismiss the bitter after taste. “Uh-hm. Better?”</p>\n<p>The family always thought they were a level-boost potion, Jhuro once sent a potion that could increase Shira’s level up to Level 3 in a single gulp after all. But the elixirs seemed to do nothing other than let Shira sleep comfortably at night. Still, his relatives, especially Mila, put their hopes on the resourceful Jhuro Yashura to nurture his own son--the heir of Yashura Family.</p>\n<p>Seeing the lack of enthusiasm in his nephew’s eyes, Patriarch Shuro laughed and said, “Haha. If those don’t work on your progress problems, don’t let it bother you! Your father worked very hard as an instructor in second-rank school and he’d definitely send a better elixir, like that one from three years ago!”</p>\n<p>“Oh,” Shira nodded. The elixir from three years ago was special. He knew it the moment he drank the potion. The warm feeling surrounding his manasphere was special, as with only drinking from one bottle, he leveled up 2 levels overnight.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>After that his uncle let him go out of the kitchen, since it was promised that Shira would do errands for his aunt every morning.</p>\n<p>When he was heading off for his duty, Shira Yashura got pranked by Good-Natured Spirit in the hallway, popped out his head from a wall and cried, “Boo!”--which Shira ignored because Yulong the butler was walking behind him.</p>\n<p>Yulong said with a polite baritone voice of his, “Young Master Shira, do you perhaps would visit the peddler today?”</p>\n<p>Shira looked at the butler. The matter about him doing business with a peddler wasn’t known to the family; but since Yulong wasn’t a Yashura and had been taking care of him since little, he eventually knew about the few investment deals that Shira never talked about. After collecting his thoughts, the boy replied to Yulong’s question, “Depends on the errand I receive, really. My aunt still hasn’t given my errands this morning,” the boy said.</p>\n<p>“I see, Patriarch Shuro took your time since early morning, so if madam doesn’t take pity for you then young master would finish today’s morning errands a little too late.”</p>\n<p>“The market would be too crowded if that happened,” Shira lamented. It couldn’t be helped. Boys and girls around ages of nine and sixteen--before they received coming-of-age ceremony--had to finish several trivial tasks each morning from both parents. It was a custom mainly to educate filial piety, though some smart parents and big family policies would give errands for the young’uns to make them do things that were beneficial for their futures, like street smarts and forming their own social circles outside the playmates they met everyday. Because his mother wasn’t here since he was a baby, and his father never came home for months, it was his aunt who always gave him errands.</p>\n<p>“Young Master,” Yulong stopped him again, “I’m glad for Young Master taking initiatives to improve your life. You grow too fast for this old butler to look after you. But as a child stepping into the adult world, please let me give you a small advice.”</p>\n<p>“I’m all ears, Yulong.”</p>\n<p>Yulong said, “You cannot guarantee everyone’s nature all around you, Young Master. Especially those who come approaching you with impure motives. I hope Young Master understands this, and to not make friends with nasty people.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit, who was around, snorted.</p>\n<p>Shira pretended he didn’t hear the Nalaq and nodded at the butler’s words. “You don’t have to worry about the peddler. Even though he’s been peddling for two years now, I found the fella got a pretty good sense.”</p>\n<p>“Hearing your words relieves me greatly. Thank you.”</p>\n<p>Afterward, Yulong excused himself as he needed to check the servants’ works for the arrangement of Ngajen Ceremony. The butler unassumingly walked on the side of the corridor, avoiding Good-Natured Spirit who was floating in the way, as if he knew there was something unpleasant floating in the way.</p>\n<p>“So long, fucker,” Good-Natured Spirit flashed his middle finger to Yulong’s back who just passed him by. Of course, the old butler didn’t show any reaction to his insult.</p>\n<p>“Why did you always do that to him?” Shira said to him with a frown.</p>\n<p>“This middle finger?” Good-Natured Spirit asked back.</p>\n<p>“No, the insult.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit grinned.</p>\n<p>“You know nothing about this middle finger, eh? Hehehh heh....”</p>\n<p>Yulong was someone Shira heartily respected. He always used polite language when talking to the butler. Because of that he was irked by the way Good-Natured Spirit sneered.</p>\n<p>“I need to sell the painting you rejected before the market becomes too crowdy. Let’s go,” he said. Bantering with Good-Natured Spirit would only make him more cocky, so Shira held the urge to humor his annoying behavior and headed off to the village’s market.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Back in the kitchen, Mila stayed with his father--who still shredding coconuts--while she read from a see-through board in front of her.</p>\n<p>“Ugh… his experience didn’t even change a single point,” Mila groaned.</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro too engrossed himself in coconut to realize what his daughter was doing just now. “You did a <b>Status Window</b> on him?”</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura nodded. Her face was sour though. “Look at this, old man. See what’s wrong with the number?”</p>\n<p>“Hah, his <b>Dodge Rating</b> getting crazier than before,” Shuro Yashura said with his fingers rubbing his moustache.</p>\n<p>“No! Look, father--his combat attributes, look closely! <b>Strength</b>, <b>Agility</b>, <b>Dexterity</b>! All of them pitifully underdeveloped. And look at the <b>Wisdom</b> attribute now!”</p>\n<p>“Ooh, his Wisdom’s pretty high. I knew his head’s pretty good. No wonder he could ponder the real meaning of shredded coconuts… he’s really a wise kid, after all.”</p>\n<p>“Please be serious, father. This is a serious matter.”</p>\n<p>“I’m serious,” Shuro the patriarch frowned. “And shredded coconut is a serious matter too!”</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura took a deep breath. Getting emotional over her father’s stupidity would only complicate the conversation.</p>\n<p>“Did you really hear the nickname they gave you...?” Mila asked him as she massaged her forehead. “It’s toothless Yashura. Toothless!”</p>\n<p>“Who said that?”</p>\n<p>“People.”</p>\n<p>“Fuck them people,” Shuro said. He never heard those old fogies calling him “toothless”, so he reckoned young'uns were the ones who came up with that. He sighed. For them to call this patriarch who always held the title of the best cook in Badril Village, those young people really didn’t have a good sense in them.</p>\n<p>“Because there’s Uncle Jhuro’s watching us from behind as a patriarch you can be toothless incompetent all you want, father, but--”</p>\n<p>“Oi, mind your words!”</p>\n<p>“--But!” Mila asserted despite her father started to pout after being called an incompetent, “but my generation is going to be harsh. No one as skilled and as strong as Uncle Jhuro appeared in the young’uns to be the guardian lion as our emblem is supposed to be.”</p>\n<p>“That is maybe but what are you trying to say here?”</p>\n<p>“What I’m saying is Shira can’t afford to be another toothless patriarch. You’re a support class, father, a <b>Specialist</b> like me. In our Badril Village history no matter how great your cooking is and no matter how wide our connections are if a conflict to arise a support class as a patriarch, nobody’d take us seriously--that is, unless another Unique Class who can afford to stay here in the village appears to scare them annoying people.”</p>\n<p>“Hoo, it seems you’ve been using your head a lot recently. That’s quite surprising.”</p>\n<p>Mila pursed her lips.</p>\n<p>“Unlike a certain carefree toothless patriarch, me and most family members concerned about Shira’s progress stuck as a Level 3 Novice. And what’s more, that girl Bhela Malikh--I don’t like what she did with her hair.”</p>\n<p>“Her hair?”</p>\n<p>“She cut her hair short. I confirmed it myself.”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro shook his head. He knew what his daughter was worrying about. “Girl, nephew Bhela has been away from the village and our dull way of thinking. She had been living with people in different cultures and customs these past two years. Maybe she cut her hair because she wants to follow fashion. Like that Aunty Yarly’s girl who suddenly has her lips red with lip balms, see? The young'uns are always doing it whenever foreigners come bringing their latest fads with them. You’re thinking too much.”</p>\n<p>“Why does everyone think Bhela Malikh is just some brainless girl who doesn’t know what she’s doing?” Mila Yashura frowned. “She’s smart, father. Even Shira knows she’s smart. You know what Shira said when I told him her fiancée has short hair now?--”</p>\n<p>She smirked.</p>\n<p>“--He said, ‘the engagement’s not going to work’.”</p>\n<p>“Bah! He’s been saying that shit for years!”</p>\n<p>“I know, I know!” Mila said. “But this time he’s serious. He said that with a punchable face as if he was saying ‘see, I told you’. His face looked punchable, I tell ya!”</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura was genuinely angry. This time, Patriarch Shuro Yashura didn’t immediately reply. He looked at his daughter, scratched his head, said, “So, in short, you worried about we can’t do nothing if Bhela is serious about cutting her hair to state her stance on her own engagement?”</p>\n<p>“Well, yeah! Of course I am. Only widows who cut hairs like that!”</p>\n<p>“You think it’s because she doesn’t like being paired with our Shira who is much weaker than her?”</p>\n<p>“Well, duh, old man, you’re still asking the obvious?”</p>\n<p>“Then don’t worry, look again at his status,” Shuro Yashura tossed back the status window back to his daughter. Its lifespan hasn't yet expired, so it was still showing Shira’s attributes and status as Level 3 Novice. “See what’s wrong in there?”</p>\n<p>Mila opened her mouth, “His combat attributes--”</p>\n<p>“No, look again!” Shuro cut off.</p>\n<p>Despite knitting her eyebrows, Mila still didn’t catch his father’s drift.</p>\n<p>Seeing his daughter had a hard time figuring it out, Shuro Yashura revealed, “His elemental affinity. See?”</p>\n<p>“It’s <b>Water</b> elemental affinity. It’s not that rare. What’s wrong with it?”</p>\n<p>“Well, he’s still a Novice. Getting a class still far away from him.”</p>\n<p>When a person reached the first barrier at Level 10 and got his class, there was a chance for him to aversed in one or more elementals and largely transformed, or perhaps even enhanced, the skills he would get from the class he acquired. Not everyone, but the chance was more than fifty-fifty. Aside from the rare ones, four base elementals that commonly appeared were <b>Fire</b>, <b>Wind</b>, <b>Lightning</b>, and <b>Water</b>--Mila wasn’t sure what so special for her cousin acquired an affinity over one of those base elementals.</p>\n<p>“Have you seen anyone with an elemental affinity in his Novice years?” her father asked.</p>\n<p>“It’s rare…” Mila was unsure, “can’t say I have.”</p>\n<p>“You haven’t. I have,” Shuro Yashura said. “Twenty seven years ago. Your Uncle Jhuro had a huge fight with grandfather and he ran away into the Mossy Forest behind the mountain--for nearly three weeks. He ate wild fruits. He ate monster meat also. But in the last three days he got unlucky and got poisoned by a snake monster ten levels above him. He struggled with death. Alone in that forest. But he lived. The fool then decided the forest was too dangerous for him and he returned back home.”--and got to experience a near-death situation again after their furious father almost pummeled him to pulp, Patriarch Shuro’s memories drifted.</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura listened. She knew the story of how his uncle survived alone in Mossy Forest--it was crazy, a kind of legend for the young’uns today. That was the first story amongst stories about the Badril Village’s last Unique Class warrior--Jhuro Yashura the Blackfang Swordsman--the story that first made him famous in the village for his unordinary bravery and recklessness.</p>\n<p>Shuro Yashura asked her daughter, “You know what happened after that, right?”</p>\n<p>She nodded.</p>\n<p>“Uncle awakened his rare <b>Poison</b> elemental affinity.”</p>\n<p>And Jhuro Yashura wasn’t even reached Level 10 back then.</p>\n<p>There was an unspoken law of the system most people didn’t know. A premonition, or sign, more appropriately, that if a Novice got an elemental before acquiring a class, chance was, an Unique class would be waiting for him.</p>\n<p>“See what I’m getting at?” Shuro Yashura said with a smile. “Time will reveal it, you don’t have to worry. Sooner or later, there’ll be another Unique class in our Yashura Family.”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>That morning the family getting busy preparing for ngajen ceremony; family officials, the servants, even brats too, were busy with their own errands. Usually with a few of copper kobe coins older kids could secretly pass their morning errands to the little ones--as lazier and richer kids like Shira wasn’t foreign to the practice, but unfortunately he couldn’t find some kids to bribe even on days like this. Not that he wasn’t happy about it. The errand his aunt gave him accidentally had something to do in the market, the destination he’d go to sell his painting today anyway.</p>\n<p>“Is it me or someone’s been staring at me since I stepped out of my family’s gate?”</p>\n<p>“It’s not you,” Good-Natured Spirit replied to Shira's question. “It seems the stalker Big-Boobed Sect sent today was particularly sloopy, kinda annoying.”</p>\n<p>“Oh yeah? How many of them are following me?” Shira asked half-heartedly.</p>\n<p>“What? You don’t believe them Big-Boobed Sect always spying on us?”</p>\n<p>Shira shrugged. Good-Natured Spirit was right--the boy didn’t believe his ramblings about all-girl sect always hiding in Badril Village’s shadows, especially with those padded words about them being beautiful and having bountiful bodies. He didn’t believe it because he still got some common sense. Not to mention hidden sects, even some decent clans and schools wouldn’t bother with ordinary places like Badril Village.</p>\n<p>And thus as he had feared, the market was already crowded by then. The moment Shira realized it, Good-Natured Spirit already drifted away by the sight of excitement in gambling dens and beautiful young wives from Elzhier Family sold street foods. As it turned out, it was stamped on the Nalaq’s mind to get off Shira as soon as they came to the market lest the boy’d use him for errands one way or another. The peddler Shira acquainted with was getting a good crowd as he laid his wares behind his wagon.</p>\n<p>“Monkey!”</p>\n<p>The peddler behind the wares turned his head. He had a funny face, a rare trait that made him resemble a monkey. And there was no coincidence everyone called him Monkey. When Monkey slightly wandered his eyes through the crowd and saw Shira, he waved his hands to the grunting customers and told them he’d close his shop for a while.</p>\n<p>“Well, well, isn’t this our Young Master Shira blessing us with his presence?” the smiling Monkey briskly approached as he rubbed his palms excitedly. “Can I help you young master?”</p>\n<p>Shira stepped back when Monkey got too close. “Monkey, you better stop being creepy whenever I come visit you.”</p>\n<p>“You hurt me, young master. There’s nothing creepy about our business relationship.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, it’s your face. Don’t make me regret selling my painting to you.”</p>\n<p>“Haha, surely you jest, Young Master Shira--I’m trying my best to maintain a professional face from now on!” Monkey said that then immediately took a small peek at the content. “Your skill is just getting better and better, master. I’m sure this will sell well, Master!”</p>\n<p>“What’s with the master thing?”</p>\n<p>“How dare for me to call you ‘Young Master’ while you yourself are already an expert at this stage?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t want our relationship getting creepier than it already is,” Shira said, then he took out a pouch of coins. “Anyways, I got an errand from my aunt, so give me the thirteen dried spices worth all this money.”</p>\n<p>“What kind of spice?”</p>\n<p>“All kinds of spices.”</p>\n<p>“Of course, of course, I’ll give you a discount, just to celebrate your improvement in the path of drawing, Master.”</p>\n<p>By the time Shira got himself a basketful of spices, Monkey’s grin getting more annoying. The stereotypical fat and slimy merchants looked innocent compared to him. After Shira threw a frowning glance at him, he <em>reluctantly</em> admitted, “Young master may not know this, but recently I’ve got an Alchemist partner with me who was trying to be independent from his family,” he said. “And I must tell you, young master, this family is a many-hundreds of years Alchemists family, and you also must know he’s not kicked out of incompetente--”</p>\n<p>Shira cut his roundabout pitching. “You want me to back the Alchemist?”</p>\n<p>“Mmm...yes….” Monkey nodded with a wry smile.</p>\n<p>The boy’s eyes wandered through the peddler’s wares before looked at him in the eyes. “Even I must tread through the game of cat and dog with the elders because of the rules,” he explained to Monkey, who in turn, could only smile helplessly.</p>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>Mossack’s custom dictates children who haven’t gone through their coming of age ceremony--usually at the age of sixteen--to not being involved in politics and commerce. This is the reason why Shira--as he mostly acquired money winning through streaks of chess games with Good-Natured Spirit--couldn’t recklessly flaunt his personal wealth in public.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>The risk of having a relationship gone sour with this young master, Monkey knew that. It was unlikely for an upstart peddler to be relied on by a future patriarch of a big family, and he wholeheartedly believed it was unwise to create a trivial misunderstanding with Young Master Shira Yashura. After all, it was only one year until Shira would have his own coming of age ceremony. Therefore, Monkey didn’t want to impose on the Young Master’s kindness too much and quickly changed the topic with something he’d prepared beforehand.</p>\n<p>“This is a <b>Boost Elixir</b> concocted by my partner. He might not a 2nd-Tier Alchemist yet but I assure you, Young Master Shira, the elixir’s potent power won’t lose against any experts you’ll find anywhere!” Monkey said with his over-excited sales pitch, which made him look more funny than usual, “This humble bottle was scientifically proven to increase a person’s level as long as he is below the age of twenty! To date, this Boost Elixir has 100% effectiveness in increasing the user’s level! Young master, you are very lucky--you can have this miraculous elixir just for half of the original price today!”</p>\n<p>Though it was clear Monkey meant no harm, Shira narrowed his eyes at the pedder.</p>\n<p>“Did someone pay you to make me drink it?” he asked suspiciously.</p>\n<p>“You jest again, Young Master… ha ha… haaa….” Monkey awkwardly laughed as he tried to hide his dampened enthusiasm. “Why don’t you try it first, Young Master Shira. You don’t have to pay if you didn’t get to graduate from Level 3 Novice.”</p>\n<p>Eventually, Shira drank the Boost Elixir within a gulp, not because he believed its miraculous effect, but because he was weak for free and discounted goods.</p>\n<p>“Your EXP bar didn’t even budge a little,” Monkey muttered with a meek voice.</p>\n<p>“The liquid is surprisingly well made though. Is this really made by someone you know?”</p>\n<p>“I said before, Young Master. The one who made this hailed from an old Alchemist family that even outside South Tiramikal Kingdom their last name still can be a pretty big deal. I’m pretty confident that--normally--this elixir will have a 100% success rate for leveling up whoever drinks it!”</p>\n<p>“Such a confident boast. Are you perhaps implying that my case is not <em>normally</em>?”</p>\n<p>“He hehe, you surely joke. You know that I don’t mean any harm, young master.”</p>\n<p>Shira of course knew it. And the other thing he also knew, that if it was a really impressive elixir he just drank by now, the usual Monkey wouldn’t utter a single phrase of the word “free”, regardless how many times the elixir failed to deliver its promise.</p>\n<p>Shira looked at Monkey suspiciously, “You’re Monkey, aren’t you? Not someone brainwashed by my family’s enemy or something like that? You know, by vampires.”</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira… now your joke is not even funny--something like a poor peddler to be brainwashed only appears in stories. Vampires are some unfounded folklore.”</p>\n<p>“Monkey I know is stupid. If not brainwashed, then he definitely manipulated to sell a fake elixir to someone from big families.”</p>\n<p>Before Monkey was able to retort that, a cold voice came from the wagon. “Young Master Yashura, I don’t mind if you pinpoint Monkey’s stupidity and make assumptions about him muchever you want. But to call my elixir is fake, I can’t stand and watch around anymore.”</p>\n<p>A man appeared from the wagon Monkey had, had an appearance of the stereotypical scholar Shira had in mind--though, by the way he crossed his arms pompously, he seemed to have a pride worthy of someone hailed from big families.</p>\n<p>“You’re the Alchemist?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, you call me Snake--don’t ask for my real name,” the Alchemist said.</p>\n<p>One would hide his name if he didn’t want to be associated with his family anymore. So Shira didn’t ask. He looked at the scholarly Alchemist, then at the peddler. One was the Snake and the other one was the Monkey.</p>\n<p>Shira found some sort of strange camradice between them. “I see, so both of you decided to be a partner for life.”</p>\n<p>“Not for life, no. Spare me. It’s better for me to ditch this stupid ape as soon as he outlives his usefulness.”</p>\n<p>“Heey! Don’t say ditching in front of me!” Monkey protested. Snake ignored him without pretense, making the impression that this scene was ordinary for them.</p>\n<p>Shira then asked Snake straightforwardly.</p>\n<p>“What kind of elixir is this?”</p>\n<p>“Didn’t Monkey tell you? A Boost Elixir. My latest masterpiece,” Snake replied.</p>\n<p>“You’re aware that your partner tried to sell your masterpiece at a half price, right? I don’t even have to pay, it was what he said before.”</p>\n<p>“It was my idea,” Snake said. “This is a simple business hack. I’m confident about my concoctions. After all, I experimented heavily on human anatomy--too heavy, even, to the point folks in my family want me gone for good. I’ve got nothing to lose here. That bottle is a prototype; it cost a lot so I planned to price it a lot.”</p>\n<p>“You want to use my bad reputation as a stepping stone, don’t you?” Shira asked with a sour smile.</p>\n<p>“Yes. Do you mind?”</p>\n<p>“No, I’d gladly make profit out of those trash talking they did behind my back--though, it seems you picked the wrong guinea pig to be your mascot for your ‘business hack’,” Shira said with a wry smile.</p>\n<p>Monkey nodded weakly. As a peddler from outside the village, he was always bothered by how nasty rumors could be, especially with some acquaintance he depended on sometimes as an important business partner.</p>\n<p>Seeing that they no longer had things to chat about, Shira said to them he’d consider putting some resources if he managed to gain some nod from the family elders after he went through the coming-of-age ceremony next year. And now that he finished selling Good-Natured Spirit’s rejected commision and completed the errand his aunt gave him, Shira then bid farewell to the two animal-nicknamed gentlemen.</p>\n<p>“Please wait, Young Master Shira.”</p>\n<p>Shira turned back his head again and found Snake, the one who called him, ran back to Monkey’s wagon to grab something.</p>\n<p>“Try to drink this one,” Snake said after trotting back hurriedly. “It’s alright, you don’t have to pay for this time too.”</p>\n<p>The current elixir Snake took out was the exact opposite from the previous one. Its container was beautiful and high-class, but the content was muddy and very low in quality. Hearing that this one was also free, Shira didn’t hesitate to drink it.</p>\n<p>The after taste was incredibly sour. Unlike any other bitter concocted elixirs or potions he ever drank. Although not much, Shira could feel his body warming up. He was surprised at the unexpected reaction.</p>\n<p>“Oohhhh!!!” Monkey cried as his eyes glued at Shira’s Status Window. “The EXP bar moved!”</p>\n<p>“What?” the surprised Shira glanced at Snake and asked slowly, “This one’s free, right?”</p>\n<p>It was in a single flash Shira did catch a strange dumbfoundedness in Snake eyes, like the result even came more shocking than him than either of Shira and Monkey. Yet the moment after he promptly regained his stoic exposure, then said to Shira, “Don’t worry, I don’t plan to take back my words,”</p>\n<p>The odd Alchemist put his hands at his back and walked back to his wagon. Before he climbed the wagon, he once again glanced at Shira, looking in a state of half-disbelief like expression</p>\n<p>As Snake disappeared into the wagon, Shira and Monkey exchanged glances.</p>\n<p>“He still has that kind of face even though he promises it to be free? You sure do have an odd friend.” Shira said.</p>\n<p>Monkey grinned. “Though an oddball, I never seen anyone with more talent in alchemy than him, like, ever.”</p>\n<p>After leaving Monkey to continue his stall, Shira saw Good-Natured Spirit again when he visited a food stall not far from Monkey’s wagon. He asked what he was doing, and the Nalaq told him there was a fool who bet a lot and won a lot in the gambling games. To lose against in gambling against someone with Good-Natured Spirit’s caliber, really--Shira sighed--he couldn’t wait for his coming-of-age ceremony next year so he too could farm on these gullible people in some friendly matches--just like what he did with Good-Natured Spirit for this past one year.</p>\n<p>“You know,” munching on some satays he bought from the market, Shira muttered when he headed home along with Good-Natured Spirit, “just then I drank this elixir that really could boost my EXP a little. I don’t know how the guy concocts it, but I have the feeling that I just drink some very expensive elixir for free.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, yeah?”</p>\n<p>On the way back to Yashura Family Shira told the Nalaq spirit about the Alchemist and his elixirs. He also told him that his status that usually wouldn’t react to normal elixirs this time moved a bit after he drank a strange low-quality elixir.</p>\n<p>“That Alchemist must be a nerd to be that sharp,” Good-Natured Spirit said as he floated lazily beside the boy.</p>\n<p>“He looks like that too. The peddler he partnered with also has some good sense in him. So I thought it’s not a loss for me to use all those foreign coins I got from you to invest on them for the next year.”</p>\n<p>“Hmm,” Good-Natured Spirit crossed his arms. “I think you should be worried.”</p>\n<p>“Worried? Why?”</p>\n<p>“You said that nerd Alchemist was the one who pushed that low-quality elixir to you, right?”</p>\n<p>“I got to drink that for free,” Shira emphasized.</p>\n<p>“He realized one little secret about you then,” Good-Natured Spirit said.</p>\n<p>Shira stopped walking. He looked at him with his head tilted.</p>\n<p>“What secret?”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit who floated before, spoke again.</p>\n<p>“You shouldn’t worry about it too much for now, brat. But, I advise you, if you are still holding dear for your lazy, peaceful village life, you should turn back and kill him right now.”</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-6/chapter-2":"<p>Dinner at Malikh Family; the family hall bustling with relatives who wanted to celebrate Bhela Malikh’s return. Even though the expensive Ngajen Ceremony drew near a good number of ducks and a goat were butchered along with their spice reserves taken out. There were laughters, there lots of people wanted to get on the good side of the only Young Lady of Malikh Family.</p>\n<p>But Bhela’s face was straight the whole time. Given choices, she’d rather have a small dinner with her mother and sick father right now.</p>\n<p>“I heard you went to Elzhier’s training facility as soon as you arrived, young lady,” a bald elder said with big smile. “That is no good. You just return home after four days of traveling. You must have a good rest first.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you for your concern, Elder Jhamil.”</p>\n<p>Bhela had experience with people during her two years abroad to know the meaning of smiles like Elder Jhamil’s--the kind of smile that didn’t reach eyes, the fake kind of smile. She always found it was uncomfortable whenever she met with one. Yet what was more uncomfortable was the fact she was the star of the party. Flatteries and congratulations flowing in. Bhela kept nodding her head and had a smiling expression on her face. No one really had a good time beside the ignorant families who came to find abundant foods to eat.</p>\n<p>Finally toward the end of the big dinner Elder Jhamil gave a few speeches and led everyone for their patriarch's health. Bhela hadn’t come home for two years, but she was alert enough to know the popular opinion going around inside the Malikh Family. She knew her father was disliked by many because the engagement he set up more than a dozen years ago, back when she wasn’t even able to speak yet, back when the Malikhs didn’t think much of it and didn’t know the girl back then would grow splendidly into a fair Young Lady. What she didn’t expect was that, Elder Jhamil, would point it out in front of other family members.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady, I’m sure you’re aware about it by now, but the one from Yashura Family is still stuck on the same level from back when you were leaving for your seminars.”</p>\n<p>“I’m aware, yes,” she said. “And?”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil smiled dryly at the question, he said, “With a partner that lazy he’d drag you sooner or later, wouldn’t he? Especially with special talent as yours, many would have second thoughts. But then how about you? Are you fine with that, Young Lady?”</p>\n<p>Bhela didn’t immediately say what was on her mind. She quietly picked the warm ginger drink they served her, drank it, while her eyes glanced at a certain direction where two maidservants who immediately glanced down the moment her eyes came into contact with theirs.</p>\n<p>Seeing that Bhela wasn’t that responsive with the idea, Elder Jhamil spoke further, “Young Lady, don’t worry, we as Malikhs only worried about your future. If you feel injustice in your heart, you must be brave, you must voice it out to your parents, Young Lady Bhela--all of us Malikhs support you for whichever path you choose! Isn’t that right, everyone?”</p>\n<p>“That’s right!” someone shouted. Then came more rougher voice--</p>\n<p>“We don’t fear those Yashura’s retaliation, Young Lady. You don’t have to be afraid they’ll come here to bully us because of that trash from Yashura Family!”</p>\n<p>“We support you, Young Lady!”</p>\n<p>“Don’t be afraid!”</p>\n<p>The dry smile on Elder Jhamil turned elated when people were chanting along with his cue. It was only when Bhela slowly put down the warm glass of ginger drink in her hand did they stop making ruckus, everyone was waiting for what Bhela was going to say next.</p>\n<p>“I think,” Bhela said with the remarkable cold expression of hers, “any engagement in the main family should be the main family’s business only.”</p>\n<p>She stopped. Not a single more soul dared to send her further flatteries until dinner was over. Even the bald Elder Jhamil, the most enthusiastic of all them, quietly sat back where he belonged.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>“Ah, young lady, please wait, Young Lady Bhela!” the bald Elder Jhamil chased her, trotting, with a box in his hands.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh frowned upon hearing the voice. But she hid her expression well as turned around and asked, “Is something the matter, Elder Jhamil?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, in fact, there’s one matter a bit inappropriate to deal in the family hall,” as soon as Elder Jhamil said that, he opened the box he carried. It was a dress. “It’s something that I get from a merchant who has a lot of dealing with people in the west. He told me this is apparently the current popular fashion for western nobles. I think it’s good for Young Lady.”</p>\n<p>Bhela studied Elder Jhamil’s expression. If the dress truly was a fashionable goods then the elder ought to have paid a quite of coins to get this. As far as Bhela Malikh remembered, Elder Jhamil she knew wasn’t this kind even when her father the patriarch married. Naturally with such an expensive homecoming gift, Bhela was alerted.</p>\n<p>“Thank you for your kindness, Elder Jhamil. Bhela will treasure this well.”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, you don’t have to mention it, Young Lady Bhela,” Elder Jhamil said with a laugh. Then, while rubbing his palms unconsciously, the bald elder began to smile--not a fake one like he usually did have, a genuine smile, one that reflected his current emotion--the smile of greed. “By the way, young lady,” he continued, “I heard you getting along well with the Young Master from the noble Blackwood Family during your time away…”</p>\n<p>“Young Lady of Blackwood Family is my friend,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“Yeah but… I also heard in the next ngajen ceremony, Young Master Blackwood would grace us with his presence… is that true?”</p>\n<p>“I wouldn’t know.”</p>\n<p>“Hehe,” Elder Jhamil chuckled knowingly. “I think things would go well if you wear that dress during ngajen ceremony, young lady.”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh said a short and ambiguous reply and tried to get away from the bald elder. After she escaped in the lone corridor, she took out the dress from the box. The said dress was glimmering under the torchlight, yet, in spite of that, Bhela wasn’t happy the slightest bit.</p>\n<p>“This kind of thing…”</p>\n<p>A proper dress for ladies of southern people was hiding everything below the collarbone. Showing more, akin to invite men to do something indecent. Bhela wasn’t a conservative to follow Mossack customes down rigidly as shown from her cutting her hair short despite the gesture usually reserved for unavailable widows. But still, something like decency of girlhood, was something even someone duller than Bhela should have. Even daring courtesans would think twice to wear this kind of provocative dress to attend a festivity made by the Mossack majority.</p>\n<p>It was distasteful. Bhela didn’t want to think too much about it. After putting back the dress, Bhela walked again to the east wing of Malikh Family where her father was resting.</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim Malikh’s sick room once used as the family’s <b>Alchemist</b> workplace. It had long been vacant, thus usually used to care sick and injured people, as it had the most complete medicinal facility in the entire Malikh Family. Upon entering the room, Bhela found the thick pungent of herbs made her head light. And still she was amazed by how loyal her mother was to taking care of her father closely when servants would need to take a breather of fresh air ten minutes inside the sick room.</p>\n<p>“Father, mother, I’m back…. Did they send some food here?”</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh, the mother, was the one who replied to Bhela. “They did. Some people might forget about the patriarch’s little family but there are still good aunties working in the kitchen,” a middle-aged woman said with a hint of sadness, helplessness, and resentment.</p>\n<p>“Does mother want some hot tea? I’ll go fetch and say my thanks for those good aunties,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“You girl, sit down. You just returned today, now you want to run around doing errands?” Madam Malikh smiled weakly. “How’s the village, dear? Does it change from the way you remembered?”</p>\n<p>“Somes changed, others stay the same, mother,” Bhela said. She got to the table and put the box Elder Jhamil gifted, then took it off her mind. She then picked a random book from the shelves. “Can I stay here for a while?” she asked while showing the book to her mother, telling her the intention that she was going to read it there.</p>\n<p>The mother’s smile turned strained. At noon, she purposely told this daughter of hers to see around the village because she was afraid, if Bhela spent too much time in this room, she would feel uncomfortable by the thick medicinal smell and grow to hate the idea of staying. Even some maidservants a few years older than her were fidgeting and eyeing for the door every time they had duty to bring a meal here. Yet, looking from her daughter’s unflinching eyes, Madam Malikh was relented in the end.</p>\n<p>“Sit here,” the mother offered her chair for her daughter, while she sat down on the edge of her husband’s bed.</p>\n<p>Bhela’s moved with small, noiseless steps, trying not to wake up her father. But it was unfortunate that her father woke up nonetheless.</p>\n<p>“Le… letter…”</p>\n<p>The quivering voice escaped his cracking dry lips.</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh wanted to retort. Not the letter again. No matter how many times she read it aloud he still thirst for the letter as if it was the only salvation left for his life. Nonetheless, she surrendered and she picked a smooth, white paper made from wood--the kind which was expensive and usually used overseas--and began to read its content.</p>\n<p>“I understand your situation. But sending help from where I am takes a while. Ask Yulong’s help for now.”</p>\n<p>As if the letter was his assurance, Patriarch Ghalim Malikh closed his eyes again.</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at her mother who folded the recently opened letter, she asked. “Whose letter is that?”</p>\n<p>“Your great-grandmother who lived overseas,” her mother said.</p>\n<p>“I see.” Bhela wasn’t sure which relative her mother mentioned, but she decided to ask something else seeing her mother’s bad mood. “Why Great-grandmother mentioned something about Yulong? Isn’t Yulong the Yashura Family’s butler, mother?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t know, I reckon she told us to rely on Yashura Family instead.”</p>\n<p>The strained smile on her mother’s face made Bhela realize that even her mother was reluctant when Yashura Family was mentioned. As a mother, she loved Bhela dearly, and was the one to believe in her daughter before everyone else. She believed in her daughter’s future. That was why she was first to oppose Bhela’s engagement when the sour rumors about the heir of the Yashura Family started. Never would she expect that her Malikh Family would be in dire straits so suddenly they needed Yashura Family’s help to get them out of this mess.</p>\n<p>“Have you sent someone to inform Yulong, mother?” Bhela asked.</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh shook her head. Bhela reckoned with Elder Jhamil gaining influence so fast, her mother wouldn’t know anyone to trust in this kind of situation.</p>\n<p>The girl then gave her mother a glass of water to ease her down. “I’ll let him know then,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Dear,” Madam Malikh brushed her daughter’s hair as she smiled helplessly, “showing your face in Yashura Family might complicate things…”</p>\n<p>Bhela patted her mother’s hands and assured her, “Don’t worry, mother,” she said, “I’ll ask favors from people I know from Elzhier Family.”</p>\n<p>Bhela thought her parents would go along with her arrangement. Madam Malikh hung open her lips as if she wanted to say something, but then she tightened her smile in the end. Unexpectedly, it was a weak voice that disagreed instead.</p>\n<p>“Bhela… don’t...” her father whispered weakly.</p>\n<p>“Dear?” mother leaned on toward his mouth.</p>\n<p>“What is it, father?” Bhela, too, leaned closer.</p>\n<p>“Don’t… ask… don’t… favor… purple...” the sickly patriarch’s voice turned hoarse and defragmented before he completed his sentences. Bhela and her mother quickly shushed him, they couldn’t afford to see the sick father forcing himself with this condition. Even after two minutes, he still struggled to tell his words to his daughter. Though eventually he fell to slumber by himself after his wife tried to put him to sleep with her eyes wet with tears.</p>\n<p>Beside her mother, Bhela picked a bamboo fan and used it to make a breeze for her father’s sleep to be more comfortable. Her expression was flat and straight the entire time, but inside, she was disturbed by the words her father failed to tell her.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>For as long as the Yashuras knew him, their Young Master Shira Yashura lived alone in his house. The only other person who should’ve been living here, his father, didn’t come home for months already. So ever since his uncle let him live in his house a few years back, Shira enjoyed an independent lifestyle he’d take for granted one of these days.</p>\n<p>At night, his schedule often filled with working on painting commissions Good-Natured Spirit gave him. Which, unfortunately, not something he wished for people to know. This part of his schedule was one of his secrets, if known by a certain meddlesome cousin, hell would surely be waiting for him.</p>\n<p>“I told you again and again,” a voice from behind him blurted, “you should’ve shown the boobs a little more.”</p>\n<p>Shira turned his head and groaned when he found the Nalaq’s annoying face a little bit too close. “Can you knock the door first?”</p>\n<p>“No way. I came through the wall. Door? What is door? Never use the thing since ages ago.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t creep up from behind, then. At least preserve your dignity as a Nalaq.”</p>\n<p>“I told you, don’t call me Nalaq,” Good-Natured Spirit hissed. “Anyway, boobs! The bweebs!! Make it more sexy! More bold and open!”</p>\n<p>“That’s not what we agreed on,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“Just a little, man. A little dot--tiny nipply dot--that’s all I’m asking for.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t push it, old man.”</p>\n<p>“Ah! You’re not fun anymore,” Good-Natured Spirit moaned in disatisfaction. In addition of Nalaq, Good-Natured Spirit was never fond of being called old. He died in his early thirty. So he retained the look, and he--according to himself--was still as handsome as ever. “Ah, forget it,” he waved his hand lazily. “Your drawings are second-rate porns anyway.”</p>\n<p>“You’re not paying for this one again?” Shira asked.</p>\n<p>“Not this one. Too safe. Don’t want it. At least make her boobs and butt bigger for the next time.”</p>\n<p>Shira sighed and wrapped it up for tonight. Everytime Good-Natured Spirit cancelled the commission's Shira wouldn’t have any choice but selling the paintings half-baked to a peddler he knew. Not even a half price, he’d be lucky if the rejected paintings would sell even one-fifth from Good-Natured Spirit’s usual payment.</p>\n<p>While Shira was tidying up his room, Good-Natured Spirit looked at the lady in the painting. The Nalaq said, “Hmm. I gotta say, man, despite your second-rate skill you’re natural when it comes to drawing faces. Especially the eyes. How should I say this… those aren’t the eyes of cheap bitches usually have, I tell you.”</p>\n<p>Shira didn’t know whether he should feel flattered or not. After he tidied the room and hid the naughty painting carefully, he prepared to go to sleep.</p>\n<p>“Oh, by the way,” Good-Natured Spirit said as Shira changed his shirt, “I’ve checked on your girl, brat. She’s a real good beauty, alright. Her talent too is not to be scoffed at. And also--boobs.”</p>\n<p>Shira glanced at him with tightened brows. “I’ll be troubled if they somehow trace it back to me in case the Young Lady of Malikh Family was assaulted.”</p>\n<p>“Hehe, relax man, I’ll never touch my buddy’s chick. We’re buddies, aren’t we?”</p>\n<p>Shira wanted to say no but he felt it’d be better for him not to comment on that. He then hurriedly kicked out the Nalaq so he could get some sleep in peace.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>In almost all of Mossack race traditions, ngajen ceremony held monthly in villages near a mountain. It was one of those legacy of ancient Mossack that still around simply because of its practice brought safety to the people. Originally was a session of prayers and offerings to calm down Selaqs which dwelling on the mountains--they had to, because many stories being passed down in every families that even ancient tribe chieftains and heroes couldn’t do nothing if waves of Selaqs rampaged over the southern lands. Though, as the cost of ceremony getting more expensive as the time went on and getting more political, nowadays it became a time of feasts for big families to assert their surrounding influence. And a time of feasts where small and independent families gained side incomes from providing food and good for the big families’ feats. Ngajen ceremony was also the main reason why there was a weird rule for every Mossack-rooted families, tribes, and clans, that saying the leaders must be someone of a great cook--the majority of them were simply foodies.</p>\n<p>“And thus, Shira my boy--” the patriarch said as he played with his thick moustache, “--us southern people are naturally different from those imperialist western Haldeens and those warmongers feudalists of eastern Kaya. We don’t simply become leaders because of our noble bloodlines or merits and achievements in battle but simply because of food. This is an important lesson, my boy: no matter one hails from a noble blood or being a simple commoner, no matter one’s an enemy or ally, in the end, everyone’s going to eat happily and peacefully when we southern cooks shove foods up in their mouths. Remember that.”</p>\n<p>Shira Yashura quietly nodded. He didn’t plan to learn cooking from the start but, as the heir of Yashura Family, spending effort on foods probably one of the most important lessons before he became the next Patriarch of Yashura Family.</p>\n<p>“So you understand. Good. Sooner or later you’ll understand being strong is not everything, having talent is not everything,” the patriarch said. “Look at your father, for instance. He’s the only one in Badril Village who has an Unique class since… I don’t know, many many years. He’s pretty badass, eh? But why is that the one who ended up being the patriarch was me?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, Uncle Shuro, please do tell me.”</p>\n<p>Shuro Yashura, the patriarch uncle, smiled as he looked at his obedient nephew. He then half-bragging said, “Because he can only boil water, that’s why. Cooking is a great heritage of our ancestors thus those who have no talent on it as to be satisfied with being a second-rate Mossack. The only reason why people like me always ended up becoming the leader of clans because we Mossack appreciate food to a very high degree. Justice is food. Food is justice. With great cooking comes great responsibility.”</p>\n<p>But from the side a sour voice butted in, “Ohh. You’ll never know how much bullshit my father made up just now.”</p>\n<p>Uncle and nephew turned their heads to see a daughter pop her head from the window. Apparently, Mila Yashura had just returned from doing morning errands.</p>\n<p>“What are you guys doing anyway?” she asked. Apparently, in the kitchen, she saw her father and cousin shredding a ridiculous amount of coconuts. No one else was here in the kitchen, so Mila asked, “Did you two really do these by all yourselves?”</p>\n<p>“Of course,” her father, the revered patriarch, said as his hand vigorously shredded coconut. He couldn’t hide the annoying proud smile on his mustache filled face.</p>\n<p>“Since dawn?” Mila asked again suspiciously.</p>\n<p>“Food is justice. Justice is food. With great cooking comes great responsibility. Shredding coconut is one of the fundamental lessons for Shira to become a great patriarch in the future.”</p>\n<p>“Well,” Mila commented, “that’s dumb.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, girl! What do you know? You know nothing about the important philosophy behind every essence of coconuts,” Shuro Yashura exploded. “Since you a girl who don’t have to lead the family then probably you’ll never understand. You’ll never have to understand the hidden substance of every food you’ve eaten! Almost every Mossack delicacies made with coconuts. That Bulayak Satay sauce you like so much is made with coconut milk as a base! And don’t forget goat stew! And baked shredded coconuts cookies! And rendang! You name it. Coconuts have been granted us with delicious foods ever since ancestors were hunters-gatherers! Our very roots of being the descendants of ancient Mossack race can be traced as long as one ponder the mystery behind every shred of coconuts! Look at ancient empires! The ancient Aratararadararam Empire, for an instance, five thousands years ago, formed their empire solely by cultivating lots of coconut trees! They’re building civilizations relying only on the blessing of coconuts! That’s how great coconuts are! Only us who were born to lead our very empire can understand how miraculous are to be feeling joyous in pondering the great essence of shredded coconuts. You don’t know this much then you’re a dumb girl, eh. What a waste of a daughter you are!!” After taking a deep breath, Patriarch Shuro snorted at his impudent daughter, then glanced at Shira, smiling. “Isn’t that right, Shira my boy?”</p>\n<p>That was dumb. Even Shira knew that much. Because of that he kept his head hung low and focused on his task of shredding coconuts, pretending not to hear the question coming at him.</p>\n<p>“See?” the patriarch smirked. “He’s too absorbed by the grace of shredding coconuts he doesn’t notice my words.”</p>\n<p>Mila rolled her eyes, began to ignore her father. “Anyway, Shira! Have you heard the story about that girl Malikh beating up the best Archer kid single-handedly?”</p>\n<p>Shira of course knew about the archery duel that happened yesterday. Because Yashura Family and Malikh Family were entangled in a planned marriage, almost everyone in Yashura Family--including servants and clueless children--were talking about it. Yet he couldn’t raise his head and answer. Do that, and his uncle Shuro would know he only pretended to be interested in shredding coconuts. He’d only hurt his uncle’s feelings that way. Thus, in spite of Mila being overly loud today, all Shira needed to do was shredding and shredding and sometimes stopped to feel the shredded coconuts with his fingers, releasing a solemn sigh, as if he found something profound in every fiber of shredded coconuts.</p>\n<p>“That’s my boy, you understand all too well after all,” Shuro Yashura nodded in satisfaction. He was relieved his successor could be that enlightened by the grace of shredded coconuts. He then glared at his own blood daughter, who supposed to be the princess of the family, nagging so loudly that she stood in borderline of being a tomboy girl and a fussy aunty.</p>\n<p>“Oh, man, just leave him alone, would ya? Just think how many years for him to catch up with his girl--the more you hold him back the more people talk shit about him, father!”</p>\n<p>“Please dear! Is that how you talk with your father? I’m not holding him back, okay?” Patriarch Shuro Yashura then asked Shira, “do I hold you back, Shira my boy?”</p>\n<p>Shira further lowered his head and pretended not to hear that as if he was a turtle.</p>\n<p>“Better be careful. He’s too deep in coconuts he doesn’t even hear me,” the patriarch gave his daughter a glare.</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura rolled her eyes. She crouched and disappeared from the window view, then stood up again a moment later. Her hand clutching a pebble.</p>\n<p>The patriarch gawked, “Oi, what are you--”</p>\n<p>Mila aimed the pebble at Shira and it hit his head with an audible knock.</p>\n<p>“Thousands of gods!” Shira swore.</p>\n<p>“Too deep my ass,” Mila sneered. Unlike her father, she knew too well whenever Shira playing dumb.</p>\n<p>“What do you want?” Shira asked as he rubbed his head.</p>\n<p>“Let’s train your sword skill. You don’t want to face your fiancée with that crappy skill of yours, do you?”</p>\n<p>Shira glanced at his uncle unwillingly. “Do I have to meet with Bhela in her Family?”</p>\n<p>“That’s right, Shira my boy. You rarely visit other houses during ngajen ceremony but old folks from the Elder Council think this is a good time to show Malikh Family our good will,” Shuro Yashura said. “Remember to pray for their patriarch’s health too. He’s your father best friend, after all.”</p>\n<p>As if waiting for Patriarch Shuro’s completed his words, the door of the kitchen knocked at the very moment. A tall gray-haired old man entered. He had a posture that was straight and sharp, classy western-style butler uniform that hadn’t had looked worn out in spite no tailors around to know how to sew the said uniform, and his hand was balanced to hold a tray with a dozen elixirs on top of it with his left hand fingers, while his right hand rested on his back as if he followed an etiquette stranger to most of the villagers. He was the sole butler in Yashura Family--and perhaps, the only butler that ever employed in Badril VIllage.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira, this month’s elixirs your father sent for you have arrived,” he said.</p>\n<p>“Thank you, Yulong.”</p>\n<p>As usual, Shira drank elixirs his father sent abroad without a rest. The content was painfully bitter, thank goodness Yulong provided brown sugars for the boy to nibble after he drank those. His father Jhuro Yashura said--in a letter from abroad--that the elixirs were some kind of nutrient custom-made only for Shira, were expensive, so they could only afford them every one or two months.</p>\n<p>“How do you feel, Shira my boy?”</p>\n<p>Shira said as he munched a brown sugar to dismiss the bitter after taste. “Uh-hm. Better?”</p>\n<p>The family always thought they were a level-boost potion, Jhuro once sent a potion that could increase Shira’s level up to Level 3 in a single gulp after all. But the elixirs seemed to do nothing other than let Shira sleep comfortably at night. Still, his relatives, especially Mila, put their hopes on the resourceful Jhuro Yashura to nurture his own son--the heir of Yashura Family.</p>\n<p>Seeing the lack of enthusiasm in his nephew’s eyes, Patriarch Shuro laughed and said, “Haha. If those don’t work on your progress problems, don’t let it bother you! Your father worked very hard as an instructor in second-rank school and he’d definitely send a better elixir, like that one from three years ago!”</p>\n<p>“Oh,” Shira nodded. The elixir from three years ago was special. He knew it the moment he drank the potion. The warm feeling surrounding his manasphere was special, as with only drinking from one bottle, he leveled up 2 levels overnight.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>After that his uncle let him go out of the kitchen, since it was promised that Shira would do errands for his aunt every morning.</p>\n<p>When he was heading off for his duty, Shira Yashura got pranked by Good-Natured Spirit in the hallway, popped out his head from a wall and cried, “Boo!”--which Shira ignored because Yulong the butler was walking behind him.</p>\n<p>Yulong said with a polite baritone voice of his, “Young Master Shira, do you perhaps would visit the peddler today?”</p>\n<p>Shira looked at the butler. The matter about him doing business with a peddler wasn’t known to the family; but since Yulong wasn’t a Yashura and had been taking care of him since little, he eventually knew about the few investment deals that Shira never talked about. After collecting his thoughts, the boy replied to Yulong’s question, “Depends on the errand I receive, really. My aunt still hasn’t given my errands this morning,” the boy said.</p>\n<p>“I see, Patriarch Shuro took your time since early morning, so if madam doesn’t take pity for you then young master would finish today’s morning errands a little too late.”</p>\n<p>“The market would be too crowded if that happened,” Shira lamented. It couldn’t be helped. Boys and girls around ages of nine and sixteen--before they received coming-of-age ceremony--had to finish several trivial tasks each morning from both parents. It was a custom mainly to educate filial piety, though some smart parents and big family policies would give errands for the young’uns to make them do things that were beneficial for their futures, like street smarts and forming their own social circles outside the playmates they met everyday. Because his mother wasn’t here since he was a baby, and his father never came home for months, it was his aunt who always gave him errands.</p>\n<p>“Young Master,” Yulong stopped him again, “I’m glad for Young Master taking initiatives to improve your life. You grow too fast for this old butler to look after you. But as a child stepping into the adult world, please let me give you a small advice.”</p>\n<p>“I’m all ears, Yulong.”</p>\n<p>Yulong said, “You cannot guarantee everyone’s nature all around you, Young Master. Especially those who come approaching you with impure motives. I hope Young Master understands this, and to not make friends with nasty people.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit, who was around, snorted.</p>\n<p>Shira pretended he didn’t hear the Nalaq and nodded at the butler’s words. “You don’t have to worry about the peddler. Even though he’s been peddling for two years now, I found the fella got a pretty good sense.”</p>\n<p>“Hearing your words relieves me greatly. Thank you.”</p>\n<p>Afterward, Yulong excused himself as he needed to check the servants’ works for the arrangement of Ngajen Ceremony. The butler unassumingly walked on the side of the corridor, avoiding Good-Natured Spirit who was floating in the way, as if he knew there was something unpleasant floating in the way.</p>\n<p>“So long, fucker,” Good-Natured Spirit flashed his middle finger to Yulong’s back who just passed him by. Of course, the old butler didn’t show any reaction to his insult.</p>\n<p>“Why did you always do that to him?” Shira said to him with a frown.</p>\n<p>“This middle finger?” Good-Natured Spirit asked back.</p>\n<p>“No, the insult.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit grinned.</p>\n<p>“You know nothing about this middle finger, eh? Hehehh heh....”</p>\n<p>Yulong was someone Shira heartily respected. He always used polite language when talking to the butler. Because of that he was irked by the way Good-Natured Spirit sneered.</p>\n<p>“I need to sell the painting you rejected before the market becomes too crowdy. Let’s go,” he said. Bantering with Good-Natured Spirit would only make him more cocky, so Shira held the urge to humor his annoying behavior and headed off to the village’s market.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Back in the kitchen, Mila stayed with his father--who still shredding coconuts--while she read from a see-through board in front of her.</p>\n<p>“Ugh… his experience didn’t even change a single point,” Mila groaned.</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro too engrossed himself in coconut to realize what his daughter was doing just now. “You did a <b>Status Window</b> on him?”</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura nodded. Her face was sour though. “Look at this, old man. See what’s wrong with the number?”</p>\n<p>“Hah, his <b>Dodge Rating</b> getting crazier than before,” Shuro Yashura said with his fingers rubbing his moustache.</p>\n<p>“No! Look, father--his combat attributes, look closely! <b>Strength</b>, <b>Agility</b>, <b>Dexterity</b>! All of them pitifully underdeveloped. And look at the <b>Wisdom</b> attribute now!”</p>\n<p>“Ooh, his Wisdom’s pretty high. I knew his head’s pretty good. No wonder he could ponder the real meaning of shredded coconuts… he’s really a wise kid, after all.”</p>\n<p>“Please be serious, father. This is a serious matter.”</p>\n<p>“I’m serious,” Shuro the patriarch frowned. “And shredded coconut is a serious matter too!”</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura took a deep breath. Getting emotional over her father’s stupidity would only complicate the conversation.</p>\n<p>“Did you really hear the nickname they gave you...?” Mila asked him as she massaged her forehead. “It’s toothless Yashura. Toothless!”</p>\n<p>“Who said that?”</p>\n<p>“People.”</p>\n<p>“Fuck them people,” Shuro said. He never heard those old fogies calling him “toothless”, so he reckoned young'uns were the ones who came up with that. He sighed. For them to call this patriarch who always held the title of the best cook in Badril Village, those young people really didn’t have a good sense in them.</p>\n<p>“Because there’s Uncle Jhuro’s watching us from behind as a patriarch you can be toothless incompetent all you want, father, but--”</p>\n<p>“Oi, mind your words!”</p>\n<p>“--But!” Mila asserted despite her father started to pout after being called an incompetent, “but my generation is going to be harsh. No one as skilled and as strong as Uncle Jhuro appeared in the young’uns to be the guardian lion as our emblem is supposed to be.”</p>\n<p>“That is maybe but what are you trying to say here?”</p>\n<p>“What I’m saying is Shira can’t afford to be another toothless patriarch. You’re a support class, father, a <b>Specialist</b> like me. In our Badril Village history no matter how great your cooking is and no matter how wide our connections are if a conflict to arise a support class as a patriarch, nobody’d take us seriously--that is, unless another Unique Class who can afford to stay here in the village appears to scare them annoying people.”</p>\n<p>“Hoo, it seems you’ve been using your head a lot recently. That’s quite surprising.”</p>\n<p>Mila pursed her lips.</p>\n<p>“Unlike a certain carefree toothless patriarch, me and most family members concerned about Shira’s progress stuck as a Level 3 Novice. And what’s more, that girl Bhela Malikh--I don’t like what she did with her hair.”</p>\n<p>“Her hair?”</p>\n<p>“She cut her hair short. I confirmed it myself.”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro shook his head. He knew what his daughter was worrying about. “Girl, nephew Bhela has been away from the village and our dull way of thinking. She had been living with people in different cultures and customs these past two years. Maybe she cut her hair because she wants to follow fashion. Like that Aunty Yarly’s girl who suddenly has her lips red with lip balms, see? The young'uns are always doing it whenever foreigners come bringing their latest fads with them. You’re thinking too much.”</p>\n<p>“Why does everyone think Bhela Malikh is just some brainless girl who doesn’t know what she’s doing?” Mila Yashura frowned. “She’s smart, father. Even Shira knows she’s smart. You know what Shira said when I told him her fiancée has short hair now?--”</p>\n<p>She smirked.</p>\n<p>“--He said, ‘the engagement’s not going to work’.”</p>\n<p>“Bah! He’s been saying that shit for years!”</p>\n<p>“I know, I know!” Mila said. “But this time he’s serious. He said that with a punchable face as if he was saying ‘see, I told you’. His face looked punchable, I tell ya!”</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura was genuinely angry. This time, Patriarch Shuro Yashura didn’t immediately reply. He looked at his daughter, scratched his head, said, “So, in short, you worried about we can’t do nothing if Bhela is serious about cutting her hair to state her stance on her own engagement?”</p>\n<p>“Well, yeah! Of course I am. Only widows who cut hairs like that!”</p>\n<p>“You think it’s because she doesn’t like being paired with our Shira who is much weaker than her?”</p>\n<p>“Well, duh, old man, you’re still asking the obvious?”</p>\n<p>“Then don’t worry, look again at his status,” Shuro Yashura tossed back the status window back to his daughter. Its lifespan hasn't yet expired, so it was still showing Shira’s attributes and status as Level 3 Novice. “See what’s wrong in there?”</p>\n<p>Mila opened her mouth, “His combat attributes--”</p>\n<p>“No, look again!” Shuro cut off.</p>\n<p>Despite knitting her eyebrows, Mila still didn’t catch his father’s drift.</p>\n<p>Seeing his daughter had a hard time figuring it out, Shuro Yashura revealed, “His elemental affinity. See?”</p>\n<p>“It’s <b>Water</b> elemental affinity. It’s not that rare. What’s wrong with it?”</p>\n<p>“Well, he’s still a Novice. Getting a class still far away from him.”</p>\n<p>When a person reached the first barrier at Level 10 and got his class, there was a chance for him to aversed in one or more elementals and largely transformed, or perhaps even enhanced, the skills he would get from the class he acquired. Not everyone, but the chance was more than fifty-fifty. Aside from the rare ones, four base elementals that commonly appeared were <b>Fire</b>, <b>Wind</b>, <b>Lightning</b>, and <b>Water</b>--Mila wasn’t sure what so special for her cousin acquired an affinity over one of those base elementals.</p>\n<p>“Have you seen anyone with an elemental affinity in his Novice years?” her father asked.</p>\n<p>“It’s rare…” Mila was unsure, “can’t say I have.”</p>\n<p>“You haven’t. I have,” Shuro Yashura said. “Twenty seven years ago. Your Uncle Jhuro had a huge fight with grandfather and he ran away into the Mossy Forest behind the mountain--for nearly three weeks. He ate wild fruits. He ate monster meat also. But in the last three days he got unlucky and got poisoned by a snake monster ten levels above him. He struggled with death. Alone in that forest. But he lived. The fool then decided the forest was too dangerous for him and he returned back home.”--and got to experience a near-death situation again after their furious father almost pummeled him to pulp, Patriarch Shuro’s memories drifted.</p>\n<p>Mila Yashura listened. She knew the story of how his uncle survived alone in Mossy Forest--it was crazy, a kind of legend for the young’uns today. That was the first story amongst stories about the Badril Village’s last Unique Class warrior--Jhuro Yashura the Blackfang Swordsman--the story that first made him famous in the village for his unordinary bravery and recklessness.</p>\n<p>Shuro Yashura asked her daughter, “You know what happened after that, right?”</p>\n<p>She nodded.</p>\n<p>“Uncle awakened his rare <b>Poison</b> elemental affinity.”</p>\n<p>And Jhuro Yashura wasn’t even reached Level 10 back then.</p>\n<p>There was an unspoken law of the system most people didn’t know. A premonition, or sign, more appropriately, that if a Novice got an elemental before acquiring a class, chance was, an Unique class would be waiting for him.</p>\n<p>“See what I’m getting at?” Shuro Yashura said with a smile. “Time will reveal it, you don’t have to worry. Sooner or later, there’ll be another Unique class in our Yashura Family.”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>That morning the family getting busy preparing for ngajen ceremony; family officials, the servants, even brats too, were busy with their own errands. Usually with a few of copper kobe coins older kids could secretly pass their morning errands to the little ones--as lazier and richer kids like Shira wasn’t foreign to the practice, but unfortunately he couldn’t find some kids to bribe even on days like this. Not that he wasn’t happy about it. The errand his aunt gave him accidentally had something to do in the market, the destination he’d go to sell his painting today anyway.</p>\n<p>“Is it me or someone’s been staring at me since I stepped out of my family’s gate?”</p>\n<p>“It’s not you,” Good-Natured Spirit replied to Shira's question. “It seems the stalker Big-Boobed Sect sent today was particularly sloopy, kinda annoying.”</p>\n<p>“Oh yeah? How many of them are following me?” Shira asked half-heartedly.</p>\n<p>“What? You don’t believe them Big-Boobed Sect always spying on us?”</p>\n<p>Shira shrugged. Good-Natured Spirit was right--the boy didn’t believe his ramblings about all-girl sect always hiding in Badril Village’s shadows, especially with those padded words about them being beautiful and having bountiful bodies. He didn’t believe it because he still got some common sense. Not to mention hidden sects, even some decent clans and schools wouldn’t bother with ordinary places like Badril Village.</p>\n<p>And thus as he had feared, the market was already crowded by then. The moment Shira realized it, Good-Natured Spirit already drifted away by the sight of excitement in gambling dens and beautiful young wives from Elzhier Family sold street foods. As it turned out, it was stamped on the Nalaq’s mind to get off Shira as soon as they came to the market lest the boy’d use him for errands one way or another. The peddler Shira acquainted with was getting a good crowd as he laid his wares behind his wagon.</p>\n<p>“Monkey!”</p>\n<p>The peddler behind the wares turned his head. He had a funny face, a rare trait that made him resemble a monkey. And there was no coincidence everyone called him Monkey. When Monkey slightly wandered his eyes through the crowd and saw Shira, he waved his hands to the grunting customers and told them he’d close his shop for a while.</p>\n<p>“Well, well, isn’t this our Young Master Shira blessing us with his presence?” the smiling Monkey briskly approached as he rubbed his palms excitedly. “Can I help you young master?”</p>\n<p>Shira stepped back when Monkey got too close. “Monkey, you better stop being creepy whenever I come visit you.”</p>\n<p>“You hurt me, young master. There’s nothing creepy about our business relationship.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, it’s your face. Don’t make me regret selling my painting to you.”</p>\n<p>“Haha, surely you jest, Young Master Shira--I’m trying my best to maintain a professional face from now on!” Monkey said that then immediately took a small peek at the content. “Your skill is just getting better and better, master. I’m sure this will sell well, Master!”</p>\n<p>“What’s with the master thing?”</p>\n<p>“How dare for me to call you ‘Young Master’ while you yourself are already an expert at this stage?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t want our relationship getting creepier than it already is,” Shira said, then he took out a pouch of coins. “Anyways, I got an errand from my aunt, so give me the thirteen dried spices worth all this money.”</p>\n<p>“What kind of spice?”</p>\n<p>“All kinds of spices.”</p>\n<p>“Of course, of course, I’ll give you a discount, just to celebrate your improvement in the path of drawing, Master.”</p>\n<p>By the time Shira got himself a basketful of spices, Monkey’s grin getting more annoying. The stereotypical fat and slimy merchants looked innocent compared to him. After Shira threw a frowning glance at him, he <em>reluctantly</em> admitted, “Young master may not know this, but recently I’ve got an Alchemist partner with me who was trying to be independent from his family,” he said. “And I must tell you, young master, this family is a many-hundreds of years Alchemists family, and you also must know he’s not kicked out of incompetente--”</p>\n<p>Shira cut his roundabout pitching. “You want me to back the Alchemist?”</p>\n<p>“Mmm...yes….” Monkey nodded with a wry smile.</p>\n<p>The boy’s eyes wandered through the peddler’s wares before looked at him in the eyes. “Even I must tread through the game of cat and dog with the elders because of the rules,” he explained to Monkey, who in turn, could only smile helplessly.</p>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>Mossack’s custom dictates children who haven’t gone through their coming of age ceremony--usually at the age of sixteen--to not being involved in politics and commerce. This is the reason why Shira--as he mostly acquired money winning through streaks of chess games with Good-Natured Spirit--couldn’t recklessly flaunt his personal wealth in public.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>The risk of having a relationship gone sour with this young master, Monkey knew that. It was unlikely for an upstart peddler to be relied on by a future patriarch of a big family, and he wholeheartedly believed it was unwise to create a trivial misunderstanding with Young Master Shira Yashura. After all, it was only one year until Shira would have his own coming of age ceremony. Therefore, Monkey didn’t want to impose on the Young Master’s kindness too much and quickly changed the topic with something he’d prepared beforehand.</p>\n<p>“This is a <b>Boost Elixir</b> concocted by my partner. He might not a 2nd-Tier Alchemist yet but I assure you, Young Master Shira, the elixir’s potent power won’t lose against any experts you’ll find anywhere!” Monkey said with his over-excited sales pitch, which made him look more funny than usual, “This humble bottle was scientifically proven to increase a person’s level as long as he is below the age of twenty! To date, this Boost Elixir has 100% effectiveness in increasing the user’s level! Young master, you are very lucky--you can have this miraculous elixir just for half of the original price today!”</p>\n<p>Though it was clear Monkey meant no harm, Shira narrowed his eyes at the pedder.</p>\n<p>“Did someone pay you to make me drink it?” he asked suspiciously.</p>\n<p>“You jest again, Young Master… ha ha… haaa….” Monkey awkwardly laughed as he tried to hide his dampened enthusiasm. “Why don’t you try it first, Young Master Shira. You don’t have to pay if you didn’t get to graduate from Level 3 Novice.”</p>\n<p>Eventually, Shira drank the Boost Elixir within a gulp, not because he believed its miraculous effect, but because he was weak for free and discounted goods.</p>\n<p>“Your EXP bar didn’t even budge a little,” Monkey muttered with a meek voice.</p>\n<p>“The liquid is surprisingly well made though. Is this really made by someone you know?”</p>\n<p>“I said before, Young Master. The one who made this hailed from an old Alchemist family that even outside South Tiramikal Kingdom their last name still can be a pretty big deal. I’m pretty confident that--normally--this elixir will have a 100% success rate for leveling up whoever drinks it!”</p>\n<p>“Such a confident boast. Are you perhaps implying that my case is not <em>normally</em>?”</p>\n<p>“He hehe, you surely joke. You know that I don’t mean any harm, young master.”</p>\n<p>Shira of course knew it. And the other thing he also knew, that if it was a really impressive elixir he just drank by now, the usual Monkey wouldn’t utter a single phrase of the word “free”, regardless how many times the elixir failed to deliver its promise.</p>\n<p>Shira looked at Monkey suspiciously, “You’re Monkey, aren’t you? Not someone brainwashed by my family’s enemy or something like that? You know, by vampires.”</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira… now your joke is not even funny--something like a poor peddler to be brainwashed only appears in stories. Vampires are some unfounded folklore.”</p>\n<p>“Monkey I know is stupid. If not brainwashed, then he definitely manipulated to sell a fake elixir to someone from big families.”</p>\n<p>Before Monkey was able to retort that, a cold voice came from the wagon. “Young Master Yashura, I don’t mind if you pinpoint Monkey’s stupidity and make assumptions about him muchever you want. But to call my elixir is fake, I can’t stand and watch around anymore.”</p>\n<p>A man appeared from the wagon Monkey had, had an appearance of the stereotypical scholar Shira had in mind--though, by the way he crossed his arms pompously, he seemed to have a pride worthy of someone hailed from big families.</p>\n<p>“You’re the Alchemist?”</p>\n<p>“Yes, you call me Snake--don’t ask for my real name,” the Alchemist said.</p>\n<p>One would hide his name if he didn’t want to be associated with his family anymore. So Shira didn’t ask. He looked at the scholarly Alchemist, then at the peddler. One was the Snake and the other one was the Monkey.</p>\n<p>Shira found some sort of strange camradice between them. “I see, so both of you decided to be a partner for life.”</p>\n<p>“Not for life, no. Spare me. It’s better for me to ditch this stupid ape as soon as he outlives his usefulness.”</p>\n<p>“Heey! Don’t say ditching in front of me!” Monkey protested. Snake ignored him without pretense, making the impression that this scene was ordinary for them.</p>\n<p>Shira then asked Snake straightforwardly.</p>\n<p>“What kind of elixir is this?”</p>\n<p>“Didn’t Monkey tell you? A Boost Elixir. My latest masterpiece,” Snake replied.</p>\n<p>“You’re aware that your partner tried to sell your masterpiece at a half price, right? I don’t even have to pay, it was what he said before.”</p>\n<p>“It was my idea,” Snake said. “This is a simple business hack. I’m confident about my concoctions. After all, I experimented heavily on human anatomy--too heavy, even, to the point folks in my family want me gone for good. I’ve got nothing to lose here. That bottle is a prototype; it cost a lot so I planned to price it a lot.”</p>\n<p>“You want to use my bad reputation as a stepping stone, don’t you?” Shira asked with a sour smile.</p>\n<p>“Yes. Do you mind?”</p>\n<p>“No, I’d gladly make profit out of those trash talking they did behind my back--though, it seems you picked the wrong guinea pig to be your mascot for your ‘business hack’,” Shira said with a wry smile.</p>\n<p>Monkey nodded weakly. As a peddler from outside the village, he was always bothered by how nasty rumors could be, especially with some acquaintance he depended on sometimes as an important business partner.</p>\n<p>Seeing that they no longer had things to chat about, Shira said to them he’d consider putting some resources if he managed to gain some nod from the family elders after he went through the coming-of-age ceremony next year. And now that he finished selling Good-Natured Spirit’s rejected commision and completed the errand his aunt gave him, Shira then bid farewell to the two animal-nicknamed gentlemen.</p>\n<p>“Please wait, Young Master Shira.”</p>\n<p>Shira turned back his head again and found Snake, the one who called him, ran back to Monkey’s wagon to grab something.</p>\n<p>“Try to drink this one,” Snake said after trotting back hurriedly. “It’s alright, you don’t have to pay for this time too.”</p>\n<p>The current elixir Snake took out was the exact opposite from the previous one. Its container was beautiful and high-class, but the content was muddy and very low in quality. Hearing that this one was also free, Shira didn’t hesitate to drink it.</p>\n<p>The after taste was incredibly sour. Unlike any other bitter concocted elixirs or potions he ever drank. Although not much, Shira could feel his body warming up. He was surprised at the unexpected reaction.</p>\n<p>“Oohhhh!!!” Monkey cried as his eyes glued at Shira’s Status Window. “The EXP bar moved!”</p>\n<p>“What?” the surprised Shira glanced at Snake and asked slowly, “This one’s free, right?”</p>\n<p>It was in a single flash Shira did catch a strange dumbfoundedness in Snake eyes, like the result even came more shocking than him than either of Shira and Monkey. Yet the moment after he promptly regained his stoic exposure, then said to Shira, “Don’t worry, I don’t plan to take back my words,”</p>\n<p>The odd Alchemist put his hands at his back and walked back to his wagon. Before he climbed the wagon, he once again glanced at Shira, looking in a state of half-disbelief like expression</p>\n<p>As Snake disappeared into the wagon, Shira and Monkey exchanged glances.</p>\n<p>“He still has that kind of face even though he promises it to be free? You sure do have an odd friend.” Shira said.</p>\n<p>Monkey grinned. “Though an oddball, I never seen anyone with more talent in alchemy than him, like, ever.”</p>\n<p>After leaving Monkey to continue his stall, Shira saw Good-Natured Spirit again when he visited a food stall not far from Monkey’s wagon. He asked what he was doing, and the Nalaq told him there was a fool who bet a lot and won a lot in the gambling games. To lose against in gambling against someone with Good-Natured Spirit’s caliber, really--Shira sighed--he couldn’t wait for his coming-of-age ceremony next year so he too could farm on these gullible people in some friendly matches--just like what he did with Good-Natured Spirit for this past one year.</p>\n<p>“You know,” munching on some satays he bought from the market, Shira muttered when he headed home along with Good-Natured Spirit, “just then I drank this elixir that really could boost my EXP a little. I don’t know how the guy concocts it, but I have the feeling that I just drink some very expensive elixir for free.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, yeah?”</p>\n<p>On the way back to Yashura Family Shira told the Nalaq spirit about the Alchemist and his elixirs. He also told him that his status that usually wouldn’t react to normal elixirs this time moved a bit after he drank a strange low-quality elixir.</p>\n<p>“That Alchemist must be a nerd to be that sharp,” Good-Natured Spirit said as he floated lazily beside the boy.</p>\n<p>“He looks like that too. The peddler he partnered with also has some good sense in him. So I thought it’s not a loss for me to use all those foreign coins I got from you to invest on them for the next year.”</p>\n<p>“Hmm,” Good-Natured Spirit crossed his arms. “I think you should be worried.”</p>\n<p>“Worried? Why?”</p>\n<p>“You said that nerd Alchemist was the one who pushed that low-quality elixir to you, right?”</p>\n<p>“I got to drink that for free,” Shira emphasized.</p>\n<p>“He realized one little secret about you then,” Good-Natured Spirit said.</p>\n<p>Shira stopped walking. He looked at him with his head tilted.</p>\n<p>“What secret?”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit who floated before, spoke again.</p>\n<p>“You shouldn’t worry about it too much for now, brat. But, I advise you, if you are still holding dear for your lazy, peaceful village life, you should turn back and kill him right now.”</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-6/chapter-3-5":"<p>What the Nalaq told Shira lingered in his mind. Good-Natured Spirit blurted something about killing someone as if it was something trivial that could popped out easily in normal conversation. To kill someone after finding out his secret--what kind of secret he needed to protect anyway? A secret he never wanted people to know the fact he was drawing semi-porns for money. But he wasn’t that insecure to kill someone over a petty secret like that? That would be him being not right in the head. The more he thought about Good-Natured Spirit’s remark, the more it disturbed him. Especially right now, when his hands painted in red, bathed in blood. When he just did an act of actual killing.</p>\n<p>“Something on your mind, Young Master Shira?” a rough voice disturbed his train of thought.</p>\n<p>“Ah,” Shira looked at a burly man, an experienced hunter, who called him.</p>\n<p>The man’s body even drenched in thicker blood than him. One would get easily nauseated by the sight of it. Yet it didn’t make the boy flinched, as he was expecting the experience for a few months already.</p>\n<p>“Here. Look at his gut. Spilling out his innards with your own hands might be a good experience for you, young master.”</p>\n<p>The hunter spun a sharp dagger, holding it by the tip of its blade, having a gesture of offering it to his young master.</p>\n<p>“Is that okay? I even had trouble when skinning the hide,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>He’d rather not, to be honest, since splitting a goat’s gut could be messy if he did it crudely. Even if he was the young master of the family, when messing with the raw meat, not even his uncle could save him from the aunties’ nagging. Shira Yashura was nearly sixteen, almost reaching adulthood, so he had to participate in butchering goats; it was a quite tasking task, but was easy enough compared to butchering cows he had to do in a few years. But for the fifteen years old young master, getting the hang of the butchering knife’s handle was plenty of experience already for him.</p>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>As the custom dictates, every month in ngajen ceremony preparation, the boys will have to deal with cows and goats while the girls help aunties plucking chickens’ and ducks’ feathers. Whether the gatekeepers' children or the family’s next heirs, all of them are required to do it every time a major ceremony approaches.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>After doing his part in butchering a goat Shira immediately took a bath to remove the bloody pungent. On a whim he then strolled to the kitchen to grab some snacks. There he witnessed how all the coconuts he and his uncle shred already transformed into delicious foods; rendang, Bulayak satay, coconut satay, spicy curry, many other mouth drolling coconut cuisines. The coconut loving uncle was all smiles and gave him a big portion of the famous beef cuisine the locals called rendang--which, normally, even for a young master like Shira would get to eat rendang once every few months. But with enough wit and experience in currying favor with his uncle, he got to taste those delicious food handed down by his uncle, the Chief Chef, personally.</p>\n<p>“Shira my boy,” Patriarch Shuro said to his nephew who was squatting below the shadow of a thick pillar, happily munching on his rendang, “you’re going to visit Malikh Family tonight. Keep a good check on your cousin. Don’t embarrass Yashura Family and present our rendang_ _for their main family.”</p>\n<p>“Sure.”</p>\n<hr>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>Domesticated cows were less in numbers than goats in Badril Village, so meals from cows, not including the innards which could be made into popular but cheap cuisines, like only served for village big shots or important visitors during the ngajen ceremony.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>Laughters and chatters made the night more merry than any other thay of the month. It was brighter than usual, as villagers came out of their house to set up big braziers to light the road between the families that were holding festives. From one hundred meters away, through the thick wall of the big families, the mouth-watering aroma of prepared food wafted through the air as if they informally invited people to come and to taste the delicacy these big families had. The change in scenery upon the arrival of the night signaled the nigh of Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>Yashura Family, the oldest family around, was known to have the best food amongst all families in Badril Village, while Elzhier Family known as the family that always threw the biggest party post-ceremony--Elzhier Family’s maidservants were beautiful and they’d show off their voluptuous bodies every single ngajen ceremony. Particularly this month however, everyone was anticipating the ceremony thrown by Malikh Family; for two years since the young lady’s absence they threw nothing more than mediocre festivities, her return was to be seen as their revival on the village’s political stage. And from how big their arrangement looked like, it seemed Malikh Family didn’t plan to fail everyone’s expectations.</p>\n<p>Shira Yashura wore the same suit he got from his uncle on his fifteenth birthday. It was the usual suit he’d wear whenever a ceremony was held. His uncle bought it from a merchant who had connections outside the kingdom, which was pretty good since the fabric wasn’t stiff, but could get unbearably itchy in places he didn’t want to scratch whenever there were people around. The obvious part missing from the wears his peers were wearing was beast pelts.</p>\n<p>Pelts from ferocious beasts were known for irrefutable proof for boys’ courage and manliness. As many young gentlemen of Badril Village wore on their necks, always looking for the opportunity to show off the trophy of their preys to girls--which translated as fashionable fads for boys who wanted to get laids.</p>\n<p>Of course, Shira, as part of the dull and no-nonsense camp of the boys in Badril Village, never had participated in that kind of indecent business. He was so dull that the only girl who would accompany him to attend ceremonies was his cousin Mila--who, even though her face was quite pretty, also happened to be in terrible luck for romance.</p>\n<p>“No matter how many times I see it, it’s always impressive to see how fast you wrap all these banana leaves,” Shira commented as he watched how Mila wrapped rendang with banana leaves. She was very good at it, comparable to the aunties’ skills that had been forged day and night in the family’s kitchen.</p>\n<p>“You talking? You’ve done your training with the family's sword technique, I assume?” Mila said with her lips pouted. Shira thought it was unusual for Mila didn’t nag her mouth off immediately when she saw him. He saw a sword wrapped in cloth near Mila. His face immediately twisted in a troubled look.</p>\n<p>“I won’t bring that thing,” he protested.</p>\n<p>“You--” Mila hissed.</p>\n<p>“What should I do with a sword inside another family’s ceremony?” Shira said. The sword was his father’s, and that was his reason he didn’t want to use it. “Look, I can only draw the blade from the sheath at most. Without a proper amount of Strength attribute I can’t swing this properly. It rejects my mana. I’d make a fool out of myself if that happened.”</p>\n<p>“That’s because you were stupidly increasing your Wisdom instead of, that’s why you--arghh! Just forget about it! I know you’re trying to make excuses! Since you’re so weak all we can do is flaunting around your father’s reputation. We’ve got to remind people that our Yashura Family’s not to mess with. Here, just slip this fucking sword in your belt.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, this is embarrassing. Those rumors are about to get worse tonight,” Shira said with a sigh. His reputation as a trash talent was annoying enough, added this shameless act of throwing his weight around, he’d become more reluctant to show his face in the public later on. But still he unwillingly slipped the sword in his belt.</p>\n<p>Mila snorted. She ignored the complaint. Right now she could care less about the rumors about her cousin. What she had to prioritize tonight was the bad premonition she had about Bhela Malikh’s short hair--nobody believed her when she said that Bhela was being a slut for cutting her hair short in spite of her being in an engagement. While her hands craftly knotted the rendang wrapped in banana leaves with a rope made with dried coconut leaves, she suddenly had a cold smile; the image of those impudent Malikhs shuddering under the famous sword of Yashura Family’s Unique Class, Jhuro Yashura the Blackfang Swordsman, entertained her she began to chuckle coldly.</p>\n<p>“Huhuhu… just you wait you bitch…”</p>\n<p>Shira stepped back. He had the hunch he should keep a distance away from his current cousin right now.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Every month, for every family in Badril Village, cooking during the Ngajen Ceremony was always a time rushing hectic. Even more in Malikh Family this time. Since the amount of food they had to deliver before the ceremony started more than twice the amount they made last month, most of the aunties in duty were cooking outdoors. The smoke from the half-dried firewood would be too unbearable for the eyes if all of them cooked in one cramped place. Fortunately, most of the dishes were already cooked and sent to the courtyard, so the only people who were still on duty preparing food were a small number of aunties and maidservants.</p>\n<p>The young maidservants were pale from tiredness but they couldn’t afford to slack in this one Ngajen Ceremony. The usual noisy aunties, they didn’t even show a sign of wanting to rest. Nobody could beat the resilience of the kitchen-duty armies when it came to preparing for a loadful of party’s foods.</p>\n<p>Usually, the one who would supervise these spartan cooking aunties would be the patriarch’s wife, Bhela’s mother. It was already a long-held tradition in the village for the patriarch to cook for the family’s important guests as the Chief Chef, while the wife supported him by supervising the aunties and maidservants. In Ngajen Ceremony this month, however, Bhela’s mother holed herself to accompany the husband on his ill-bed.</p>\n<p>She was not in the mood to meet with people. So Bhela stepped in to fill her position.</p>\n<p>Back when she was little Bhela often followed her mother working during the ngajen ceremony, she knew what she had to do by the back of her hand. In usage of salt, for example, she knew down to the tiniest detail of how much salt should be applied to different kinds of cuisines. She also instructed the inexperienced maidservants who were in charge of cooking side dishes so the overall quality of the feast would be balanced. Bhela Malikh didn’t betray everyone’s expectations about her. She did her work splendidly.</p>\n<p>However, there was a matter she saw that didn’t make her happy. The largest furnace that was usually reserved for the Chief Chef, today was used by an old man from the outer family. A great cook, the old man was. Known for his vast experience in handling the family’s food stalls for years. The problem was his common status. Without at least an elder status made it awkward for him to cook as the Chief Chef in this kitchen, even if he was a mere proxy. Bhela wondered whether the one who took the charge when her parents were unavailable knew the risk of being laughed at and criticized by the other two big families--especially now that the relationship between Yashura and Malikh wasn’t that good like before.</p>\n<p>“Young lady, the day’s getting dark, you should take a bath now and prepare yourself for the ceremony,” an aunty said to Bhela.</p>\n<p>“Yes, young lady is no longer a little girl, so making you pretty will take a while,” an early twenty maidservant added from the side. She continued, “The new girls should be able to complete the foods since you directed them a lot. Please don’t worry about us.”</p>\n<p>“I’m relieved to hear that,” Bhela said. Not yet three seconds later her eyes wandered to the old cook again. She couldn’t hide her frown.</p>\n<p>“Something the matter, Young Lady Bhela?”</p>\n<p>“Yes. Maybe it’s a misunderstanding on my part but… I can’t see the elder who would substitute my father as the Chief Chef.”</p>\n<p>Hearing Bhela said her concern, the aunties and the maidservants averted eyes with their young lady with troubled faces. Bhela then understood there was something shady going on.</p>\n<p>Her suspicion turned worse when she saw a young man in his twenties leading four manservants with him. When the aunties were working in the kitchen, it was an unspoken rule for unrelated adult men not to approach, but the battle-hardened aunties that normally were ferocious in defending their territories were all silent in welcoming the cocky visitors. It wasn’t surprising to Bhela that all of them came from Elder Jhamil’s faction.</p>\n<p>“Why aren’t you ready yet, old worm?!”</p>\n<p>“I am sorry, young elder… some dish cannot be rushed so I prepared some to--”</p>\n<p><em>Slap!!</em></p>\n<p>The slapping sound echoed in the kitchen. The room descended into a dead silent. The old cook was trembling; he lowered his head and covered the cheek that just got slapped but everyone could see the blood on the corner of his mouth. Bhela recollected her memory, and finally remembered the arrogant young man was actually Elder Jhamil’s own son.</p>\n<p>“Shit!” Elder Jhamil’s son swore, “those councils from Village Hall came. We must complete the set before too long! Those people are the ones who usually have the heaviest voice when valuing Ngajen Ceremony dishes!”</p>\n<p>One follower quipped, “Young elder is right. This old worm can’t cook shit! If this goes on, the only things the Village Hall council will remember about Elder Jhamil’s cooking is that we Malikhs cook as slow as snail!”</p>\n<p>The frown on Bhela’s face became deeper. Young elder? Before she went out for the seminars that lasted two years, this man, son of Elder Jhamil, merely a family member with a post within the family’s business. And something else that disturbed her was how she couldn’t see how the blurted about Elder Jhamil’s cooking, the one who worked in the kitchen all day, didn’t see the said elder even once today.</p>\n<p>Bhela still held her silent. But her eyes were cold and sharp judging people and the situation. The aunties and the maidservants, though they looked sympathetic with the old man, were afraid to go against Elder Jhamil’s son. Maybe because the lack of resistance Elder Jhamil’s son dared to do a taboo known in the kitchen--swapping food that wrapped in banana leaves with ceramic plates, garnished a bit, and called it the Chief Chef’s cuisine.</p>\n<p>“No, young elder!” a brave middle-aged aunty stepped forward, “you can’t do that!”</p>\n<p>“Why not?” one follower sneered in Elder Jhamil’s son’s place. “This one also got beef, isn’t it? We need to quickly serve the Chief Chef cuisine to the people from Village Hall councils.”</p>\n<p>“Exactly because they are from the Village Hall council--just from inferior cuts of the beef they’d know the dishes have been swapped! You’ll tarnish Malikh Family’s honor if people knew you were fooling--”</p>\n<p>“Fooling?!” Elder Jhamil roared.</p>\n<p>The young elder raised his hand, though the aunty who complained quickly hid back behind the maidservants. Elder Jhamil’s son then rampaged into a series of barking, yelling and threatening the aunties to cut their salary just because his mood was spoiled.</p>\n<p>His words scared all the girls and the women inside the kitchen. All except Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>After they were done swapping the foods, the young elder led his men out of the kitchen with great swagger. The young elder stopped at the door, turned around, and gave the old cook one last ultimatum: “There’ll be a noble in the ceremony so we need rendang for the main course. So go make it, old worm. You know what’s gonna happen if you couldn’t deliver, don’t you?”</p>\n<p>The old man trembled. Even the eyes on the aunties couldn’t help but shake at the threat. There was now way they could prepare rendang with only two hours remaining until the Ngajen Ceremony started.</p>\n<p>After that situation calmed down. The aunties and the maidservants went back to work. Some of them still exchanged whispered and gossiped amongst themselves. But when Bhela approached, immediately they stopped and pretended nothing happened.</p>\n<p>“Young lady…” a pudgy aunty came to her, the one who stood up against the young elder from before.</p>\n<p>“Aunty?”</p>\n<p>“We are sorry… we’ve had no meaning to show you that embarrassing scene.”</p>\n<p>Bhela shook her head. “No, I’m one from the main family bloodline; I should've been the one who stood up to him instead of hiding behind everyone.”</p>\n<p>The aunty knew the young lady didn’t say a word before because the girl wanted to know the situation. Some other middle-aged aunties who were close with Madam Malikh also knew more or less Bhela’s detached wait-and-see attitude, so no one really would blame her even if she didn’t say a word before--especially since she had just returned from overseas. The pudgy aunty tugged on Bhela’s sleeve, whispered to her ear, “Young Lady Bhela, we know you’re concerned. But we’ve already gotten used to it. You’re still young. Your future is brighter than everyone else in the family, Young Lady Bhela. It’s better to endure than pointlessly making enemies.”</p>\n<p>“This isn’t pointless,” Bhela said. She then grabbed the nearest apron and wore it. Her father was the patriarch. And she wasn’t a poster girl to draw everyone’s attention to the family.</p>\n<p>The pudgy aunty wanted to say something again. But words stuck on her throat, she closed her mouth as soon as she opened it.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the old man began to pick some mature coconut and shredded it listlessly. He got more than four decades of handling food stalls for Malikh Family, he wasn’t a stranger at cooking rendang. But he already gave up on finishing one for tonight’s Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>“Uncle, I’ll take it from here,” Bhela said as she approached the weary old man.</p>\n<p>“Ahh, yes?” the old man was started. The girl came with an apron and common garment, had fair and beautiful skin, as well clear and articulate voice; a maidservant from the inner family was the first one that came to his mind. But only when he noticed even the aunties were respectful to her and her striking bob-cut short hair that the old man began drenched in cold sweat.</p>\n<p>“I said, uncle,” Bhela repeated, “I’ll take it from here. You can rest now.”</p>\n<p>The old man vigorously shook his head.</p>\n<p>“Please Young Lady Bhela… please spare this old bone….”</p>\n<p>“This is originally my father’s post, uncle. You’ll have to be at least an elder and write your name in council’s ledger to be a substitute for my father.”</p>\n<p>The old man wanted to break into a tearless cry. This is worse than when he faced Elder Jhamil’s son's harassment before. The most thing he was afraid of was the news of Elder Jhamil using him as Chief Chef behind the scene to reach the ears of the main family. And now that Bhela Malikh was here, there was nothing he could do but to resign his life to fate.</p>\n<p>“Y-young lady!” a maidservant yelled, “you can’t!”</p>\n<p>“Who says I can’t?” Bhela asked sharply.</p>\n<p>An aunty, who had a stern-looking face, said, “You can’t cook for the main course, young lady. In case of a patriarch's absence, usually one of the elders who’s going to take his place. There’s no rule saying it’s okay for women to do it.”</p>\n<p>“Then, I’m going to ask,” from the aunty, Bhela threw her glance toward the old man, “are you an elder cooking here to substitute my father as a cook, uncle?”</p>\n<p>The old man’s face turned pale. Whichever the answer of that question would lead him to the road of punishment. All of the sudden, he became a mute.</p>\n<p>Because she had the most standing, nobody made a sound when Young Lady Bhela Malikh asked them to fetch chickens and spices for her.</p>\n<p>Not long after, the story about how the Young Lady of Malikh Family wanted to substitute her father spread like a wildfire. Never in Badril Village’s history would a young lady do that. A crowd of curious males, mostly the youngsters from main and outer of Malikh Family, surrounded the kitchen as they wanted to catch a glimpse of how their beautiful young lady recklessly challenged the custom by her own. The boys sighed in admiration. Bhela Malikh was essentially an Archer at heart. But the way she handled a blade, even if it was a kitchen knife, was skillful and graceful, as every time her slim wrist stopped moving from cutting down a vegetable, a wave of gulping could be heard. The boys couldn’t take their eyes from her. The reckless and brave young lady was simply too charming.</p>\n<p>“Did you know that foreigners often confuse rendang as dried curry?” Bhela said to one maidservant who stared at the way she cooked. “Curry leaves originated from an area close to western Haldeen lands, so many local Mossacks sailed the sea to try their luck making it big working for western empires.”</p>\n<p>The usual aloof Bhela unusually was talkative when she was cooking, which was quite a big surprise for people who were watching. She explained to the clueless maidservants how, during her two years travelling in seminars from countries to countries, found many noble owned restaurants claimed to serve rendang but turned out to be dried curry. All the while sharply focused on doing her cooking duty.</p>\n<p>“Young lady!” from the crowd came out an angry bald man. He was Elder Jhamil. “W-what are you doing there?”</p>\n<p>“I’m cooking,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“But you can’t work there!” Elder Jhamil yelled. “No woman can substitute for patriarch! That’s against the rule!”</p>\n<p>“I don’t recall we have a rule like that.”</p>\n<p>“If you know why you still stand there?”</p>\n<p>“Neither do I recall a rule for an elder to use a stand-in for the Chief Chef position.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s face turned weird as if he suddenly got constipated. Many of the youngsters didn’t catch Bhela’s remarks nor they cared too much about it, but some in the crowd were nodding knowingly, as many of them were familiar with how shady Elder Jhamil was doing things.</p>\n<p>As the bald elder’s head was racing fast looking for an answer to defuse the young lady’s claim, suddenly, a loud roar exploded behind him.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela, who do you think you are? Just because your father is the family’s patriarch you think you can do whatever you want?!”</p>\n<p>The faces of aunties and the maidservants twitched. They witnessed how the young elder harassed the old man before, so they were itching to throw back the same question at him instead, though no more brave aunties dared to cause more troubles.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s son continued, “The ingredient for making Chief dishes takes money, young lady. Not even the patriarch himself has the daring to use coins from the treasury for himself. Do you want to embarrass your parents that much?”</p>\n<p>“I’m not making this food for myself nor I cook for my father. It’s for the guests. And I provided the spices and the foreign curry leaves by myself,” Bhela said. Some maidservants behind her nodded nervously as Bhela indeed ordered them to fetch spices from the personal kitchen in the main family’s residential area.</p>\n<p>In spite of that, the young elder kept pushing on with nasty smile on his face.</p>\n<p>“What about the chicken, young lady? They cost money! What do you say about that, huh?”</p>\n<p>Behind Bhela, the aunties, even the maidservants, were whispering at each other on how ridiculous it was to question the sole young generation of Malikh Family main bloodline over some chickens. Even Bhela, the young lady in question, would only glanced at the troubled expression of Elder Jhamil.</p>\n<p>“I will pay for the chicken,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Ha? Pay? With what? Your father’s money? Can’t a sick person even pay the cost of the foods for ngajen ceremony all by himself?”</p>\n<p>“No need to bring my father’s name here.” Bhela said with a dangerously cold tone.</p>\n<p>The chillness in her eyes was telling that she really did hate people bringing her parents’ name in bad faith. After hearing gasps of surprise from people that didn’t expect the usually silent young lady could utter something with such a biting tone, she sighed, said with an explanation, “I got a dress as a gift from a certain person who has too much money in his pocket. He said the dress is so valuable even the princesses wear them in parties. It should cover the cost of these chickens I’m going to cook if I sell the dress right here right now.”</p>\n<p>Bhela then tilted her head and glanced at the bald elder.</p>\n<p>“Am I right, Elder Jhamil?”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil wanted to maintain his smile, but his face went stiff as stone. He was trembling inside for knowing that the dress he acquired with a large sum of money and with his best connection, valued the same as some mere village chickens in Bhela’s eyes.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, his son, who was taken aback for a bit from the cold remark Bhela had said earlier, recovered, began to yell again, “Ha! Did you not train your brain when you were overseas, my young lady? The same dress princesses wear in parties? Only someone dumb believe that! Hah! Obviously you’ve been lied to! You’ve been crooked, young lady, crooked--”</p>\n<p><em>Paak!</em></p>\n<p>From behind, the already red-faced Elder Jhamil smacked his son’s head. “You’ve been rude to Young Lady Bhela, you dumbskull! You have to apologize! Young lady can’t bear to hear it anymore!”</p>\n<p>While in fact it was him who couldn’t bear to hear being called a crook.</p>\n<p>“Apologize!” Elder Jhamil roared.</p>\n<p><em>Splash!</em></p>\n<p>The pair father and son’s performance didn’t amuse Bhela, however. With the lid in her hand, Bhela scooped boiling curry broth and splashed it to their direction. Surprised, the stupid young elder swore with nasty words while his father cried in high-pitched voice.</p>\n<p>“Please get out,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil laughed wryly.</p>\n<p>“Please don’t be like that, young lady. I know my son doesn't have the best education but--”</p>\n<p><em>Splash!!</em></p>\n<p>Bhela waved the cooking lid once again as soon as Elder Jhamil stepped forward. The hot water splashed on his expensive boots. This time, while he didn’t expect for Bhela splashing hot water at him again, he wasn’t freaking out. It seemed his plan to make the young lady behave a little backfiring instead. His face turned solemn.</p>\n<p>“Young lady…”</p>\n<p>“I’m not going to say it thrice--everyone who has nothing to do in the kitchen, please get out,” Bhela said. “Or else--”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The major families’ lands were astonishingly spacious and complex, their walls were thick and tall, therefore each of them employed a few stationary guards for the main gate as gatekeepers. These gatekeepers, though usually filled by members of the outer part of the families, their duty were significantly more important than others since they represented the face of the family they served. So they always maintain polite gestures to everyone who came through their gate, either commoners or rich people from big families. Yet when Shira and Mila arrived the Malikh Family’s gatekeepers didn’t even hide their scoffs.</p>\n<p>“Ridiculous!” she hissed with a face boiled in anger, “even lowly gatekeepers are looking down on us!”</p>\n<p>“Don’t bother with them,” Shira said. Unlike his cousin’s furious temper, his flair seemed like he shrugged the blatant disrespect, as the holder of “Eternal Novice” title he was already numb by how people were talking behind his back.</p>\n<p>“If your father was here they’d bow their asses as soon as they saw us Yashura coming.”</p>\n<p>Shira shrugged his shoulders again.</p>\n<p>Still seething in anger, Mila cast her eyes on the banana leaves wrapped food in Shira’s hands. “Who should we give the rendang to?” she asked.</p>\n<p>“Let’s just give it to a random servant.” Then Shira called a maidservant who was carrying a tray full of food. “Excuse me!”</p>\n<p>“Yes? What can I help y--” The moment this maidservant turned her head and saw Shira’s face, she immediately threw back her eyes and escaped with hurried trot, pretending she saw nothing.</p>\n<p>“The fuck?!” Mila was flastergabbed, didn’t know what to say.</p>\n<p>Later on Shira and Mila realized how unpopular Yashura Family was to the current Malikhs, even the servants who usually held no voice in the family were avoiding the pair of cousins like plague. Their attitude especially worsened when it came to Shira Yashura.</p>\n<p>“Look there,” someone whispered amongst the guests, “Yashura Family send their eldest young miss and the young master! Out of all the Ngajen Ceremony, they choose tonight to show their faces--pretty obvious, eh? Bet they’re drooling to get another Unique Class after knowing our Young Lady Bhela’s real talent tonight!”</p>\n<p>Someone else agreed and replied, “With that kind of trash as their young master, they’d be dreamin’ to get even a touch of our Young Lady Bhela. Pueh!”</p>\n<p>Hearing the muffled disdain, Mila Yashura whirled her body, glaring people with eagle eyes. “Who said that?!” she growled.</p>\n<p>“Mila…” Shira held her shoulder.</p>\n<p>“The fuckers don’t even put our Yashura Family in their eyes. Just because shitty rumors about Unique Class they started to feel high and mighty, eh?”</p>\n<p>“Just let go, Uncle Shuro didn’t send us here to start troubles,” Shira said. “All we need to do is to show our faces here and give them our rendang. It’s not our problem whether they welcome our good intention with grace or not.”</p>\n<p>Though Shira said that, he secretly hoped Malikh Family would grow too proud to receive it--all so he had an excuse to keep his uncle’s rendang for himself.</p>\n<p>A commotion arose. People hussing here and there with excitement. When Shira and Mila wanted to know what was going on, a parade of beautiful young women glittering and stealing the whole show came from inside of Malikh Family’s hall. Leading them was a short-haired young beauty, face as icy as an ice sculpture, the recent name that everyone had been talking about these days, Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>It was clear from the way Bhela positioned herself she represented the family as the ceremony’s Chief Chef.</p>\n<p>“Whoa, so Malikh Family let her do that,” Shira murmured.</p>\n<p>Not to mention being the Chief Chef--the most Shira did in his family’s kitchen was helping his uncle, helping him shred coconuts. They were at the same age, but the same old Shira still practiced butchering goats while the supposed fiancée of his was climbing the social ladder. Even Mila was angry by the special treatment Malikh Family gave to their young lady.</p>\n<p>“Sup, young master!” from behind a voice called him.</p>\n<p>Shira turned around, found the one who greeted him was Monkey.</p>\n<p>“Who?” Mila asked Shira as the stranger with a monkey-like face approaching.</p>\n<p>“This one is called by the name of Monkey, young lady,” Monkey, with his self-trained Mossack’s style bowing gesture, introduced himself smoothly.</p>\n<p>Mila hummed in ackwnoledgement. It was harder to forget than remembering someone with such combination of face and awkward name.</p>\n<p>“Mister Monkey, I thought you’ll spend the ceremony to show Mister Snake around since he’s an outsider. What are you doing in Malikh Family?” Shira asked.</p>\n<p>“Now, now, please drop the ‘Mister’, young master. I’m not that old yet to be called as such,” Monkey said, then he continued explaining his story this evening. “We were planning to go to your family’s ceremony, young master. But who would have thought Snake to meet with his relatives here? His relatives are actually Malikh Family’s guests for tonight’s Ngajen Ceremony. Bet he got to eat expensive cuisines right now.”</p>\n<p>“Well, it’ll be easier with Mister Snake here. I’ve got some coins I want to show you, I wonder if it works to use them for--” Shira sneakily glanced at his cousin, then turned back to Monkey like it was nothing, “--for the thing we talked about yesterday.”</p>\n<p>Mila sneered, “You have some business to attend, no?”</p>\n<p>“Not really, no,” Shira shrugged off her question.</p>\n<p>“Really, though?” Mila crossed her arms, sneered again. “I think I saw Romana just now. I’mma chat with her a little bit.”</p>\n<p>It seemed to Shira that his cousin meeting with Romana here, in Malikh Family’s Ngajen Ceremony, wasn’t simply to have fun. He didn’t like his cousin would make trouble but he didn’t want to spend the whole night with her either. “Don’t go home without me,” he said eventually.</p>\n<p>“Hmph! You’re not a kid anymore but still need me to accompany you home?”</p>\n<p>No, Shira actually was more worried about her than himself.</p>\n<p>He then glanced beside and said, “Mister Monkey.”</p>\n<p>“Just Monkey,” Monkey corrected.</p>\n<p>“Mister Just Monkey, you said Mister Snake with relative? And his relatives are Malikh Family’s guests?”</p>\n<p>“Not Just Mon--ah, forget about it,” Monkey already gave up guessing whether Young Master Shira Yashura was purposely pulling his leg or not. “They really were Malikh Family’s guests, they even got the front row for the prayer and all.”</p>\n<p>“Is hard for us to be friendly if Mister Snake is involved with Malikh Family.”</p>\n<p>“You mean, that, huh? Well, I’ve been here for a while and they talked about you a lot, so I guess even someone as chill as you can get angry sometimes. But you don’t have to worry about those Malikhs, Young Master Shira. As long as their patriarch is Ghalim Malikh they won’t sever ties with Yashura so easily.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, is this your opinion?”</p>\n<p>“It’s Snake’s. It’s what he said before he met his relatives.”</p>\n<p>Shira thought the Alchemist he met once before was a total stranger of Badril Village, but it appeared he was wrong. “He really does know about Malikh Family that much, doesn’t he?”</p>\n<p>“Well, yeah, but I think he’s more familiar with Yashura than Malikh Family, though,” Monkey said, crossing his arms and nodded to himself as he recalled things that Snake told him to get his wares supported by Yashura Family; for example, obtaining Butler Yulong’s permission the same as Patriarch Shuro Yashura’s, Snake once said.</p>\n<p>“What? Why do you make that kind of face, Young Master Shira?” Monkey was snapped from his train of thought.</p>\n<p>“Ah, no, I just don’t expect you’re going to say some like that.”</p>\n<p>“What are you saying, young master. In the first place, Snake became my crew because he heard I’ve some dealing with Yashura Family.”</p>\n<p>Shira did recall the first time Monkey contacted Yashura Family--through him. To be more exact, the first item Monkey dealt from Malikh Family was Shira’s smuggled erotic painting that Good-Natured Spirit rejected.</p>\n<p>“--Speaking of Snake,” with his thumb Monkey did point in a certain direction. The place was separated from the common guest as they indeed were Malikh Family’s special guests. Shira’s eyes followed and he saw the familiar Alchemist he knew not long ago, Snake, was talking with two men, young and old, most likely brother and his grandfather.</p>\n<p>“Don’t be fooled by their appearances, young master. They’re renowned experts,” Monkey said.</p>\n<p>The pair of brother and grandfather wore worn out pale robes as their clothes, unlike the image of revered experts in Shira’s mind. Monkey told him both likely to travel incognito for various reasons. The old man had an old white hair and long beard, his back crooked and had to bring a walking staff to support himself, and gave people the impression of a sleepy grandpa from the dim light on his eyes. The young one though, had an always angry-looking face with fierce brows, crossing his muscle-thick arms, locked in a debate with Snake. Snake’s face was notably paler than when Shira met him in the market.</p>\n<p>“We can’t greet Mister Snake now, can we?” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think we can,” Monkey said. Even though he long considered Snake as his partner, the two guests appearing incognito were still the main members of the revered Alchemist family. This was no time for commoners like him acting friendly on them all of the sudden.</p>\n<p>The sleepy-looking old man, noticing two pairs of eyes looking at him, he raised his head. He caught the sight of Shira. Their eyes met.</p>\n<p>“Oh ho,” the old man smiled when he found the boy. He dragged his old body to approach the flastergabbed Shira and Monkey.</p>\n<p>Even Monkey who knew more about them wouldn’t expect Snake’s relatives to introduce themselves first.</p>\n<p>“He’s heading this way…”</p>\n<p>“Ah, yes, apparently.”</p>\n<p>Monkey gulped. “It’s different with Snake. Although he looked like that, whatever you do, please, young master, you can’t afford to be rude in front of this elder…”</p>\n<p>From the nervousness in Monkey’s voice Shira found the approaching old man seemed to hail from a more prestigious family than he originally thought.</p>\n<p>“Greeting, elder,” Shira said with his head humbly lowered as soon as he approached.</p>\n<p>The old man chuckled, patted Shira’s head, said, “Ah, Young Master, look how much you’ve grown. It feels like only yesterday how happy you were running around like a little kid you are.”</p>\n<p>Shira nodded hearing that. He glanced beside him, and caught Monkey’s face flabbergasted looking both at the boy and the old man.</p>\n<p>Hiding his embarrassment behind a fake cough, Shira then tried to understand whether the old man mistook him for someone else. “I’m sorry, elder. I don’t know if I’m mistaken, but, have we met before?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, have we met? Of course we’ve--” he stopped. The old man's eyes were covered by a pair of soft hands of a girl.</p>\n<p>“Guess who this is?” the girl who sneakily teased the old man from behind was grinning.</p>\n<p>“Oho! Who is this? Who is this?” the old man smiled delightedly.</p>\n<p>Both Shira and Monkey were tense watching the scene before them. Especially Shira Yashura, who knew that the grin on his cousin’s face always told that the girl enjoyed herself a little bit too much.</p>\n<p>“Isn’t this… Tomboy Princess?” the old man guessed.</p>\n<p>“Tuut! Wrong!”</p>\n<p>Mila released her hands. When the old man turned to see the preparator, he exclaimed with a chuckle.</p>\n<p>“It’s really you, Tomboy Princess.”</p>\n<p>Mila excitedly echoed, “It’s really you, Grandpa Piss!”</p>\n<p>They were so glad they met after a long time that they started to hug each other. Then Mila pull herself from the oldman’s embrace, yelling, “Ugghh…” she pinched her nose, “I smell something pissy around here.”</p>\n<p>Just when Shira and Monkey wondered what Mila meant by that, the girl looked at the old man, saying, “It’s no wonder it smells pissy. Have you taken a bath, Grandpa Piss.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss answered with a laugh. But Shira and Monkey facepalmed.</p>\n<p>So much for being mindful in front of the revered old expert.</p>\n<p>Shira awkwardly smiled to cover his shame. “Mila, you should be mindful in front of elders.”</p>\n<p>“Mindful?” Mila gasped. “In front of Grandpa Piss? Why?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, it’s okay, young master,” the old man said as he waved his hand. “I’m not that old to lose my sense of humor. Yashura Family’s princess sure is as naughty as always.” His wrinkles deepened as he curled his lips into a big smile. He said to Mila, “I reckon Patriarch Shuro’s been well, my princess? I recall he got a lot of migraines back in the day.”</p>\n<p>Haughtily, Mila replied, “Don’t worry about that guy, Grandpa Piss. His brain capacity has been declining these past years so there’s really nothing left inside to give him any headache!”</p>\n<p>“Ehem,” Shira cleared his phlegm. “She meant our patriarch has been well, elder.”</p>\n<p>“That’s what I said,” Mila laughed, and the old man laughed too. After that Mila kissed Grandpa Piss’s right hand as if she was kissing an elder’s hand from her own family, then continued laughing as cheeky as always.</p>\n<p>“My naughty princess,” Grandpa Piss ruffled Mila’s hair, “I planned to visit Yashura Family later. But since we’ve already met, here, please take this.”</p>\n<p>Receiving a pack wrapped in dried leaves, Mila pouted her lips. “You wouldn’t be lying about this being a candy again, would you?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, of course not.”</p>\n<p>As far as her memory served her well, what Grandpa Piss called candy actually a really bitter herb for young children to gain their appetite. Mila sniffed. She opened it and have a little taste. “Uuueeekk!”</p>\n<p>It was sour and even more bitter than she remembered. “What the hell is this?!”</p>\n<p>“That herb’s not for consumption, Young Lady Mila” the big man with muscles, Snake’s big brother, said from behind Grandpa Piss. He was smiling politely despite the other party merely a young lady of a rural village. “It’s a cosmetic for skin care.”</p>\n<p>“Skin care?!”</p>\n<p>Mila’s mouth widened agape. But soon as she glanced at the muscle man who was approaching her, she became wary, leaned to Grandpa Piss and whispered, “Grandpa Piss, who’s that?”</p>\n<p>With a patient smile replied, Grandpa Piss said, “He’s Snotty. Don’t you remember Snotty?”</p>\n<p>Mila was surprised. “Oooohh! Snotty! You’ve turned into a real man now I can’t even recognize you anymore!”</p>\n<p>“Haha… you’re surely jest young lady,” Snotty said.</p>\n<p>“No, really…” with fingers on her chin, eyes on muscles, Mila added, “you really transformed into something new, Snotty. I’m impressed. You were so skinny and really a snotty boy back then.”</p>\n<p>The man continued to laugh. The atmosphere was friendly and harmless. Yet Monkey, who had long heard Snotty’s real identity and preceding reputation from Snake’s mouth, began sweating profusely.</p>\n<p>Mila really loved gifted cosmetics and the like. After knowing how effective it was for her beauty, she shamelessly asked, “Can I ask for more, Grandpa Piss? I have a good friend who needs to be a beauty--as soon as possible!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, of course I have more--here, take this,” Grandpa Piss took out another one.</p>\n<p>“Waow!” Mila’s eyes sparkled in a weird glint. Shira, who saw that, knew his cousin’s greed began to surface; suddenly the unruly young lady acted as if she was a timid maiden. “Grandpa Piss… I think my other friend needs it too…” she asked sweetly.</p>\n<p>“Hohoh!” Grandpa Piss stroked his beard again. “Unfortunately, my princess, I’ve got only three pack and I planned to give the last one for Young Lady Malikh.”</p>\n<p>Hearing a certain short-haired girl being mentioned, the shy maiden’s face twisted in an ugly sour face, returned back to her original color. “Tch.”</p>\n<p>“Hey, don’t click your tongue in front of elders,” Shira warned her.</p>\n<p>“Tch.” Mila crossed her arms and threw away her pouting face.</p>\n<p>Shira was always frustrated whenever a younger one like him would be the one to reprimand ethics into this blockhead of a girl.</p>\n<p>“Now, now, young lady. Please remember Grandpa’s already too old to concoct too many cosmetics--getting two packs already good enough,” Snotty said.</p>\n<p>Snake looked at the leaves wrapped cosmetics in Mila’s hands and exclaimed, “Grandfather concocted them himself?”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss nodded with an amiable smile. “Of course. Been twelve years since the last time I was here. It’d be embarrassing if I came with half-hearted gifts, don’t you think so?”</p>\n<hr>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>The nickname of “Grandpa Piss” stuck on Grandmaster Alchemist’s name for twelve years. When a friend of his asked the origin of this horrible nickname, the Grandmaster laughed it off and said a princess of his old friend’s family started calling him that, because her cousin who was still a three years old brat urinated on him every time the Grandmaster tried to hug him.</p>\n<p>Legend said that the princess was also calling the heir of Grandmaster Alchemist’s family with the nickname of “Snotty”. But even to this day, nobody knows which kingdom this cheeky princess comes from.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n","volume-6/chapter-3":"<p>What the Nalaq told Shira lingered in his mind. Good-Natured Spirit blurted something about killing someone as if it was something trivial that could popped out easily in normal conversation. To kill someone after finding out his secret--what kind of secret he needed to protect anyway? A secret he never wanted people to know the fact he was drawing semi-porns for money. But he wasn’t that insecure to kill someone over a petty secret like that? That would be him being not right in the head. The more he thought about Good-Natured Spirit’s remark, the more it disturbed him. Especially right now, when his hands painted in red, bathed in blood. When he just did an act of actual killing.</p>\n<p>“Something on your mind, Young Master Shira?” a rough voice disturbed his train of thought.</p>\n<p>“Ah,” Shira looked at a burly man, an experienced hunter, who called him.</p>\n<p>The man’s body even drenched in thicker blood than him. One would get easily nauseated by the sight of it. Yet it didn’t make the boy flinched, as he was expecting the experience for a few months already.</p>\n<p>“Here. Look at his gut. Spilling out his innards with your own hands might be a good experience for you, young master.”</p>\n<p>The hunter spun a sharp dagger, holding it by the tip of its blade, having a gesture of offering it to his young master.</p>\n<p>“Is that okay? I even had trouble when skinning the hide,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>He’d rather not, to be honest, since splitting a goat’s gut could be messy if he did it crudely. Even if he was the young master of the family, when messing with the raw meat, not even his uncle could save him from the aunties’ nagging. Shira Yashura was nearly sixteen, almost reaching adulthood, so he had to participate in butchering goats; it was a quite tasking task, but was easy enough compared to butchering cows he had to do in a few years. But for the fifteen years old young master, getting the hang of the butchering knife’s handle was plenty of experience already for him.</p>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>As the custom dictates, every month in ngajen ceremony preparation, the boys will have to deal with cows and goats while the girls help aunties plucking chickens’ and ducks’ feathers. Whether the gatekeepers' children or the family’s next heirs, all of them are required to do it every time a major ceremony approaches.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>After doing his part in butchering a goat Shira immediately took a bath to remove the bloody pungent. On a whim he then strolled to the kitchen to grab some snacks. There he witnessed how all the coconuts he and his uncle shred already transformed into delicious foods; rendang, Bulayak satay, coconut satay, spicy curry, many other mouth drolling coconut cuisines. The coconut loving uncle was all smiles and gave him a big portion of the famous beef cuisine the locals called rendang--which, normally, even for a young master like Shira would get to eat rendang once every few months. But with enough wit and experience in currying favor with his uncle, he got to taste those delicious food handed down by his uncle, the Chief Chef, personally.</p>\n<p>“Shira my boy,” Patriarch Shuro said to his nephew who was squatting below the shadow of a thick pillar, happily munching on his rendang, “you’re going to visit Malikh Family tonight. Keep a good check on your cousin. Don’t embarrass Yashura Family and present our rendang_ _for their main family.”</p>\n<p>“Sure.”</p>\n<hr>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>Domesticated cows were less in numbers than goats in Badril Village, so meals from cows, not including the innards which could be made into popular but cheap cuisines, like only served for village big shots or important visitors during the ngajen ceremony.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n<p>Laughters and chatters made the night more merry than any other thay of the month. It was brighter than usual, as villagers came out of their house to set up big braziers to light the road between the families that were holding festives. From one hundred meters away, through the thick wall of the big families, the mouth-watering aroma of prepared food wafted through the air as if they informally invited people to come and to taste the delicacy these big families had. The change in scenery upon the arrival of the night signaled the nigh of Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>Yashura Family, the oldest family around, was known to have the best food amongst all families in Badril Village, while Elzhier Family known as the family that always threw the biggest party post-ceremony--Elzhier Family’s maidservants were beautiful and they’d show off their voluptuous bodies every single ngajen ceremony. Particularly this month however, everyone was anticipating the ceremony thrown by Malikh Family; for two years since the young lady’s absence they threw nothing more than mediocre festivities, her return was to be seen as their revival on the village’s political stage. And from how big their arrangement looked like, it seemed Malikh Family didn’t plan to fail everyone’s expectations.</p>\n<p>Shira Yashura wore the same suit he got from his uncle on his fifteenth birthday. It was the usual suit he’d wear whenever a ceremony was held. His uncle bought it from a merchant who had connections outside the kingdom, which was pretty good since the fabric wasn’t stiff, but could get unbearably itchy in places he didn’t want to scratch whenever there were people around. The obvious part missing from the wears his peers were wearing was beast pelts.</p>\n<p>Pelts from ferocious beasts were known for irrefutable proof for boys’ courage and manliness. As many young gentlemen of Badril Village wore on their necks, always looking for the opportunity to show off the trophy of their preys to girls--which translated as fashionable fads for boys who wanted to get laids.</p>\n<p>Of course, Shira, as part of the dull and no-nonsense camp of the boys in Badril Village, never had participated in that kind of indecent business. He was so dull that the only girl who would accompany him to attend ceremonies was his cousin Mila--who, even though her face was quite pretty, also happened to be in terrible luck for romance.</p>\n<p>“No matter how many times I see it, it’s always impressive to see how fast you wrap all these banana leaves,” Shira commented as he watched how Mila wrapped rendang with banana leaves. She was very good at it, comparable to the aunties’ skills that had been forged day and night in the family’s kitchen.</p>\n<p>“You talking? You’ve done your training with the family's sword technique, I assume?” Mila said with her lips pouted. Shira thought it was unusual for Mila didn’t nag her mouth off immediately when she saw him. He saw a sword wrapped in cloth near Mila. His face immediately twisted in a troubled look.</p>\n<p>“I won’t bring that thing,” he protested.</p>\n<p>“You--” Mila hissed.</p>\n<p>“What should I do with a sword inside another family’s ceremony?” Shira said. The sword was his father’s, and that was his reason he didn’t want to use it. “Look, I can only draw the blade from the sheath at most. Without a proper amount of Strength attribute I can’t swing this properly. It rejects my mana. I’d make a fool out of myself if that happened.”</p>\n<p>“That’s because you were stupidly increasing your Wisdom instead of, that’s why you--arghh! Just forget about it! I know you’re trying to make excuses! Since you’re so weak all we can do is flaunting around your father’s reputation. We’ve got to remind people that our Yashura Family’s not to mess with. Here, just slip this fucking sword in your belt.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, this is embarrassing. Those rumors are about to get worse tonight,” Shira said with a sigh. His reputation as a trash talent was annoying enough, added this shameless act of throwing his weight around, he’d become more reluctant to show his face in the public later on. But still he unwillingly slipped the sword in his belt.</p>\n<p>Mila snorted. She ignored the complaint. Right now she could care less about the rumors about her cousin. What she had to prioritize tonight was the bad premonition she had about Bhela Malikh’s short hair--nobody believed her when she said that Bhela was being a slut for cutting her hair short in spite of her being in an engagement. While her hands craftly knotted the rendang wrapped in banana leaves with a rope made with dried coconut leaves, she suddenly had a cold smile; the image of those impudent Malikhs shuddering under the famous sword of Yashura Family’s Unique Class, Jhuro Yashura the Blackfang Swordsman, entertained her she began to chuckle coldly.</p>\n<p>“Huhuhu… just you wait you bitch…”</p>\n<p>Shira stepped back. He had the hunch he should keep a distance away from his current cousin right now.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Every month, for every family in Badril Village, cooking during the Ngajen Ceremony was always a time rushing hectic. Even more in Malikh Family this time. Since the amount of food they had to deliver before the ceremony started more than twice the amount they made last month, most of the aunties in duty were cooking outdoors. The smoke from the half-dried firewood would be too unbearable for the eyes if all of them cooked in one cramped place. Fortunately, most of the dishes were already cooked and sent to the courtyard, so the only people who were still on duty preparing food were a small number of aunties and maidservants.</p>\n<p>The young maidservants were pale from tiredness but they couldn’t afford to slack in this one Ngajen Ceremony. The usual noisy aunties, they didn’t even show a sign of wanting to rest. Nobody could beat the resilience of the kitchen-duty armies when it came to preparing for a loadful of party’s foods.</p>\n<p>Usually, the one who would supervise these spartan cooking aunties would be the patriarch’s wife, Bhela’s mother. It was already a long-held tradition in the village for the patriarch to cook for the family’s important guests as the Chief Chef, while the wife supported him by supervising the aunties and maidservants. In Ngajen Ceremony this month, however, Bhela’s mother holed herself to accompany the husband on his ill-bed.</p>\n<p>She was not in the mood to meet with people. So Bhela stepped in to fill her position.</p>\n<p>Back when she was little Bhela often followed her mother working during the ngajen ceremony, she knew what she had to do by the back of her hand. In usage of salt, for example, she knew down to the tiniest detail of how much salt should be applied to different kinds of cuisines. She also instructed the inexperienced maidservants who were in charge of cooking side dishes so the overall quality of the feast would be balanced. Bhela Malikh didn’t betray everyone’s expectations about her. She did her work splendidly.</p>\n<p>However, there was a matter she saw that didn’t make her happy. The largest furnace that was usually reserved for the Chief Chef, today was used by an old man from the outer family. A great cook, the old man was. Known for his vast experience in handling the family’s food stalls for years. The problem was his common status. Without at least an elder status made it awkward for him to cook as the Chief Chef in this kitchen, even if he was a mere proxy. Bhela wondered whether the one who took the charge when her parents were unavailable knew the risk of being laughed at and criticized by the other two big families--especially now that the relationship between Yashura and Malikh wasn’t that good like before.</p>\n<p>“Young lady, the day’s getting dark, you should take a bath now and prepare yourself for the ceremony,” an aunty said to Bhela.</p>\n<p>“Yes, young lady is no longer a little girl, so making you pretty will take a while,” an early twenty maidservant added from the side. She continued, “The new girls should be able to complete the foods since you directed them a lot. Please don’t worry about us.”</p>\n<p>“I’m relieved to hear that,” Bhela said. Not yet three seconds later her eyes wandered to the old cook again. She couldn’t hide her frown.</p>\n<p>“Something the matter, Young Lady Bhela?”</p>\n<p>“Yes. Maybe it’s a misunderstanding on my part but… I can’t see the elder who would substitute my father as the Chief Chef.”</p>\n<p>Hearing Bhela said her concern, the aunties and the maidservants averted eyes with their young lady with troubled faces. Bhela then understood there was something shady going on.</p>\n<p>Her suspicion turned worse when she saw a young man in his twenties leading four manservants with him. When the aunties were working in the kitchen, it was an unspoken rule for unrelated adult men not to approach, but the battle-hardened aunties that normally were ferocious in defending their territories were all silent in welcoming the cocky visitors. It wasn’t surprising to Bhela that all of them came from Elder Jhamil’s faction.</p>\n<p>“Why aren’t you ready yet, old worm?!”</p>\n<p>“I am sorry, young elder… some dish cannot be rushed so I prepared some to--”</p>\n<p><em>Slap!!</em></p>\n<p>The slapping sound echoed in the kitchen. The room descended into a dead silent. The old cook was trembling; he lowered his head and covered the cheek that just got slapped but everyone could see the blood on the corner of his mouth. Bhela recollected her memory, and finally remembered the arrogant young man was actually Elder Jhamil’s own son.</p>\n<p>“Shit!” Elder Jhamil’s son swore, “those councils from Village Hall came. We must complete the set before too long! Those people are the ones who usually have the heaviest voice when valuing Ngajen Ceremony dishes!”</p>\n<p>One follower quipped, “Young elder is right. This old worm can’t cook shit! If this goes on, the only things the Village Hall council will remember about Elder Jhamil’s cooking is that we Malikhs cook as slow as snail!”</p>\n<p>The frown on Bhela’s face became deeper. Young elder? Before she went out for the seminars that lasted two years, this man, son of Elder Jhamil, merely a family member with a post within the family’s business. And something else that disturbed her was how she couldn’t see how the blurted about Elder Jhamil’s cooking, the one who worked in the kitchen all day, didn’t see the said elder even once today.</p>\n<p>Bhela still held her silent. But her eyes were cold and sharp judging people and the situation. The aunties and the maidservants, though they looked sympathetic with the old man, were afraid to go against Elder Jhamil’s son. Maybe because the lack of resistance Elder Jhamil’s son dared to do a taboo known in the kitchen--swapping food that wrapped in banana leaves with ceramic plates, garnished a bit, and called it the Chief Chef’s cuisine.</p>\n<p>“No, young elder!” a brave middle-aged aunty stepped forward, “you can’t do that!”</p>\n<p>“Why not?” one follower sneered in Elder Jhamil’s son’s place. “This one also got beef, isn’t it? We need to quickly serve the Chief Chef cuisine to the people from Village Hall councils.”</p>\n<p>“Exactly because they are from the Village Hall council--just from inferior cuts of the beef they’d know the dishes have been swapped! You’ll tarnish Malikh Family’s honor if people knew you were fooling--”</p>\n<p>“Fooling?!” Elder Jhamil roared.</p>\n<p>The young elder raised his hand, though the aunty who complained quickly hid back behind the maidservants. Elder Jhamil’s son then rampaged into a series of barking, yelling and threatening the aunties to cut their salary just because his mood was spoiled.</p>\n<p>His words scared all the girls and the women inside the kitchen. All except Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>After they were done swapping the foods, the young elder led his men out of the kitchen with great swagger. The young elder stopped at the door, turned around, and gave the old cook one last ultimatum: “There’ll be a noble in the ceremony so we need rendang for the main course. So go make it, old worm. You know what’s gonna happen if you couldn’t deliver, don’t you?”</p>\n<p>The old man trembled. Even the eyes on the aunties couldn’t help but shake at the threat. There was now way they could prepare rendang with only two hours remaining until the Ngajen Ceremony started.</p>\n<p>After that situation calmed down. The aunties and the maidservants went back to work. Some of them still exchanged whispered and gossiped amongst themselves. But when Bhela approached, immediately they stopped and pretended nothing happened.</p>\n<p>“Young lady…” a pudgy aunty came to her, the one who stood up against the young elder from before.</p>\n<p>“Aunty?”</p>\n<p>“We are sorry… we’ve had no meaning to show you that embarrassing scene.”</p>\n<p>Bhela shook her head. “No, I’m one from the main family bloodline; I should've been the one who stood up to him instead of hiding behind everyone.”</p>\n<p>The aunty knew the young lady didn’t say a word before because the girl wanted to know the situation. Some other middle-aged aunties who were close with Madam Malikh also knew more or less Bhela’s detached wait-and-see attitude, so no one really would blame her even if she didn’t say a word before--especially since she had just returned from overseas. The pudgy aunty tugged on Bhela’s sleeve, whispered to her ear, “Young Lady Bhela, we know you’re concerned. But we’ve already gotten used to it. You’re still young. Your future is brighter than everyone else in the family, Young Lady Bhela. It’s better to endure than pointlessly making enemies.”</p>\n<p>“This isn’t pointless,” Bhela said. She then grabbed the nearest apron and wore it. Her father was the patriarch. And she wasn’t a poster girl to draw everyone’s attention to the family.</p>\n<p>The pudgy aunty wanted to say something again. But words stuck on her throat, she closed her mouth as soon as she opened it.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the old man began to pick some mature coconut and shredded it listlessly. He got more than four decades of handling food stalls for Malikh Family, he wasn’t a stranger at cooking rendang. But he already gave up on finishing one for tonight’s Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>“Uncle, I’ll take it from here,” Bhela said as she approached the weary old man.</p>\n<p>“Ahh, yes?” the old man was started. The girl came with an apron and common garment, had fair and beautiful skin, as well clear and articulate voice; a maidservant from the inner family was the first one that came to his mind. But only when he noticed even the aunties were respectful to her and her striking bob-cut short hair that the old man began drenched in cold sweat.</p>\n<p>“I said, uncle,” Bhela repeated, “I’ll take it from here. You can rest now.”</p>\n<p>The old man vigorously shook his head.</p>\n<p>“Please Young Lady Bhela… please spare this old bone….”</p>\n<p>“This is originally my father’s post, uncle. You’ll have to be at least an elder and write your name in council’s ledger to be a substitute for my father.”</p>\n<p>The old man wanted to break into a tearless cry. This is worse than when he faced Elder Jhamil’s son's harassment before. The most thing he was afraid of was the news of Elder Jhamil using him as Chief Chef behind the scene to reach the ears of the main family. And now that Bhela Malikh was here, there was nothing he could do but to resign his life to fate.</p>\n<p>“Y-young lady!” a maidservant yelled, “you can’t!”</p>\n<p>“Who says I can’t?” Bhela asked sharply.</p>\n<p>An aunty, who had a stern-looking face, said, “You can’t cook for the main course, young lady. In case of a patriarch's absence, usually one of the elders who’s going to take his place. There’s no rule saying it’s okay for women to do it.”</p>\n<p>“Then, I’m going to ask,” from the aunty, Bhela threw her glance toward the old man, “are you an elder cooking here to substitute my father as a cook, uncle?”</p>\n<p>The old man’s face turned pale. Whichever the answer of that question would lead him to the road of punishment. All of the sudden, he became a mute.</p>\n<p>Because she had the most standing, nobody made a sound when Young Lady Bhela Malikh asked them to fetch chickens and spices for her.</p>\n<p>Not long after, the story about how the Young Lady of Malikh Family wanted to substitute her father spread like a wildfire. Never in Badril Village’s history would a young lady do that. A crowd of curious males, mostly the youngsters from main and outer of Malikh Family, surrounded the kitchen as they wanted to catch a glimpse of how their beautiful young lady recklessly challenged the custom by her own. The boys sighed in admiration. Bhela Malikh was essentially an Archer at heart. But the way she handled a blade, even if it was a kitchen knife, was skillful and graceful, as every time her slim wrist stopped moving from cutting down a vegetable, a wave of gulping could be heard. The boys couldn’t take their eyes from her. The reckless and brave young lady was simply too charming.</p>\n<p>“Did you know that foreigners often confuse rendang as dried curry?” Bhela said to one maidservant who stared at the way she cooked. “Curry leaves originated from an area close to western Haldeen lands, so many local Mossacks sailed the sea to try their luck making it big working for western empires.”</p>\n<p>The usual aloof Bhela unusually was talkative when she was cooking, which was quite a big surprise for people who were watching. She explained to the clueless maidservants how, during her two years travelling in seminars from countries to countries, found many noble owned restaurants claimed to serve rendang but turned out to be dried curry. All the while sharply focused on doing her cooking duty.</p>\n<p>“Young lady!” from the crowd came out an angry bald man. He was Elder Jhamil. “W-what are you doing there?”</p>\n<p>“I’m cooking,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“But you can’t work there!” Elder Jhamil yelled. “No woman can substitute for patriarch! That’s against the rule!”</p>\n<p>“I don’t recall we have a rule like that.”</p>\n<p>“If you know why you still stand there?”</p>\n<p>“Neither do I recall a rule for an elder to use a stand-in for the Chief Chef position.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s face turned weird as if he suddenly got constipated. Many of the youngsters didn’t catch Bhela’s remarks nor they cared too much about it, but some in the crowd were nodding knowingly, as many of them were familiar with how shady Elder Jhamil was doing things.</p>\n<p>As the bald elder’s head was racing fast looking for an answer to defuse the young lady’s claim, suddenly, a loud roar exploded behind him.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela, who do you think you are? Just because your father is the family’s patriarch you think you can do whatever you want?!”</p>\n<p>The faces of aunties and the maidservants twitched. They witnessed how the young elder harassed the old man before, so they were itching to throw back the same question at him instead, though no more brave aunties dared to cause more troubles.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s son continued, “The ingredient for making Chief dishes takes money, young lady. Not even the patriarch himself has the daring to use coins from the treasury for himself. Do you want to embarrass your parents that much?”</p>\n<p>“I’m not making this food for myself nor I cook for my father. It’s for the guests. And I provided the spices and the foreign curry leaves by myself,” Bhela said. Some maidservants behind her nodded nervously as Bhela indeed ordered them to fetch spices from the personal kitchen in the main family’s residential area.</p>\n<p>In spite of that, the young elder kept pushing on with nasty smile on his face.</p>\n<p>“What about the chicken, young lady? They cost money! What do you say about that, huh?”</p>\n<p>Behind Bhela, the aunties, even the maidservants, were whispering at each other on how ridiculous it was to question the sole young generation of Malikh Family main bloodline over some chickens. Even Bhela, the young lady in question, would only glanced at the troubled expression of Elder Jhamil.</p>\n<p>“I will pay for the chicken,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Ha? Pay? With what? Your father’s money? Can’t a sick person even pay the cost of the foods for ngajen ceremony all by himself?”</p>\n<p>“No need to bring my father’s name here.” Bhela said with a dangerously cold tone.</p>\n<p>The chillness in her eyes was telling that she really did hate people bringing her parents’ name in bad faith. After hearing gasps of surprise from people that didn’t expect the usually silent young lady could utter something with such a biting tone, she sighed, said with an explanation, “I got a dress as a gift from a certain person who has too much money in his pocket. He said the dress is so valuable even the princesses wear them in parties. It should cover the cost of these chickens I’m going to cook if I sell the dress right here right now.”</p>\n<p>Bhela then tilted her head and glanced at the bald elder.</p>\n<p>“Am I right, Elder Jhamil?”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil wanted to maintain his smile, but his face went stiff as stone. He was trembling inside for knowing that the dress he acquired with a large sum of money and with his best connection, valued the same as some mere village chickens in Bhela’s eyes.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, his son, who was taken aback for a bit from the cold remark Bhela had said earlier, recovered, began to yell again, “Ha! Did you not train your brain when you were overseas, my young lady? The same dress princesses wear in parties? Only someone dumb believe that! Hah! Obviously you’ve been lied to! You’ve been crooked, young lady, crooked--”</p>\n<p><em>Paak!</em></p>\n<p>From behind, the already red-faced Elder Jhamil smacked his son’s head. “You’ve been rude to Young Lady Bhela, you dumbskull! You have to apologize! Young lady can’t bear to hear it anymore!”</p>\n<p>While in fact it was him who couldn’t bear to hear being called a crook.</p>\n<p>“Apologize!” Elder Jhamil roared.</p>\n<p><em>Splash!</em></p>\n<p>The pair father and son’s performance didn’t amuse Bhela, however. With the lid in her hand, Bhela scooped boiling curry broth and splashed it to their direction. Surprised, the stupid young elder swore with nasty words while his father cried in high-pitched voice.</p>\n<p>“Please get out,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil laughed wryly.</p>\n<p>“Please don’t be like that, young lady. I know my son doesn't have the best education but--”</p>\n<p><em>Splash!!</em></p>\n<p>Bhela waved the cooking lid once again as soon as Elder Jhamil stepped forward. The hot water splashed on his expensive boots. This time, while he didn’t expect for Bhela splashing hot water at him again, he wasn’t freaking out. It seemed his plan to make the young lady behave a little backfiring instead. His face turned solemn.</p>\n<p>“Young lady…”</p>\n<p>“I’m not going to say it thrice--everyone who has nothing to do in the kitchen, please get out,” Bhela said. “Or else--”</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The major families’ lands were astonishingly spacious and complex, their walls were thick and tall, therefore each of them employed a few stationary guards for the main gate as gatekeepers. These gatekeepers, though usually filled by members of the outer part of the families, their duty were significantly more important than others since they represented the face of the family they served. So they always maintain polite gestures to everyone who came through their gate, either commoners or rich people from big families. Yet when Shira and Mila arrived the Malikh Family’s gatekeepers didn’t even hide their scoffs.</p>\n<p>“Ridiculous!” she hissed with a face boiled in anger, “even lowly gatekeepers are looking down on us!”</p>\n<p>“Don’t bother with them,” Shira said. Unlike his cousin’s furious temper, his flair seemed like he shrugged the blatant disrespect, as the holder of “Eternal Novice” title he was already numb by how people were talking behind his back.</p>\n<p>“If your father was here they’d bow their asses as soon as they saw us Yashura coming.”</p>\n<p>Shira shrugged his shoulders again.</p>\n<p>Still seething in anger, Mila cast her eyes on the banana leaves wrapped food in Shira’s hands. “Who should we give the rendang to?” she asked.</p>\n<p>“Let’s just give it to a random servant.” Then Shira called a maidservant who was carrying a tray full of food. “Excuse me!”</p>\n<p>“Yes? What can I help y--” The moment this maidservant turned her head and saw Shira’s face, she immediately threw back her eyes and escaped with hurried trot, pretending she saw nothing.</p>\n<p>“The fuck?!” Mila was flastergabbed, didn’t know what to say.</p>\n<p>Later on Shira and Mila realized how unpopular Yashura Family was to the current Malikhs, even the servants who usually held no voice in the family were avoiding the pair of cousins like plague. Their attitude especially worsened when it came to Shira Yashura.</p>\n<p>“Look there,” someone whispered amongst the guests, “Yashura Family send their eldest young miss and the young master! Out of all the Ngajen Ceremony, they choose tonight to show their faces--pretty obvious, eh? Bet they’re drooling to get another Unique Class after knowing our Young Lady Bhela’s real talent tonight!”</p>\n<p>Someone else agreed and replied, “With that kind of trash as their young master, they’d be dreamin’ to get even a touch of our Young Lady Bhela. Pueh!”</p>\n<p>Hearing the muffled disdain, Mila Yashura whirled her body, glaring people with eagle eyes. “Who said that?!” she growled.</p>\n<p>“Mila…” Shira held her shoulder.</p>\n<p>“The fuckers don’t even put our Yashura Family in their eyes. Just because shitty rumors about Unique Class they started to feel high and mighty, eh?”</p>\n<p>“Just let go, Uncle Shuro didn’t send us here to start troubles,” Shira said. “All we need to do is to show our faces here and give them our rendang. It’s not our problem whether they welcome our good intention with grace or not.”</p>\n<p>Though Shira said that, he secretly hoped Malikh Family would grow too proud to receive it--all so he had an excuse to keep his uncle’s rendang for himself.</p>\n<p>A commotion arose. People hussing here and there with excitement. When Shira and Mila wanted to know what was going on, a parade of beautiful young women glittering and stealing the whole show came from inside of Malikh Family’s hall. Leading them was a short-haired young beauty, face as icy as an ice sculpture, the recent name that everyone had been talking about these days, Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>It was clear from the way Bhela positioned herself she represented the family as the ceremony’s Chief Chef.</p>\n<p>“Whoa, so Malikh Family let her do that,” Shira murmured.</p>\n<p>Not to mention being the Chief Chef--the most Shira did in his family’s kitchen was helping his uncle, helping him shred coconuts. They were at the same age, but the same old Shira still practiced butchering goats while the supposed fiancée of his was climbing the social ladder. Even Mila was angry by the special treatment Malikh Family gave to their young lady.</p>\n<p>“Sup, young master!” from behind a voice called him.</p>\n<p>Shira turned around, found the one who greeted him was Monkey.</p>\n<p>“Who?” Mila asked Shira as the stranger with a monkey-like face approaching.</p>\n<p>“This one is called by the name of Monkey, young lady,” Monkey, with his self-trained Mossack’s style bowing gesture, introduced himself smoothly.</p>\n<p>Mila hummed in ackwnoledgement. It was harder to forget than remembering someone with such combination of face and awkward name.</p>\n<p>“Mister Monkey, I thought you’ll spend the ceremony to show Mister Snake around since he’s an outsider. What are you doing in Malikh Family?” Shira asked.</p>\n<p>“Now, now, please drop the ‘Mister’, young master. I’m not that old yet to be called as such,” Monkey said, then he continued explaining his story this evening. “We were planning to go to your family’s ceremony, young master. But who would have thought Snake to meet with his relatives here? His relatives are actually Malikh Family’s guests for tonight’s Ngajen Ceremony. Bet he got to eat expensive cuisines right now.”</p>\n<p>“Well, it’ll be easier with Mister Snake here. I’ve got some coins I want to show you, I wonder if it works to use them for--” Shira sneakily glanced at his cousin, then turned back to Monkey like it was nothing, “--for the thing we talked about yesterday.”</p>\n<p>Mila sneered, “You have some business to attend, no?”</p>\n<p>“Not really, no,” Shira shrugged off her question.</p>\n<p>“Really, though?” Mila crossed her arms, sneered again. “I think I saw Romana just now. I’mma chat with her a little bit.”</p>\n<p>It seemed to Shira that his cousin meeting with Romana here, in Malikh Family’s Ngajen Ceremony, wasn’t simply to have fun. He didn’t like his cousin would make trouble but he didn’t want to spend the whole night with her either. “Don’t go home without me,” he said eventually.</p>\n<p>“Hmph! You’re not a kid anymore but still need me to accompany you home?”</p>\n<p>No, Shira actually was more worried about her than himself.</p>\n<p>He then glanced beside and said, “Mister Monkey.”</p>\n<p>“Just Monkey,” Monkey corrected.</p>\n<p>“Mister Just Monkey, you said Mister Snake with relative? And his relatives are Malikh Family’s guests?”</p>\n<p>“Not Just Mon--ah, forget about it,” Monkey already gave up guessing whether Young Master Shira Yashura was purposely pulling his leg or not. “They really were Malikh Family’s guests, they even got the front row for the prayer and all.”</p>\n<p>“Is hard for us to be friendly if Mister Snake is involved with Malikh Family.”</p>\n<p>“You mean, that, huh? Well, I’ve been here for a while and they talked about you a lot, so I guess even someone as chill as you can get angry sometimes. But you don’t have to worry about those Malikhs, Young Master Shira. As long as their patriarch is Ghalim Malikh they won’t sever ties with Yashura so easily.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, is this your opinion?”</p>\n<p>“It’s Snake’s. It’s what he said before he met his relatives.”</p>\n<p>Shira thought the Alchemist he met once before was a total stranger of Badril Village, but it appeared he was wrong. “He really does know about Malikh Family that much, doesn’t he?”</p>\n<p>“Well, yeah, but I think he’s more familiar with Yashura than Malikh Family, though,” Monkey said, crossing his arms and nodded to himself as he recalled things that Snake told him to get his wares supported by Yashura Family; for example, obtaining Butler Yulong’s permission the same as Patriarch Shuro Yashura’s, Snake once said.</p>\n<p>“What? Why do you make that kind of face, Young Master Shira?” Monkey was snapped from his train of thought.</p>\n<p>“Ah, no, I just don’t expect you’re going to say some like that.”</p>\n<p>“What are you saying, young master. In the first place, Snake became my crew because he heard I’ve some dealing with Yashura Family.”</p>\n<p>Shira did recall the first time Monkey contacted Yashura Family--through him. To be more exact, the first item Monkey dealt from Malikh Family was Shira’s smuggled erotic painting that Good-Natured Spirit rejected.</p>\n<p>“--Speaking of Snake,” with his thumb Monkey did point in a certain direction. The place was separated from the common guest as they indeed were Malikh Family’s special guests. Shira’s eyes followed and he saw the familiar Alchemist he knew not long ago, Snake, was talking with two men, young and old, most likely brother and his grandfather.</p>\n<p>“Don’t be fooled by their appearances, young master. They’re renowned experts,” Monkey said.</p>\n<p>The pair of brother and grandfather wore worn out pale robes as their clothes, unlike the image of revered experts in Shira’s mind. Monkey told him both likely to travel incognito for various reasons. The old man had an old white hair and long beard, his back crooked and had to bring a walking staff to support himself, and gave people the impression of a sleepy grandpa from the dim light on his eyes. The young one though, had an always angry-looking face with fierce brows, crossing his muscle-thick arms, locked in a debate with Snake. Snake’s face was notably paler than when Shira met him in the market.</p>\n<p>“We can’t greet Mister Snake now, can we?” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“I don’t think we can,” Monkey said. Even though he long considered Snake as his partner, the two guests appearing incognito were still the main members of the revered Alchemist family. This was no time for commoners like him acting friendly on them all of the sudden.</p>\n<p>The sleepy-looking old man, noticing two pairs of eyes looking at him, he raised his head. He caught the sight of Shira. Their eyes met.</p>\n<p>“Oh ho,” the old man smiled when he found the boy. He dragged his old body to approach the flastergabbed Shira and Monkey.</p>\n<p>Even Monkey who knew more about them wouldn’t expect Snake’s relatives to introduce themselves first.</p>\n<p>“He’s heading this way…”</p>\n<p>“Ah, yes, apparently.”</p>\n<p>Monkey gulped. “It’s different with Snake. Although he looked like that, whatever you do, please, young master, you can’t afford to be rude in front of this elder…”</p>\n<p>From the nervousness in Monkey’s voice Shira found the approaching old man seemed to hail from a more prestigious family than he originally thought.</p>\n<p>“Greeting, elder,” Shira said with his head humbly lowered as soon as he approached.</p>\n<p>The old man chuckled, patted Shira’s head, said, “Ah, Young Master, look how much you’ve grown. It feels like only yesterday how happy you were running around like a little kid you are.”</p>\n<p>Shira nodded hearing that. He glanced beside him, and caught Monkey’s face flabbergasted looking both at the boy and the old man.</p>\n<p>Hiding his embarrassment behind a fake cough, Shira then tried to understand whether the old man mistook him for someone else. “I’m sorry, elder. I don’t know if I’m mistaken, but, have we met before?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, have we met? Of course we’ve--” he stopped. The old man's eyes were covered by a pair of soft hands of a girl.</p>\n<p>“Guess who this is?” the girl who sneakily teased the old man from behind was grinning.</p>\n<p>“Oho! Who is this? Who is this?” the old man smiled delightedly.</p>\n<p>Both Shira and Monkey were tense watching the scene before them. Especially Shira Yashura, who knew that the grin on his cousin’s face always told that the girl enjoyed herself a little bit too much.</p>\n<p>“Isn’t this… Tomboy Princess?” the old man guessed.</p>\n<p>“Tuut! Wrong!”</p>\n<p>Mila released her hands. When the old man turned to see the preparator, he exclaimed with a chuckle.</p>\n<p>“It’s really you, Tomboy Princess.”</p>\n<p>Mila excitedly echoed, “It’s really you, Grandpa Piss!”</p>\n<p>They were so glad they met after a long time that they started to hug each other. Then Mila pull herself from the oldman’s embrace, yelling, “Ugghh…” she pinched her nose, “I smell something pissy around here.”</p>\n<p>Just when Shira and Monkey wondered what Mila meant by that, the girl looked at the old man, saying, “It’s no wonder it smells pissy. Have you taken a bath, Grandpa Piss.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss answered with a laugh. But Shira and Monkey facepalmed.</p>\n<p>So much for being mindful in front of the revered old expert.</p>\n<p>Shira awkwardly smiled to cover his shame. “Mila, you should be mindful in front of elders.”</p>\n<p>“Mindful?” Mila gasped. “In front of Grandpa Piss? Why?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, it’s okay, young master,” the old man said as he waved his hand. “I’m not that old to lose my sense of humor. Yashura Family’s princess sure is as naughty as always.” His wrinkles deepened as he curled his lips into a big smile. He said to Mila, “I reckon Patriarch Shuro’s been well, my princess? I recall he got a lot of migraines back in the day.”</p>\n<p>Haughtily, Mila replied, “Don’t worry about that guy, Grandpa Piss. His brain capacity has been declining these past years so there’s really nothing left inside to give him any headache!”</p>\n<p>“Ehem,” Shira cleared his phlegm. “She meant our patriarch has been well, elder.”</p>\n<p>“That’s what I said,” Mila laughed, and the old man laughed too. After that Mila kissed Grandpa Piss’s right hand as if she was kissing an elder’s hand from her own family, then continued laughing as cheeky as always.</p>\n<p>“My naughty princess,” Grandpa Piss ruffled Mila’s hair, “I planned to visit Yashura Family later. But since we’ve already met, here, please take this.”</p>\n<p>Receiving a pack wrapped in dried leaves, Mila pouted her lips. “You wouldn’t be lying about this being a candy again, would you?”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, of course not.”</p>\n<p>As far as her memory served her well, what Grandpa Piss called candy actually a really bitter herb for young children to gain their appetite. Mila sniffed. She opened it and have a little taste. “Uuueeekk!”</p>\n<p>It was sour and even more bitter than she remembered. “What the hell is this?!”</p>\n<p>“That herb’s not for consumption, Young Lady Mila” the big man with muscles, Snake’s big brother, said from behind Grandpa Piss. He was smiling politely despite the other party merely a young lady of a rural village. “It’s a cosmetic for skin care.”</p>\n<p>“Skin care?!”</p>\n<p>Mila’s mouth widened agape. But soon as she glanced at the muscle man who was approaching her, she became wary, leaned to Grandpa Piss and whispered, “Grandpa Piss, who’s that?”</p>\n<p>With a patient smile replied, Grandpa Piss said, “He’s Snotty. Don’t you remember Snotty?”</p>\n<p>Mila was surprised. “Oooohh! Snotty! You’ve turned into a real man now I can’t even recognize you anymore!”</p>\n<p>“Haha… you’re surely jest young lady,” Snotty said.</p>\n<p>“No, really…” with fingers on her chin, eyes on muscles, Mila added, “you really transformed into something new, Snotty. I’m impressed. You were so skinny and really a snotty boy back then.”</p>\n<p>The man continued to laugh. The atmosphere was friendly and harmless. Yet Monkey, who had long heard Snotty’s real identity and preceding reputation from Snake’s mouth, began sweating profusely.</p>\n<p>Mila really loved gifted cosmetics and the like. After knowing how effective it was for her beauty, she shamelessly asked, “Can I ask for more, Grandpa Piss? I have a good friend who needs to be a beauty--as soon as possible!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, of course I have more--here, take this,” Grandpa Piss took out another one.</p>\n<p>“Waow!” Mila’s eyes sparkled in a weird glint. Shira, who saw that, knew his cousin’s greed began to surface; suddenly the unruly young lady acted as if she was a timid maiden. “Grandpa Piss… I think my other friend needs it too…” she asked sweetly.</p>\n<p>“Hohoh!” Grandpa Piss stroked his beard again. “Unfortunately, my princess, I’ve got only three pack and I planned to give the last one for Young Lady Malikh.”</p>\n<p>Hearing a certain short-haired girl being mentioned, the shy maiden’s face twisted in an ugly sour face, returned back to her original color. “Tch.”</p>\n<p>“Hey, don’t click your tongue in front of elders,” Shira warned her.</p>\n<p>“Tch.” Mila crossed her arms and threw away her pouting face.</p>\n<p>Shira was always frustrated whenever a younger one like him would be the one to reprimand ethics into this blockhead of a girl.</p>\n<p>“Now, now, young lady. Please remember Grandpa’s already too old to concoct too many cosmetics--getting two packs already good enough,” Snotty said.</p>\n<p>Snake looked at the leaves wrapped cosmetics in Mila’s hands and exclaimed, “Grandfather concocted them himself?”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss nodded with an amiable smile. “Of course. Been twelve years since the last time I was here. It’d be embarrassing if I came with half-hearted gifts, don’t you think so?”</p>\n<hr>\n<novel-trivia>\n<p>The nickname of “Grandpa Piss” stuck on Grandmaster Alchemist’s name for twelve years. When a friend of his asked the origin of this horrible nickname, the Grandmaster laughed it off and said a princess of his old friend’s family started calling him that, because her cousin who was still a three years old brat urinated on him every time the Grandmaster tried to hug him.</p>\n<p>Legend said that the princess was also calling the heir of Grandmaster Alchemist’s family with the nickname of “Snotty”. But even to this day, nobody knows which kingdom this cheeky princess comes from.</p>\n</novel-trivia>\n","volume-6/chapter-4-5":"<p>Badril Village, though had been two years passed without her presence, was the same as always for Bhela Malikh. She hadn’t that many acquaintances her age she could consider friendly before. In spite of that, from the day she returned, people act as if they were her rekindled childhood friends she never knew she had.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” a daughter of an elder from Elzhier Family asked curiously, “is the rumor about that story true?”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at her with eyelids half-closed.</p>\n<p>“Which rumor?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, silly you, of course <em>that</em> rumor! The one about your romance with a blue blood noble!”</p>\n<p>Giggles of girls followed after the girl’s words. When Bhela returned to Badril Village she brought not only fame and reputation, but interesting stories and rumors as well. She was currently surrounded by curious young ladies who sought for exciting gossip.</p>\n<p>“Yeah, yeah!” another girl excitedly hussing in low voice. “I heard he’ll attend Malikh’s ngajen ceremony tonight!”</p>\n<p>“Really?”</p>\n<p>“Why else would Young Lady Bhela take the Chef Chief position if she didn’t expect for her lover to come tonight? He’ll come for sure!”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, yeah, everybody is saying Young Lady Bhela doing just for that!”</p>\n<p>Bhela found it was amazing how people could conjure their own rumors despite not seeing the true story by their own eyes.</p>\n<p>And just when the young ladies started getting excited discussing Young Lady Bhela’s ‘love life’, a vigorous shout resounded the courtyard announcing that Blackwood Family had arrived.</p>\n<p>“Blackwood Family?” someone cocked their head and looked over the direction of the gate. “What kind of family is so bold announcing their names in other family’s ngajen ceremony? Not even Village Head’s Elzhier Family would do to the ceremony host!”</p>\n<p>“Only foreigners to be that stupid to be rude in big family like Malikh! If this is my place I’d send a guard to kick their ass out as soon as possible!”</p>\n<p>“Look over there! Malikh Family elders are rushing to the gate! Let’s check out how’s Malikhs going to deal with it!”</p>\n<p>Curious guests were tailing the elders to see some commotion they thought would occur. However, not only did the Malikhs not make a fuss over it, they even bowed their heads toward the newly arrived noble as if they were servants greeting their returning master. Young people were overly excited because nobles were foreign and appeared in stories all of their lives.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Mila, who already went back with her friend, was gritting teeth with anger. Beside her Romana was holding the tomboy back, though concerned she didn't say a word.</p>\n<p>“Why should I am the one who always had to hold myself back?” Mila hissed in a low voice as if she was wronged.</p>\n<p>“Look around and think about who’s receiving the blow the most. Everyone’s talking about your cousin right now--do you want to make it worse for him?”</p>\n<p>After hearing her friend’s warning, Mila began to take a deep breath and think things through. Romana was right. When she opened her ears Mila could hear people comparing the young master of this noble Blackwood Family with her cousin Shira. They compared such a gallant-looking young noble with a trash of Yashura Family young master, adding with their own biased seasoning here and there, making her cousin Shira look really bad. Mila trembled as her face boiled red from holding back her anger.</p>\n<p>“Where’s Shira right now?”</p>\n<p>“I think he went hiding!” Romana said.</p>\n<p>“Hiding?! He’s embarrassed to show his face that much?”</p>\n<p>After circling around a bit, Mila found the boy’s silhouette in the shadow far from the braziers' light. There, he was squatting, hiding along with two other silhouettes who were also squatting in a suspicious manner.</p>\n<p>“Now, young master, where the hell did you get this coin?” someone whispered from the suspicious bunch.</p>\n<p>The reply came also in the same hushed manner. “Don’t ask me now, just know I’ve got a few more hidden in my house. I can’t move my family, but if you’re fine with this, I can invest in your goods earlier.”</p>\n<p>“We’re fine? Of course we’re fine! Don’t you know how amazing this coin is?”</p>\n<p>“It’s amazing? I can’t even buy satays with this. Nobody here would receive unfamiliar currency.”</p>\n<p>“But don’t you know how far ahead you can go if merchants know you grab some of these coins?”</p>\n<p>“You tell me.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, these coins weren’t issued by any countries, but they’re valuable. Lots of herbs and ingredients in the black markets can only be bought with these coins...”</p>\n<p><em>...whisper whisper whisper...</em></p>\n<p>Mila approached.</p>\n<p>“Ey, what are you doing?!”</p>\n<p>For some reasons, Shira and Monkey, one of his companions, almost jumped in fright by her barking. Both Mila and Romana behind her saw Shira and Monkey were acting suspicious--but Sneak, the third silhouette, didn’t even try to hide that he was nibbling on something delicious.</p>\n<p>Mila, with a weird face, hissed, “Is that… <em>rendang</em> you guys were eating?”</p>\n<p>“<em>Cough, cough,</em>” hiding the opened wrapping banana leaves, Shira awkwardly trying to make an excuse, “I think Malikh Family is too eager to cut off relationships with our Yashura Family so… I reckon they don’t need this anymore…”</p>\n<p>Mila was so angry she slapped the banana leaves in Shira’s hand.</p>\n<p>“Ah, my rendang…”</p>\n<p>“Your rendang?! You goddamn moron!” Mila hissed, she didn’t dare to roar and announce themselves to other guests. “You’re about to get cuckolded and all you think about is a goddamn rendang?!”</p>\n<p>“Young master, someone trying to get you cuckolded?” licking his fingers for some leftover rendang sauce, Snake asked from the side.</p>\n<p>Shira shook his head. “Cuckold is a very strong word. That girl didn’t even consider me from the beginning. It’s not like we're a married couple yet.”</p>\n<p>He then came to pick the spoiled beef and mourned, “ah… my poor rendang.”</p>\n<p>“Stop crying over that shit! It’s not important!”</p>\n<p>Monkey blurted, “Rendang is not important?”</p>\n<p>Mila glared at Monkey. The monkey-faced peddler closed his mouth as soon as he opened it.</p>\n<p>Romana saw her friend Mila had a bad affinity with her cousin whenever she was angry, thus came to explain from the side, “Young Master Shira, don’t you know people outside the Mossack culture do take engagement seriously? It’s understandable for a young heir of a conservative family like Yashura to not care much about it--but, whatever your feelings regarding your engagement is, if Young Lady Bhela has an affair outside, she’ll also drag down Yashura Family’s reputation. So please be mindful about it more for the sake of your family.”</p>\n<p>They didn’t really think about this deeply since straightforward Mossack people were the type to have children before they were even married. If things went awry, Shira reckoned his uncle and the elders in his family might think the engagement matter was similar to puppy love, about children bantering, but the young generation who was exposed to stories and gossips from books and travellers might think about it differently. And someone who didn’t hang out so much like Shira wouldn’t be able to tell how these youngsters would talk about this incident in the future.</p>\n<p>So Shira stood up and patted his trouser, admitted, “Ah, you’re right, Romana.”</p>\n<p>Mila crossed her arms. Frowning at her cousin. “What are you gonna do now? Fight them? No need to be afraid, I’m with you.”</p>\n<p>Snake, still squatting comfortably, added, “Young Master, my grandfather and my older brother are still here too. You won’t be at a disadvantage in case things go downhill.”</p>\n<p>“It’s decided. Let’s kick their asses!” Mila growled.</p>\n<p>“The heck are you talking about kicking people’s asses in Ngajen Ceremony?” Shira grunted.</p>\n<p>“Then at least let me slap that slut’s arrogant face!”</p>\n<p>Shira shook his head.</p>\n<p>“Let’s go,” he said.</p>\n<p>“We’re gonna slap her face now?” Mila asked.</p>\n<p>“No. We at least have to make Family Yashura’s presence known here,” Shira said. He caught his companions’ confused expressions, so he added, “Everyone is getting excited because most of them are young'uns. But if this incident gets out of the hands, the elders from other families won’t be silent about it.”</p>\n<p>Mila wanted to say something but didn’t after seeing Shira’s relaxed face. She didn’t want to say something silly that’d change the boy’s mind. Therefore, with Shira leading the way, she and her friend Romana went to see the ruckus caused by the noble’s arrival. Leaving Monkey and Sneak who were silent looking at their back.</p>\n<p>The two exchanged glances.</p>\n<p>They looked down, eyes sweeping the ground.</p>\n<p>“Mm?” Monkey mumbled, his hands crawling all over the dirt.</p>\n<p>Snake took out a magic wand. The wand shimmered with a gentle light, then he used that to give some light to the ground where the rendang was spoiled.</p>\n<p>But it was Monkey who shouted in joy, “I got one!”</p>\n<p>“Give me that!” Snake pounced the moment he saw Monkey rubbed the dirt of a piece of rendang.</p>\n<p>Pushing out Snake’s face from grabbing the rendang in his hand, Monkey felt wronged and cried, “Why would a rich gentleman like you fight over a single beef with this poor peddler? Don’t you know my family can only afford to eat beef once a year?”</p>\n<p>“Why, you asked?” Snake sneered, “There’s no need to say the obvious. You don’t get to eat Patriarch Shuro’s handmade rendang everyday! And I’m saying this after starving for beef ever since I’m following you.”</p>\n<p>“Fuck off!”</p>\n<p>“Give me that!”</p>\n<p>“No!”</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the shadowy corner where they were wrestling came to be lightened up with a lit torch.</p>\n<p>“Ehem, you two gentlemen,” a voice called.</p>\n<p>For a moment, Monkey and Snake stopped fighting.</p>\n<p>The voice owner was a man with Malikh Family’s servant uniform. Reluctantly, he continued, “Badril Village locals are usually open-minded and tolerant people. However, we have a bottom line. If you two couldn’t hold it you should rent some inn room or do it in the bushes! Don’t do it in the open, you’re making people uncomfortable! Know some shame!”</p>\n<p>Monkey at first didn’t get what the servant was talking about. Then he realized during infighting over the rendang, he had opened his legs, and Snake was on top of him in a very, very awkward manner.</p>\n<p>“Dammit!” he kicked Snake and trembling over the horror he caught himself in. But suddenly he noticed the rendang in his hand already vanished. He whirled his head around. Snake was already licking his fingers with a satisfied face.</p>\n<p>“Dammit!” Monkey howled again.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The one who enthusiastically greeted the young noble of Blackwood Family was Elder Jhamil instead of Bhela Malikh. He managed to conjure thirty years worth of bullshitting skills to flatter and fawn over the other party, rather thick faced to continue despite the young master of noble family rolled his eyes several times. As soon as the young noble caught the sight of a short-haired girl he immediately escaped from Elder Jhamil’s clutch with a big grin on his face.</p>\n<p>“Ah, Sister Bhela!”</p>\n<p>“Young Master Frane Blackwood.”</p>\n<p>“How are you doing Young Lady Bhela? Fancy to meet you again,” he said as he gifted the girl a flower.</p>\n<p>Bhela received the flower but then immediately passed it to a random maidservant beside her. She said as if it was nothing, “I’m fine. Thank you.”</p>\n<p>Young Master Frane Blackwood smiled wryly. “I’ve been travelling with hardly any rest so that I can see you sooner, my young lady,” the young master of Blackwood Family, Frane Blackwood, said, “may I be so lucky to receive your company tonight?”</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry, but here the words ‘tonight’s companion’ have different meanings than when you say it in the western-style ball--so, no, Young Master Blackwood, I can’t give you company tonight,” she said.</p>\n<p>The young noble still had a smile and wanted to correct his wording, but Bhela suddenly raised her hand and said, “Excuse me.”</p>\n<p>She went past him and greeted another pair of guests instead.</p>\n<p>“Greeting, sir, madam.”</p>\n<p>“It’s about time,” the middle-aged man didn’t answer Bhela’s greeting, but complained instead. “You know the other families had begun their ceremonies, right? Even though we don’t have the same ceremony as your Ngajen Ceremony from the place where I come from, but I know those who don’t take any old ceremonies seriously only brought bad luck over their lands.”</p>\n<p>There was a rare restraint in Bhela’s voice as she replied, “I apologize for our bad conduct, Sir Instructor. I will request the elders to proceed with the ceremony. Please let me lead you toward the reserved spot I previously prepared for both of you.”</p>\n<p>“Lead the way then.”</p>\n<p>Badril Village locals witnessed the valiant Young Lady of Malikh Family taking charge of the Ngajen Ceremony as the Chief Chef, but with the appearance of her bowing to two unfamiliar guests as well, whispers were floating amongst the Ngajen Ceremony guests. Before long, everyone knew that two guests Bhela Malikh greeted were the ones she personally invited, but was neglected before the family’s gate because of the excitement made by the noble’s arrival. Bhela came to them to apologize in person.</p>\n<p>Young Master Frane Blackwood, who felt ignored, pulled a self-decrepitating sneer. He complained to Elder Jhamil instead, “Oh, Malikh Family elder, can you tell me the identity of those two guests who made even Young Lady Bhela to bow her head?”</p>\n<p>“Ehem, ehem,” Elder Jhamil didn’t know what to answer, so he concocted a reply out of thin air, “I think they were relatives from her maternal family.”</p>\n<p>“Is that so? From the way they are dressed, they don’t look from that respectable background enough to get the young lady’s full attention. Don’t you think so?”</p>\n<p>“Young noble is right. Young Lady Bhela’s father once was a gangster thus he didn’t manage to teach common sense to the young lady. I’ll talk to her later to explain what’s really important.”</p>\n<p>After a bit of excuse and fawning, Young Master Blackwood felt this Elder Jhamil was acceptable. He told the Blackwood Family’s servants to bring the gifts he had prepared, which were naturally accepted by Elder Jhamil on the young lady’s behalf. In the meantime, people were disappointed that the drama they were expecting didn’t happen. But what could they do besides shaking their heads and disperse?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Year after year, the ngajen ceremony evolved from stiff sessions of praying ceremony for village safety to the new stylish festivities of foods and happy times for the youngsters, where fads and trends emerge. However big their way of life was changing the conservative major families, Yashura and Elzhier, still pretty much followed the old ways, especially when it came to the prayers. Only Malikh Family amongst the three that eager to embrace the new world that was coming. And by Elder Jhamil’s direction, instead of local shamans, Malikh Family asked help from foreign priests from western orthodox temples from nearby villages to lead the prayer.</p>\n<p>It was all good if one made a progressive decision with the greater good in mind. But here was the problem; orthodox temple priests usually led prayers for abundant harvest, while Ngajen Ceremony was all about calming Selaqs from descending the mountain. These priests probably hadn’t any clue how Selaqs looked like.</p>\n<p>“It was inappropriate for a noble to pray to old Mossack deities they don’t believe in, that was Malikhs’ excuses,'' Mila complained non-stop since they finished praying with other guests. In her hands--like a young mother hugging her baby--were plates of food she had just plundered from Malikh Family’s banquet tables prepared to entertain guests.</p>\n<p>“What deity? Wasn’t the mantra replaced from ancient Mossack prayers to magic spell mantra to calm down Selaq since… I don’t know, fifty years ago?” Romana said. The food in her hands was no less than Mila’s. These two girls seemed to think Malikh Family would regret offending them if they plunder the latter’s prepared feast like no tomorrow.</p>\n<p>“That's what I was saying! We no longer those ancient Mossacks who would sacrifice relatives so Selaqs won’t come down the mountain! Nowadays we’ve been using legit spells to keep all those Selaqs away, and these stupid Malikhs want to change the tradition just to appease some visiting noble? They’d rather avoid their noble guest to be uncomfortable than preventing Selaqs from coming down to chew their stupid brains, hah!”</p>\n<p>Compared to noisy girls beside him, Shira was able to keep his head to his feet. Romana signaled Mila with her eyes when she realized the boy wasn’t so into retaliating against the Malikhs; instead of invading the feast Shira, grabbed Malikh Family’s snacks moderately whenever he could--just like any other normal guests that came here.</p>\n<p>Mila grumbled with a bad mood, faced Shira and said, “Don’t you have something you need to do?”</p>\n<p>“Like what?” Shira hoped this cheeky cousin of his wouldn’t say something about kicking people’s asses again.</p>\n<p>“We can’t wait for something to happen,” she said. “Go ask that bitc--I mean, that fiancée of yours--go ask for a dance. The young’uns are starting to get heated. Look there, one of them couples are dancing. You go join them since that short-haired cunt is your fiancée after all.”</p>\n<p>Mila glanced around for a while before she realized she just had her tongue slipped. She quickly corrected her previous words, “Did I say cunt? I mean short-haired bitch--no, short-haired <em>young lady</em>.”</p>\n<p>“Why don’t you just be honest with yourself here. People have been calling Malikhs much worse here because the foreign priests matter!” Romana laughed.</p>\n<p>At that moment a very young maidservant of Malikh Family just passed by and overheard their conversation. The little maidservant snorted in anger, which made Mila snorted back as a retort.</p>\n<p>“Go, go! Go dance with her!” Mila whispered when she was sure only Shira and Romana were around.</p>\n<p>Shira clicked his tongue. “I don’t even have a single proper conversation with her these past ten years. Why should I go ask her dance out of the blue? Just showing our face around here is enough.”</p>\n<p>“Fool! If she accepted to dance with you then all is good, that would only confirm Malikh Family’s cocky attitude is only because their dipshit brains are getting fried by their own inflated proud ego, nothing serious! But if she ignores you in front of others… heh--she dares!”</p>\n<p>“That’s easy for you to say. If someone you don’t like suddenly asks your hands for a dance, what would you feel later on when you found out refusing means two families become enemies?”</p>\n<p>“Uh-uh, I don’t feel nothing. If he’s my fiancé then it’s my job to go my way out to make it clear in public! Going dancing, going kissing, like a proper damned couple! That’s what the goddamn engagement is all about! Right?”</p>\n<p>Mila ate a cookie and she blinked. Unsure of the previous words she said, she glanced at Romana and murmured, “...right?”</p>\n<p>Romana shrugged.</p>\n<p>But Shira wouldn’t back down easily. He continued arguing, “What if your fiancé is Bony Elzhier, then? Are you going to kiss him to prove he’s your fiancé?”</p>\n<p>Mila hid her gasp.</p>\n<p>“You wanna die?” she pursed her lips. “Listen to me or I’m gonna smack your face!”</p>\n<p>Shira groaned against his cousin’s unreasonableness. But before he could concoct a satisfying retort, Snake and Monkey came out of nowhere.</p>\n<p>“Oh, Young Master Shira,” Monkey came patting him on the shoulder, “it seems you get cuckolded for real this time.”</p>\n<p>People were clapping and whistling as the flashy Young Master Frane Blackwood led Young Lady Bhela Malikh by the hand.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Malikh was entertaining two guests previously, but that bald elder raised a fuss about how she neglected the young noble, so in the end it came to this.”</p>\n<p>Monkey laughed as he teased Shira with his elbow, “They’re going to dance. When two people were dancing in Ngajen Ceremony, that meant they--” he caught the scary experssion on Mila’s face, stopped, “nevermind…”</p>\n<p>“That slut!” Mila hissed.</p>\n<p>This was getting serious. Whenever Mila showed that kind of face something bad would happen. Again, the moment Shira opened his mouth to say something, someone else came to grab him in the shoulder.</p>\n<p>“Brat, your woman is going to cuckold you in public,” said the newcomer, Good-Natured Spirit, who literally came out of the thin air.</p>\n<p>“You too?”</p>\n<p>Shira had a headache. Both Monkey and Snake couldn’t see the annoying Good-Natured Spirit, but the three of them were in harmony in mocking him. They mocked him to the point saying he wouldn’t care would only embarrass him further.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, being led by the hand, Bhela Malikh asked Young Master Blackwood, “What kind of remedy Blackwood Family brought with you?”</p>\n<p>“Why so much in hurry, my young lady?” the young noble gave a laugh and a flash of smile. “No need to worry, Blackwood Family sympathize with the disaster that befell your father, so my mother send me here to personally deliver the medicine Blackwood House had sought far and wide.”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh said nothing more. The Young Master of Blackwood Family pondered as he read the cold expression of the girl, thinking that even with flowers and jewelry gifts, nothing could move this young lady. Such a waste of that beautiful face to not letting a single smile escaped, Young Master Blackwood could only smacked his lips and shook his head. But as soon as he mentioned a medicine he brought for her father, the feisty young lady became amiable almost immediately.</p>\n<p>Good thing for him. Bhela Malikh was talented, the Blackwood Family planned to have her inside their house, and if things went this smoothly he could do that his mother told him sooner than he expected.</p>\n<p>“Little bitch of Malikh Family,” a girl roared, “you finally show your true color you bitch! Is Yashura Family a joke to you?!”</p>\n<p>The furious Mila Yashura became the center of attention. She snorted as she strode, like an angry bull preparing to charge, with the mood that would make the crowd wordlessly give way to her. Not only because they didn’t want anything to do with the infamous young lady of Yashura Family--who, when angry, once punched Bony in the face with a nosebleed--but also because she got a sword in her hands.</p>\n<p>Shira glanced down. His father’s sword he brought with him was gone. He looked again at the unsheated weapon in his cousin’s hands.</p>\n<p>He could only slap his own face the moment he noticed what was happened.</p>\n<p>Mila took a step forward slowly, but her face turned even fiercer. She spoke, “You got guts to bring a lover from outside, eh? I knew something fishy happened when I saw you cut your hair, you little slut.”</p>\n<p>“I cut my hair because it got in the way during my training,” Bhela replied plainly. “And this is not my lover. Just a relative of my friend.”</p>\n<p>“You lying little slut. As if someone like you have any friends!”</p>\n<p>“I do have a friend.” Bhela said. A rare emphasizing tone in her voice was telling that she was upset, but she held back from explaining further.</p>\n<p>“I don’t care what your excuse is! Do you think I don’t know what you shitty Malikhs up to? You already don’t put Yashura Family in your eyes, eh? Just because you bitch have a little vacation outside, eh? If you think you’re a big shot, why don’t you prove it here and now?!”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh was silent for a while. Looking at Mila, she then asked, “And what are you suggesting I should do, Young Lady Yashura?”</p>\n<p>Mila stabbed her sword into the ground.</p>\n<p>“I just want to know how awesome is this Archer class you’ve got overseas that makes you Malikhs stop putting us Yashuras in your eyes,” Mila sneered. “Why don’t we test it with my sword, eh? Let’s do a duel, bitch.”</p>\n<p>Bhela just looked at Mila strangely.</p>\n<p>“But you’re a Specialist class,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Aha! Getting scared, aren’t ya, you little cunt?”</p>\n<p>Bhela didn’t want to argue with her. So she told the nearest servant to go grab a bow.</p>\n<p>On the other side, Monkey anxiously elbowed Shira, said, “Should I drag your cousin back?”</p>\n<p>“Stand down, mister. Mila is the one who’s starting it. She can’t afford to back down now.”</p>\n<p>Beside them Snake was nodding as he understood what Shira meant.</p>\n<p>Then with a laugh, Good-Natured Spirit, who was already tired jeering him, said to Shira. “Kid, shit just got real. Ain’t that a good idea to pull her before it’s too late?”</p>\n<p>Shira wanted to but he couldn’t. He knew exactly Mila’s strength. Fighting bare hands, she might get a chance to stand against the strongest youngster in the village, but it would become a different story when weapons and mana were involved.</p>\n<p>Since Mila was the one to propose the duel, bailing out before the fight began would be slapping her own face in front of the guests. It was a bad idea, because Mila didn’t appear to have the slightest chance to win. So bad that it’d be more reasonable to just surrender. But Shira knew Mila hated to go back on her words the most. Thus he silently moved closer to her, prepared to pull her back in before the situation really got out of his hands.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Young Master Blackwood, was pulled out by an adjutant of his family.</p>\n<p>Smirking, he asked the adjutant, “Who is that girl who picking a fight with Bhela?”</p>\n<p>“Seems like the eldest young lady of that family,” the adjutant replied.</p>\n<p>“You mean the family my Bhela got engaged to?” Young Master Frane Blackwood asked as if Bhela already his. The corner of his lips curled as he thought this might be a good chance to do something on the engagement that Blackwood House already saw as a thorn in their eyes. “Do you have something on that girl?”</p>\n<p>“Replying to young master, since Yashura Family is the main obstacle for us to get Young Lady Bhela Malikh to our side, your mother has already sent someone to investigate them. The eldest young lady of Yashura Family merely a Level 10 Specialist class who just graduated from Novice about seven months ago.”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood couldn’t help but chuckle. Even though the two young ladies had the same level, a Specialist merely support class that wasn’t suited in combat. This duel affair would turn out to be a joke.</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood scoffed. “Let my Bhela teach her some manners. I don’t want anyone to disturb us after this.”</p>\n<p>“Young master,” the adjutant lowered his voice, “I don’t think that’s a good idea.”</p>\n<p>“What’s on your mind, adjutant?”</p>\n<p>“I just made a round to check the guests attending this ceremony, and I found…”--he lowered his voice--“...some spectators amongst the guests that shouldn’t have be here….”</p>\n<p>“Go on,” the young noble urged.</p>\n<p>“I just received the word, young master, there are experts that Elder Jhamil said he didn’t invite.”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood frowned. “What… what’s that supposed to mean?”</p>\n<p>On the less crowded place of the courtyard, the middle-aged man who Bhela greeted before, along with the middle-aged woman, watched the commotion unfold while nibbling on steamed peanuts. He glanced at the other place where a man calmly sipping tea, a man with a hard face who couldn’t hide his sharp aura, then swept his gaze at the one who beside him, a short stature man who wore a headband to hide his reddish hair from public, who also happened to enjoy steamed peanuts while his focus solely at one direction in the crowd.</p>\n<p>All of them came in common garments incognito. But still Elder Jhamil sent people to keep tabs on them, especially since the bald elder still didn’t know the reason Bhela Malikh invited these foreigners.</p>\n<p>The ngajen ceremony usually consisted of three main parts--prayer, socializing, and sending offerings to the mountain as the finale. It was uncommon for irrelevant events to happen between them. However, since the young lady of the host had already accepted the duel, Malikh Family set up an emergency venue for the fight.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil came to invite himself as the judge. For a change to hummiliate those simple Yashuras and to slip himself onto the spotlight, he couldn’t ask for better opportunity.</p>\n<p>“You two ready?” Elder Jhamil asked both of the opposing sides. “This is a friendly match between two friendly families. So stop before your blade hit your enemy,” he said, seemingly talking to either sides, but didn’t say anything about the arrows part.</p>\n<p>Since Bhela Malikh was an Archer, she suggested to Mila, “I’m using a bow. So you can move first. I’ll try to dodge for ten seconds.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t need that,” Mila scoffed.</p>\n<p>“Very well…” she said. She glanced at Elder Jhamil, said, “Elder Jhamil, please begin the duel.&quot;</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil counted to three.</p>\n<p>The duel began.</p>\n<p>“AAAAAA!!!” Mila roared with the sword raised above her head, charging ahead.</p>\n<p>Contrast to her opponent’s battle cry, Bhela was solemn. She picked four arrows from the quiver tied on her hips. Nocking the arrows simultaneously, she took a deep breath as she concentrated to channel different natures elemental mana from her manasphere. The mana, through fingers and her thumb, flowing into all the four arrows and soon the tip of the arrows glowed with four different colors.</p>\n<p>The wind began to stir.</p>\n<p>And she raised the bow. She released the arrows.</p>\n<p><em>Fuuush fuuuushhh fuuushh shhuuuuusshh!</em></p>\n<p>Before even everyone noticed what happened, the mana Bhela channeled melted the flying arrows, within a span of milliseconds, turning them into dangerous magic projectiles of four elemental natures--fire, water, wind and lightning.</p>\n<p>Mila was confident before. She knew a trick against an Archer, but here she was dumbfounded by magic arrows coming to blast her way. She thought she was fighting an Archer, but got up against a Mage instead. This wasn’t what she signed up for.</p>\n<p><em>Clank!</em></p>\n<p>The first blue arrow dissapeared almost the moment it reached Mila. The sound of metallic clash that followed the said arrow resounded three more times, and the three arrows left behind too disappeared almost immediately. Mila, thought she ought to dodge the magic arrows, leap a step backward, but her hasty movement combined with the slippery mud made her slipped her foothold, accidentally fell to her butt instead.</p>\n<p>Bhela aimed down her bow. Everyone was staring at her with complicated and questioning gaze, as an Archer who could do magic, this was the first time everyone witnessed it.</p>\n<p>“It’s a four elemental affinity spell!” someone’s voice roared through the silenced venue, “I heard it, I doubted it, but she really did it!”</p>\n<p>Everyone looked at his way, the man who shouted, and saw that it was the middle-aged man whom Bhela invited from outside the village. He sat eating steamed peanuts then, now he was standing perplexed.</p>\n<p>Bhela, realizing that the man was the center of the attention, and bow to him from afar.</p>\n<p>“She really did it…” the man said under his breath.</p>\n<p>Someone who sat beside him said, “Sure she did, the only one right now--I guess now that you big brain from Elemental Stone School witnessed it I guess you can die without regret?”</p>\n<p>The man looked at the woman who accompanied him, he said still with expression of disbelieve, “It’s a four elemental affinity spell…”</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, you already said that.”</p>\n<p>The last and the most famous multi elemental Unique Class was, a mage with three elemental affinity skills, died of old age--was actually the headmaster of Elemental Stone School from seventy years ago. As a scholar and a mage researching deeply in topics of elemental mana all of his career, how could he didn’t know the value of a Unique Class who surpassed even the ex-headmaster of his school?</p>\n<p>“I can’t believe someone without a Mage Unique Class really did it…”</p>\n<p>“The most promising talent of this generation, alright, the first time I witnessed an Archer could do magic,” the woman said. “Good thing she stopped her arrows then--if not, the other girl would ended up so pitiful.”</p>\n<p>As the woman said that, someone else blurted not far away from there.</p>\n<p>“She didn’t stop it.”</p>\n<p>“Pardon? Sir Kurusiya?” the woman asked.</p>\n<p>The one she was talking to was the quiet man with sharp aura. He said as a matter of fact like tone, “She didn’t stop it. Someone else did,” he sipped his tea, and when the woman still confused, he explained with hoarse voice, “those are magic, but they were still arrows shot from a bow. You can’t stop flying arrows. That girl calculated and slightly missed her aim as to not hurting her opponent. But she didn’t plan to stop it.”</p>\n<p>The woman questioned him, “If she wasn’t the one who stopped it, then would you know why the arrows disappears?”</p>\n<p>The man put down his glass of tea. “I don’t know. Why you ask me? Ask that fool there who’s been grinning all the time.”</p>\n<p>The woman, along with the middle-aged man from Stone Elemental School, looked up to the bearded foreigner.</p>\n<p>“She’s not the one who stopped it,” the bearded man said with a smile.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Mila, who mellowed from her defeat and still sat on the muddy ground, gulped as she saw her cousin come to pick her up.</p>\n<p>“I lost,” she said to Shira.</p>\n<p>“No you didn’t, that girl is the one who put down her bow first, and you still got your swords in your hands--so technically you’d win.”</p>\n<p>“I fell to my butt, I was humiliated,” Mila said, her voice trembled, “I lost….”</p>\n<p>Shira sighed. He grabbed Mila’s hand and pulled her up. “It’s adult problems from hereon, Uncle Shuro would likely summon my father back. For now, let’s get out of here,” he said.</p>\n<p>Monkey and Snake, along with the nervous Romana, came to follow them from behind to shield them from people’s laughter. Mila was so humiliated the usually feisty tomboy was so down she couldn’t afford to hold her head straight. As Shira witnessed how pitiful his cousin was, regret overwhelming him when he remembered how he was holding back from taking action himself.</p>\n<p>“Brat,” someone called him.</p>\n<p>Shira turned his head. It was Good-Natured Spirit.</p>\n<p>“You owe me this time,” the Nalaq said.</p>\n<p>Shira nodded.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>“Hear ye hear ye people! Gather around and hear me announce something incredible, people! Gather around, will ya!”</p>\n<p>Standing on top of a table, Elder Jhamil shouted to gather people, announcing something that the Young Master of Blackwood Family passed him beforehands. “Although winner of the duel is Young Lady Bhela, Young Master Frane of Blackwood House is concerned by some stupid unruly girl of the supposed biggest family in Badril Village behavior would smear my young lady--”</p>\n<p>“Big news! Big news!” someone else’s shouting cut off Elder Jhamil’s announcement, “Young Master Bonithon is running around beating people! Watch your mouth if you don’t want get beaten for no reason!”</p>\n<p>“Bony is going crazy! He’s going to kick people’s asses! Nobody knows why!”</p>\n<p>“What the fuck is going on! Why Elzhier Family messing with us Malikhs now?”</p>\n<p>At the chaotic scene before him, Elder Jhamil’s face showed a frown and a hint of hesitation. He then cleared his phlegm anyway, trying to get people’s attention, then pushed on announcing carefully, “Young Master Frane Blackwood is concerned that--”</p>\n<p>“Elder Jhamil!!” a servant came running with a horrified expression, “Bony is coming for you, run away!”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil pointed his finger at the servant and roared, “What is that brat from Elzhier Family wants to do with me! Go kick him out, I’m trying to tell everybody something important here!”</p>\n<p>“But he doesn’t listen to reasons! He’s going to punch your face, is what he said just now!”</p>\n<p>“Imbecile! Do you think a young master would jump around like a monkey and punch an elder of another family in the damn face?! He’s making ruckus. Go on, kick him out!”</p>\n<p>Looking at the crowd from the rushedly made stage, he then smiled and continued, “Right, everybody, it’s Young Master of Blackwood Family; what I’m saying is that since Young Lady Bhela Malikh is winning with ease against the foolish young lady of <em>that</em> family, Young Master Blackwood concerned that some people would shrug my young lady’s victory. So he proposed, in order to make it clear the disparity between Malikh and--sheesh--Yashura, he proposed that him as a friendly representative of Malikh Family and Shira Yashura as the repre--”</p>\n<p>“Elder Jhamil--watch out!”</p>\n<p>He had it taking from lowly servants who cut off his announcement. Fuming in anger, Elder Jhamil pointed his finger toward the one who was spriting toward him and roared, “How many times I told you to just kick him out! Shut your trap and go kick the damned brat!”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was losing his cool. But what he failed to realize in time was that the one who sprinted toward him wasn’t a servant from his family. It was not the one who telling him to run away. And before he knew it, someone leaped up on the table where he was standing and delivered a punch to the face.</p>\n<p>“Gaaahhh!”</p>\n<p>Even after Elder Jhamil stumbled down the table he stood on, his assaulter didn’t plan to let him go. And what came after that was a torrent of hardened fist, pummeling his face even though he screamed for mercy. Only when the chaotic crowd succeeded in saving him did Elder Jhamil see the assaulter’s face--it was indeed the Young Master from Elzhier Family.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Bonithon… what did you… why did you do this… for what reason?!” Elder Jhamil choked out his grievance.</p>\n<p>Bony, the man who beat the bald elder black and blue, replied with nothing but a cold stare. Instead, it was an almost incoherent voice of Pilek who answered instead.</p>\n<p>“Kekekek, don’t be angry Elder Baldy! We just discussed how you were a splendid Pugilist a long time ago, so Boss Bony came here to find out whether it was true or not! That’s why he asked you to a barehand duel!” Pilek came in with a swagger and a bottle of booze in his hand. From a single glance anybody could tell he was drunk.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s lips trembled. What duel? That brat just leaped out of nowhere without saying anything, then immediately beating him black and blue!</p>\n<p>The only one from the three delinquents who hadn’t had the smell of liquor from his body was Polio. He wore an apologetic smile, and with a slight sigh, he said, “Please forgive them, dear kind Malikh sirs, my friends are terrible when they are drunk.”</p>\n<p>Polio made a round to apologize to any Malikhs he saw. But the Malikh Family didn’t appreciate his gesture, receiving jeerings in return.</p>\n<p>Polio was a patient young man, but Pilek wasn’t. The drunk Pilek didn’t take their attitude kindly, randomly walking to a servant, said, “Hah? What the fuck are you staring me at, you no-name Malikh servant? Wanna die, eh? Huuuraah!!!”</p>\n<p><em>Shatter!</em></p>\n<p>Without a warning he swung the booze in his hand to a Malikh family servant. The man he attacked stumbled backward holding his bloodied head from the crash Pilek gave him.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Bhela Malikh had just settled greeting four foreign guests that she invited from outside, and was on her way to fetch cuisines from the kitchen to humor her guests, then she witnessed the chaotic brawl unfold with a crowdful of cheers and jeers mixed in between. Perhaps there were more than a dozen men involved, with the Malikhs servants, guards, common family members even an elder came along to surround Bony and his two underlings.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela…” a little maidservant with a crest of Elzhier Family in her uniform bowed to Bhela politely.</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at her. She returned the bow even though the other party clearly was a servant. “Miss Elzhier,” she spoke softly.</p>\n<p>“No need to be polite to this servant, Young Lady.”</p>\n<p>“I can’t be impolite to Sister Ryntia’s friends.”</p>\n<p>The Elzhier Family maidservant smiled. Since Bhela insisted, then she wouldn’t be bowing her head anymore.</p>\n<p>She said, “Eldest Young Lady sends me to ask for your forgiveness for her brother’s brashness, Young Lady Bhela.”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at the brawl that started in her family’s courtyard. This chaos would spell imperfect on tonight's Malikh Family’s Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>“There’s no need for that. Since I accepted Young Lady Mila Yashura’s duel then I somewhat anticipated Young Master Bonithon will follow suit to make trouble tonight. If anything, it is I the one who should apologize to Sister Ryntia because I couldn’t handle the situation well. Please tell her that I’ll try to maintain friendship between Malikh and Elzhier Family.”</p>\n<p>Still with the serene smile on her face, the Elzhier Family maidservant studied the expression on Bhela’s face. She spoke a moment after, “Then I’ll let Eldest Young Lady Elzhier knows by tomorrow.”</p>\n<p>“Thanks,” Bhela offered her gratitude with a bow.</p>\n<p>By this time, the brawl became anything but intensified, as men either from Elzhier Family or thugs that previously had dealings with Bony’s group came in to reinforce the Elzhier young master. Before the Malikhs could pressure the intruders with numbers, but then the completely overwhelmed by the new reinforcement.</p>\n<p>“Huurraaahh!” Pilek sent a Malikh man flying with his kick. “Where the fuck your previous cocky taunt? Cat got your tongue, eh?”</p>\n<p>The only unspoken rules in brawls were strictly no usage of mana and spell as well as no sharp objects to use as weapons. But when it was chaotic and nobody could watch everybody the sharpest mind with tricks the one who prevailed--this is why the likes of Pilek and his friend Polio who always struck in place people wouldn’t be willing the one who were taking the advantage in brawls. Even hunters and seasoned guards were no match against these naughty brats.</p>\n<p>For example, when Pilek’s punch was blocked by Elder Jhamil’s son, “You shitty brat, just wait till I deal with your father--kuukgghh!”</p>\n<p>And because no one was watching, Pilek used his knee to strike the cocky young elder in the balls.</p>\n<p>With a sad whimper from his trembling lips, Elder Jhamil’s son curled onto the ground holding his precious balls that Polio struck.</p>\n<p>Seeing that a family elder was mercilessly defeated, a few Malikhs came to avenge their young elder. By then, Pilek already had Polio watching over his back.</p>\n<p>At that point, no Malikhs could match them in hand-in-hand brawl.</p>\n<p>A stranger then casually walked in. Pilek stopped, looking at him, and amidst the chaotic scene it took a while for him to find out that the man was actually a foreigner--an eastern Kaya man. The man had a sheathed sword on his hips. But Pilek wasn’t afraid as long as he stick with the brawl rules to use only fighting unarmed.</p>\n<p>“Huurraaah!”</p>\n<p>Pilek threw a feint. Most simple Malikhs would fall for this. But the eastern Kaya man didn’t budge. Seemed to even anticipate it. With a movement too fast for Pilek to follow the man grabbed his wrist, flicked him and sent him into the air like it was nothing.</p>\n<p>It was only after Pilek rolled in the mud he realized what had happened.</p>\n<p>The man then glanced aside and walked toward Polio who in his own right was too engrossed with the brawl. With his left hand pushing Polio’s shoulder and the other hand grabbing his wrist, he flipped Polio just like he did Pilek beforehand.</p>\n<p>Pilek and a few others that the man previously flipped were amazed by how effortlessly the man disabling enthusiastic young men from fighting.</p>\n<p>The sword handle the man had was wrapped with cloth and its body too thin for regular blades. Those who noticed this would understand that the man wasn’t an ordinary Kaya. Polio was one of them.</p>\n<p>“A Samurai!” he exclaimed a moment after he got thrown onto the muddy ground.</p>\n<p>The Kaya man stopped, looking at him, then spoke with a displeased tone, “I am but a masterless ronin.”</p>\n<p>The man then continued walking toward a different direction.</p>\n<p>Bony was fighting with three men alone, so he couldn’t afford to look around. He didn’t realize the Kaya man at first, but when the man tried to grab the wild young master’s wrist, Bony reacted--he reacted by throwing a punch to the man’s face.</p>\n<p>The man slapped his flying fist from the side, tremendously muffled its momentum. Again, he tried to grab Bony’s wrist and his shoulder. Bony tried resisting but the man’s speed was too fast for him to compete.</p>\n<p>As the man prepared to flip him, Bony felt a faint gush of the wind from his legs. It didn’t take him a second to realize the man just putting his hand on his shoulder as a feint--his real target was to gently nudge his foot on rooting from the ground, which, if he’d focus his effort to get his shoulder free from the man’s grasp, a small window of opening that could be used by his opponent to disrupt his sense of balance. Thus Bony firmly stomped his feet to the ground instead. He grabbed the man’s sleeve to make his opponent not be able to easily throw like Pilek and Polio.</p>\n<p>Responding to Bony’s choice, the man curled the corner of his lips. Bony caught a hint of taunt when he staring the man in the eyes.</p>\n<p>“Kkuuuggghh!”</p>\n<p>Bony did succeed in preventing himself get flipped to the ground. But he got struck in the gut instead.</p>\n<p>The man didn’t let him go. The moment Bony stepping backward due to shock having stricken, the man was charging and got his wrist in the blink of the eyes--what happened afterward was Bony got his feet swept and he completely lost his ground, and got cheered by his friends as the last man who got thrown into the mud.</p>\n<p>Bony then sat there looking as the fight stopped; since someone took him down, more and less the Malikhs had won the brawl.</p>\n<p>“Aren’t you Thoqek’s son?” the Kaya man asked Bony.</p>\n<p>Bony wasn’t willing to open his mouth when his father’s name got mentioned.</p>\n<p>Receiving no answer, the man thus carelessly said, “Unexpectedly, you’ve got more guts than your father. Get up now, and stop making trouble in Ghalim Malikh’s home.”</p>\n<p>The young ruffians with Bony as the leader naturally wouldn’t be arrogant anymore since they had been defeated. They retreated calmly, and the Malikhs didn’t dare taunt them the second time in case Bony would change his mind and started on a rampage again. In the end, the real reason why Bony came targeting Malikh Family, as many people knew, was that he wasn’t a drinker that would lose reason to punch another family’s elder in the face.</p>\n<p>Speaking about an elder who got a punch in the face; after Bony and others were gone, Elder Jhamil showed his nose out of his hiding place. He gritted his teeth. He swore he’d use his full resource to get back from Bony’s father in the next village council meeting.</p>\n<p>“Elder Jhamil, you still haven’t announced the thing I ask you to do,” from behind, the sullen young noble Frane Blackwood said to him.</p>\n<p>“Y-young Master Blackwood, please spare me--the mood isn’t that good to draw people’s attention after that kid crashing our Ngajen Ceremony just now. How about I brief it to other village leaders tomorrow in the village council meeting?”</p>\n<p>“No, I want everyone to know it by tonight. This is the right time and the right place to announce it. Besides, I want to see what kind of a young man the one who’s supposed to be my rival.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil didn’t want to show his beaten face to the crowd tonight. But as much as he love his face he knew flattery wouldn’t get him out of this situation--at least not if he didn’t want to offend the young noble. And so with a heavy face he climbed the table once again, hiding off his reluctancy.</p>\n<p>Someone heartily made a joke on him, “Elder Jhamil, we thought you’re a man who care about face the most--I don’t expect you to boldly show how handsome you’ve become now!”</p>\n<p>“Kids nowadays getting big headed by their privileges as young masters--naturally I’ll let their fathers know how to discipline their brats!” Elder Jhamil coldly said. “Anyway, you all know that my Young Lady Bhela is a girl with talent and her future is boundless. Here in Malikh Family we’re not willing to throw our princess to cow’s dunk that is Yashura Family’s trash young master. And our friend Young Noble Frane Blackwood also thinks the same!”</p>\n<p>Such passionate speech, naturally people were cheering in anticipation of the next spectacle they thought they were going to witness.</p>\n<p>Getting the cue from Elder Jhamil, Frane Blackwood came forward with a swagger. “I speak this as a close friend of Young Lady Bhela Malikh. Someone with the name of Shira Yashura; if you think you’re worthy of her, do you dare to prove it by having a duel with me?!”</p>\n<p>The crowd was silent. They were waiting for the reply.</p>\n<p>Frane Blackwood swept the crowd with his eyes.</p>\n<p>Someone said to him the boy he challenged was utter trash. He was amused guessing how this trash would respond to his duel challenge, especially when Bhela Malikh had just completely defeated the cheeky young lady from his family.</p>\n<p>There were already murmurs spreading. People were also curious whether Shira was going to accept or run away from it.</p>\n<p>And then…</p>\n<p>“<em>Cough, cough…</em>” someone awkwardly stepped forward with a wry smile plastered on his face. People recognized his face, which looked like a monkey, and many of them had seen him together with Shira Yashura.</p>\n<p>He was Monkey. He said, “This young noble… about your proposed duel… I’m afraid Young Master Shira Yashura can’t answer it tonight.”</p>\n<p>Frane Blackwood laughed. “Why? He’s scared? His cousin challenged Young Lady Bhela to a duel for no apparent reason; don’t tell me we can do the same to them?”</p>\n<p>“No, it’s not that.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil pointed his finger at Monkey. “We all know Shira Yashura is a trash who can’t even advance to Level 4 Novice! Young Master Frane Blackwood is kind. Tonight, he’s going to give Shira one chance to admit that he’s unworthy of Young Lady Bhela Malikh to the crowd here. He does that, and there will be no need for Young Master Frane Blackwood to embarrass him by kicking his ass!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, but he can’t give you an answer tonight,” Monkey insisted.</p>\n<p>Now it was Elder Jhamil who laughed. “He’s really scared facing Young Master Frane right now?!”</p>\n<p>“No…”</p>\n<p>“Then why?”</p>\n<p>Monkey sighed.</p>\n<p>“Because he’s already gone home!”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was furious. The whole point he had to gather people even though his face had been beaten by Bony was to call out the boy and embarrass him in public, as per the young noble request. But the said person himself already went home, so Elder Jhamil standing on top of the table was for nothing.</p>\n<p>Immediately he ordered a servant to send the message to Yashura Family, while in between, cursing the fact that he didn’t get the chance to distract the guests from discussing the previous brawl. Sure enough, not only the people were talking about Bhela Malikh’s hidden Unique Class, they were also talking about Bony, and people he beat to pulp, especially Elder Jhamil. People no longer cared to gossip about Young Lady Mila Yashura who had been sent home defeated, but they laughed at someone present who had just his misfortune like Elder Jhamil instead.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil had lost his face in the end. Literally and metaphorically.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, with a solemn expression Monkey looked at his partner Snake who was enjoying the banquet and had amused himself watching the spectacle previously.</p>\n<p>Monkey said with a whisper, “Why the hell your family doesn’t show his face when they dumping shit to Young Master and Young Lady Yashura just now?!”</p>\n<p>Snake glanced at him lazily. “I don’t know. They said they were going to diagnose Patriarch Ghalim Malikh previously.”</p>\n<p>“Can’t you just fetch your brother instead? Didn’t you put your words to assure young master before this? What if he thinks we’re people who put our words lightly?”</p>\n<p>“The one who’s diagnosing the patriarch is my grandfather, my brother supposed to be free enough to be a busybody just now,” Snake said, displeased by Monkey’s tone accusing him of being unloyal to his own word.</p>\n<p>Actually, he also confused why his brother didn’t show his nose when Young Lady Mila recklessly brought a sword to challenge Bhela to a duel. From his understanding of his brother’s character and the relationship between his family and Yashura from what he knew told him that more or less his brother was going to back Yashura if the drama with Malikh Family intensified. But he didn’t. Snake would barge into Malikh Family’s doors to look for his grandfather if he knew it was going to be like this instead.</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-6/chapter-4":"<p>Badril Village, though had been two years passed without her presence, was the same as always for Bhela Malikh. She hadn’t that many acquaintances her age she could consider friendly before. In spite of that, from the day she returned, people act as if they were her rekindled childhood friends she never knew she had.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela,” a daughter of an elder from Elzhier Family asked curiously, “is the rumor about that story true?”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at her with eyelids half-closed.</p>\n<p>“Which rumor?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, silly you, of course <em>that</em> rumor! The one about your romance with a blue blood noble!”</p>\n<p>Giggles of girls followed after the girl’s words. When Bhela returned to Badril Village she brought not only fame and reputation, but interesting stories and rumors as well. She was currently surrounded by curious young ladies who sought for exciting gossip.</p>\n<p>“Yeah, yeah!” another girl excitedly hussing in low voice. “I heard he’ll attend Malikh’s ngajen ceremony tonight!”</p>\n<p>“Really?”</p>\n<p>“Why else would Young Lady Bhela take the Chef Chief position if she didn’t expect for her lover to come tonight? He’ll come for sure!”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, yeah, everybody is saying Young Lady Bhela doing just for that!”</p>\n<p>Bhela found it was amazing how people could conjure their own rumors despite not seeing the true story by their own eyes.</p>\n<p>And just when the young ladies started getting excited discussing Young Lady Bhela’s ‘love life’, a vigorous shout resounded the courtyard announcing that Blackwood Family had arrived.</p>\n<p>“Blackwood Family?” someone cocked their head and looked over the direction of the gate. “What kind of family is so bold announcing their names in other family’s ngajen ceremony? Not even Village Head’s Elzhier Family would do to the ceremony host!”</p>\n<p>“Only foreigners to be that stupid to be rude in big family like Malikh! If this is my place I’d send a guard to kick their ass out as soon as possible!”</p>\n<p>“Look over there! Malikh Family elders are rushing to the gate! Let’s check out how’s Malikhs going to deal with it!”</p>\n<p>Curious guests were tailing the elders to see some commotion they thought would occur. However, not only did the Malikhs not make a fuss over it, they even bowed their heads toward the newly arrived noble as if they were servants greeting their returning master. Young people were overly excited because nobles were foreign and appeared in stories all of their lives.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Mila, who already went back with her friend, was gritting teeth with anger. Beside her Romana was holding the tomboy back, though concerned she didn't say a word.</p>\n<p>“Why should I am the one who always had to hold myself back?” Mila hissed in a low voice as if she was wronged.</p>\n<p>“Look around and think about who’s receiving the blow the most. Everyone’s talking about your cousin right now--do you want to make it worse for him?”</p>\n<p>After hearing her friend’s warning, Mila began to take a deep breath and think things through. Romana was right. When she opened her ears Mila could hear people comparing the young master of this noble Blackwood Family with her cousin Shira. They compared such a gallant-looking young noble with a trash of Yashura Family young master, adding with their own biased seasoning here and there, making her cousin Shira look really bad. Mila trembled as her face boiled red from holding back her anger.</p>\n<p>“Where’s Shira right now?”</p>\n<p>“I think he went hiding!” Romana said.</p>\n<p>“Hiding?! He’s embarrassed to show his face that much?”</p>\n<p>After circling around a bit, Mila found the boy’s silhouette in the shadow far from the braziers' light. There, he was squatting, hiding along with two other silhouettes who were also squatting in a suspicious manner.</p>\n<p>“Now, young master, where the hell did you get this coin?” someone whispered from the suspicious bunch.</p>\n<p>The reply came also in the same hushed manner. “Don’t ask me now, just know I’ve got a few more hidden in my house. I can’t move my family, but if you’re fine with this, I can invest in your goods earlier.”</p>\n<p>“We’re fine? Of course we’re fine! Don’t you know how amazing this coin is?”</p>\n<p>“It’s amazing? I can’t even buy satays with this. Nobody here would receive unfamiliar currency.”</p>\n<p>“But don’t you know how far ahead you can go if merchants know you grab some of these coins?”</p>\n<p>“You tell me.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, these coins weren’t issued by any countries, but they’re valuable. Lots of herbs and ingredients in the black markets can only be bought with these coins...”</p>\n<p><em>...whisper whisper whisper...</em></p>\n<p>Mila approached.</p>\n<p>“Ey, what are you doing?!”</p>\n<p>For some reasons, Shira and Monkey, one of his companions, almost jumped in fright by her barking. Both Mila and Romana behind her saw Shira and Monkey were acting suspicious--but Sneak, the third silhouette, didn’t even try to hide that he was nibbling on something delicious.</p>\n<p>Mila, with a weird face, hissed, “Is that… <em>rendang</em> you guys were eating?”</p>\n<p>“<em>Cough, cough,</em>” hiding the opened wrapping banana leaves, Shira awkwardly trying to make an excuse, “I think Malikh Family is too eager to cut off relationships with our Yashura Family so… I reckon they don’t need this anymore…”</p>\n<p>Mila was so angry she slapped the banana leaves in Shira’s hand.</p>\n<p>“Ah, my rendang…”</p>\n<p>“Your rendang?! You goddamn moron!” Mila hissed, she didn’t dare to roar and announce themselves to other guests. “You’re about to get cuckolded and all you think about is a goddamn rendang?!”</p>\n<p>“Young master, someone trying to get you cuckolded?” licking his fingers for some leftover rendang sauce, Snake asked from the side.</p>\n<p>Shira shook his head. “Cuckold is a very strong word. That girl didn’t even consider me from the beginning. It’s not like we're a married couple yet.”</p>\n<p>He then came to pick the spoiled beef and mourned, “ah… my poor rendang.”</p>\n<p>“Stop crying over that shit! It’s not important!”</p>\n<p>Monkey blurted, “Rendang is not important?”</p>\n<p>Mila glared at Monkey. The monkey-faced peddler closed his mouth as soon as he opened it.</p>\n<p>Romana saw her friend Mila had a bad affinity with her cousin whenever she was angry, thus came to explain from the side, “Young Master Shira, don’t you know people outside the Mossack culture do take engagement seriously? It’s understandable for a young heir of a conservative family like Yashura to not care much about it--but, whatever your feelings regarding your engagement is, if Young Lady Bhela has an affair outside, she’ll also drag down Yashura Family’s reputation. So please be mindful about it more for the sake of your family.”</p>\n<p>They didn’t really think about this deeply since straightforward Mossack people were the type to have children before they were even married. If things went awry, Shira reckoned his uncle and the elders in his family might think the engagement matter was similar to puppy love, about children bantering, but the young generation who was exposed to stories and gossips from books and travellers might think about it differently. And someone who didn’t hang out so much like Shira wouldn’t be able to tell how these youngsters would talk about this incident in the future.</p>\n<p>So Shira stood up and patted his trouser, admitted, “Ah, you’re right, Romana.”</p>\n<p>Mila crossed her arms. Frowning at her cousin. “What are you gonna do now? Fight them? No need to be afraid, I’m with you.”</p>\n<p>Snake, still squatting comfortably, added, “Young Master, my grandfather and my older brother are still here too. You won’t be at a disadvantage in case things go downhill.”</p>\n<p>“It’s decided. Let’s kick their asses!” Mila growled.</p>\n<p>“The heck are you talking about kicking people’s asses in Ngajen Ceremony?” Shira grunted.</p>\n<p>“Then at least let me slap that slut’s arrogant face!”</p>\n<p>Shira shook his head.</p>\n<p>“Let’s go,” he said.</p>\n<p>“We’re gonna slap her face now?” Mila asked.</p>\n<p>“No. We at least have to make Family Yashura’s presence known here,” Shira said. He caught his companions’ confused expressions, so he added, “Everyone is getting excited because most of them are young'uns. But if this incident gets out of the hands, the elders from other families won’t be silent about it.”</p>\n<p>Mila wanted to say something but didn’t after seeing Shira’s relaxed face. She didn’t want to say something silly that’d change the boy’s mind. Therefore, with Shira leading the way, she and her friend Romana went to see the ruckus caused by the noble’s arrival. Leaving Monkey and Sneak who were silent looking at their back.</p>\n<p>The two exchanged glances.</p>\n<p>They looked down, eyes sweeping the ground.</p>\n<p>“Mm?” Monkey mumbled, his hands crawling all over the dirt.</p>\n<p>Snake took out a magic wand. The wand shimmered with a gentle light, then he used that to give some light to the ground where the rendang was spoiled.</p>\n<p>But it was Monkey who shouted in joy, “I got one!”</p>\n<p>“Give me that!” Snake pounced the moment he saw Monkey rubbed the dirt of a piece of rendang.</p>\n<p>Pushing out Snake’s face from grabbing the rendang in his hand, Monkey felt wronged and cried, “Why would a rich gentleman like you fight over a single beef with this poor peddler? Don’t you know my family can only afford to eat beef once a year?”</p>\n<p>“Why, you asked?” Snake sneered, “There’s no need to say the obvious. You don’t get to eat Patriarch Shuro’s handmade rendang everyday! And I’m saying this after starving for beef ever since I’m following you.”</p>\n<p>“Fuck off!”</p>\n<p>“Give me that!”</p>\n<p>“No!”</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the shadowy corner where they were wrestling came to be lightened up with a lit torch.</p>\n<p>“Ehem, you two gentlemen,” a voice called.</p>\n<p>For a moment, Monkey and Snake stopped fighting.</p>\n<p>The voice owner was a man with Malikh Family’s servant uniform. Reluctantly, he continued, “Badril Village locals are usually open-minded and tolerant people. However, we have a bottom line. If you two couldn’t hold it you should rent some inn room or do it in the bushes! Don’t do it in the open, you’re making people uncomfortable! Know some shame!”</p>\n<p>Monkey at first didn’t get what the servant was talking about. Then he realized during infighting over the rendang, he had opened his legs, and Snake was on top of him in a very, very awkward manner.</p>\n<p>“Dammit!” he kicked Snake and trembling over the horror he caught himself in. But suddenly he noticed the rendang in his hand already vanished. He whirled his head around. Snake was already licking his fingers with a satisfied face.</p>\n<p>“Dammit!” Monkey howled again.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>The one who enthusiastically greeted the young noble of Blackwood Family was Elder Jhamil instead of Bhela Malikh. He managed to conjure thirty years worth of bullshitting skills to flatter and fawn over the other party, rather thick faced to continue despite the young master of noble family rolled his eyes several times. As soon as the young noble caught the sight of a short-haired girl he immediately escaped from Elder Jhamil’s clutch with a big grin on his face.</p>\n<p>“Ah, Sister Bhela!”</p>\n<p>“Young Master Frane Blackwood.”</p>\n<p>“How are you doing Young Lady Bhela? Fancy to meet you again,” he said as he gifted the girl a flower.</p>\n<p>Bhela received the flower but then immediately passed it to a random maidservant beside her. She said as if it was nothing, “I’m fine. Thank you.”</p>\n<p>Young Master Frane Blackwood smiled wryly. “I’ve been travelling with hardly any rest so that I can see you sooner, my young lady,” the young master of Blackwood Family, Frane Blackwood, said, “may I be so lucky to receive your company tonight?”</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry, but here the words ‘tonight’s companion’ have different meanings than when you say it in the western-style ball--so, no, Young Master Blackwood, I can’t give you company tonight,” she said.</p>\n<p>The young noble still had a smile and wanted to correct his wording, but Bhela suddenly raised her hand and said, “Excuse me.”</p>\n<p>She went past him and greeted another pair of guests instead.</p>\n<p>“Greeting, sir, madam.”</p>\n<p>“It’s about time,” the middle-aged man didn’t answer Bhela’s greeting, but complained instead. “You know the other families had begun their ceremonies, right? Even though we don’t have the same ceremony as your Ngajen Ceremony from the place where I come from, but I know those who don’t take any old ceremonies seriously only brought bad luck over their lands.”</p>\n<p>There was a rare restraint in Bhela’s voice as she replied, “I apologize for our bad conduct, Sir Instructor. I will request the elders to proceed with the ceremony. Please let me lead you toward the reserved spot I previously prepared for both of you.”</p>\n<p>“Lead the way then.”</p>\n<p>Badril Village locals witnessed the valiant Young Lady of Malikh Family taking charge of the Ngajen Ceremony as the Chief Chef, but with the appearance of her bowing to two unfamiliar guests as well, whispers were floating amongst the Ngajen Ceremony guests. Before long, everyone knew that two guests Bhela Malikh greeted were the ones she personally invited, but was neglected before the family’s gate because of the excitement made by the noble’s arrival. Bhela came to them to apologize in person.</p>\n<p>Young Master Frane Blackwood, who felt ignored, pulled a self-decrepitating sneer. He complained to Elder Jhamil instead, “Oh, Malikh Family elder, can you tell me the identity of those two guests who made even Young Lady Bhela to bow her head?”</p>\n<p>“Ehem, ehem,” Elder Jhamil didn’t know what to answer, so he concocted a reply out of thin air, “I think they were relatives from her maternal family.”</p>\n<p>“Is that so? From the way they are dressed, they don’t look from that respectable background enough to get the young lady’s full attention. Don’t you think so?”</p>\n<p>“Young noble is right. Young Lady Bhela’s father once was a gangster thus he didn’t manage to teach common sense to the young lady. I’ll talk to her later to explain what’s really important.”</p>\n<p>After a bit of excuse and fawning, Young Master Blackwood felt this Elder Jhamil was acceptable. He told the Blackwood Family’s servants to bring the gifts he had prepared, which were naturally accepted by Elder Jhamil on the young lady’s behalf. In the meantime, people were disappointed that the drama they were expecting didn’t happen. But what could they do besides shaking their heads and disperse?</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Year after year, the ngajen ceremony evolved from stiff sessions of praying ceremony for village safety to the new stylish festivities of foods and happy times for the youngsters, where fads and trends emerge. However big their way of life was changing the conservative major families, Yashura and Elzhier, still pretty much followed the old ways, especially when it came to the prayers. Only Malikh Family amongst the three that eager to embrace the new world that was coming. And by Elder Jhamil’s direction, instead of local shamans, Malikh Family asked help from foreign priests from western orthodox temples from nearby villages to lead the prayer.</p>\n<p>It was all good if one made a progressive decision with the greater good in mind. But here was the problem; orthodox temple priests usually led prayers for abundant harvest, while Ngajen Ceremony was all about calming Selaqs from descending the mountain. These priests probably hadn’t any clue how Selaqs looked like.</p>\n<p>“It was inappropriate for a noble to pray to old Mossack deities they don’t believe in, that was Malikhs’ excuses,'' Mila complained non-stop since they finished praying with other guests. In her hands--like a young mother hugging her baby--were plates of food she had just plundered from Malikh Family’s banquet tables prepared to entertain guests.</p>\n<p>“What deity? Wasn’t the mantra replaced from ancient Mossack prayers to magic spell mantra to calm down Selaq since… I don’t know, fifty years ago?” Romana said. The food in her hands was no less than Mila’s. These two girls seemed to think Malikh Family would regret offending them if they plunder the latter’s prepared feast like no tomorrow.</p>\n<p>“That's what I was saying! We no longer those ancient Mossacks who would sacrifice relatives so Selaqs won’t come down the mountain! Nowadays we’ve been using legit spells to keep all those Selaqs away, and these stupid Malikhs want to change the tradition just to appease some visiting noble? They’d rather avoid their noble guest to be uncomfortable than preventing Selaqs from coming down to chew their stupid brains, hah!”</p>\n<p>Compared to noisy girls beside him, Shira was able to keep his head to his feet. Romana signaled Mila with her eyes when she realized the boy wasn’t so into retaliating against the Malikhs; instead of invading the feast Shira, grabbed Malikh Family’s snacks moderately whenever he could--just like any other normal guests that came here.</p>\n<p>Mila grumbled with a bad mood, faced Shira and said, “Don’t you have something you need to do?”</p>\n<p>“Like what?” Shira hoped this cheeky cousin of his wouldn’t say something about kicking people’s asses again.</p>\n<p>“We can’t wait for something to happen,” she said. “Go ask that bitc--I mean, that fiancée of yours--go ask for a dance. The young’uns are starting to get heated. Look there, one of them couples are dancing. You go join them since that short-haired cunt is your fiancée after all.”</p>\n<p>Mila glanced around for a while before she realized she just had her tongue slipped. She quickly corrected her previous words, “Did I say cunt? I mean short-haired bitch--no, short-haired <em>young lady</em>.”</p>\n<p>“Why don’t you just be honest with yourself here. People have been calling Malikhs much worse here because the foreign priests matter!” Romana laughed.</p>\n<p>At that moment a very young maidservant of Malikh Family just passed by and overheard their conversation. The little maidservant snorted in anger, which made Mila snorted back as a retort.</p>\n<p>“Go, go! Go dance with her!” Mila whispered when she was sure only Shira and Romana were around.</p>\n<p>Shira clicked his tongue. “I don’t even have a single proper conversation with her these past ten years. Why should I go ask her dance out of the blue? Just showing our face around here is enough.”</p>\n<p>“Fool! If she accepted to dance with you then all is good, that would only confirm Malikh Family’s cocky attitude is only because their dipshit brains are getting fried by their own inflated proud ego, nothing serious! But if she ignores you in front of others… heh--she dares!”</p>\n<p>“That’s easy for you to say. If someone you don’t like suddenly asks your hands for a dance, what would you feel later on when you found out refusing means two families become enemies?”</p>\n<p>“Uh-uh, I don’t feel nothing. If he’s my fiancé then it’s my job to go my way out to make it clear in public! Going dancing, going kissing, like a proper damned couple! That’s what the goddamn engagement is all about! Right?”</p>\n<p>Mila ate a cookie and she blinked. Unsure of the previous words she said, she glanced at Romana and murmured, “...right?”</p>\n<p>Romana shrugged.</p>\n<p>But Shira wouldn’t back down easily. He continued arguing, “What if your fiancé is Bony Elzhier, then? Are you going to kiss him to prove he’s your fiancé?”</p>\n<p>Mila hid her gasp.</p>\n<p>“You wanna die?” she pursed her lips. “Listen to me or I’m gonna smack your face!”</p>\n<p>Shira groaned against his cousin’s unreasonableness. But before he could concoct a satisfying retort, Snake and Monkey came out of nowhere.</p>\n<p>“Oh, Young Master Shira,” Monkey came patting him on the shoulder, “it seems you get cuckolded for real this time.”</p>\n<p>People were clapping and whistling as the flashy Young Master Frane Blackwood led Young Lady Bhela Malikh by the hand.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Malikh was entertaining two guests previously, but that bald elder raised a fuss about how she neglected the young noble, so in the end it came to this.”</p>\n<p>Monkey laughed as he teased Shira with his elbow, “They’re going to dance. When two people were dancing in Ngajen Ceremony, that meant they--” he caught the scary experssion on Mila’s face, stopped, “nevermind…”</p>\n<p>“That slut!” Mila hissed.</p>\n<p>This was getting serious. Whenever Mila showed that kind of face something bad would happen. Again, the moment Shira opened his mouth to say something, someone else came to grab him in the shoulder.</p>\n<p>“Brat, your woman is going to cuckold you in public,” said the newcomer, Good-Natured Spirit, who literally came out of the thin air.</p>\n<p>“You too?”</p>\n<p>Shira had a headache. Both Monkey and Snake couldn’t see the annoying Good-Natured Spirit, but the three of them were in harmony in mocking him. They mocked him to the point saying he wouldn’t care would only embarrass him further.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, being led by the hand, Bhela Malikh asked Young Master Blackwood, “What kind of remedy Blackwood Family brought with you?”</p>\n<p>“Why so much in hurry, my young lady?” the young noble gave a laugh and a flash of smile. “No need to worry, Blackwood Family sympathize with the disaster that befell your father, so my mother send me here to personally deliver the medicine Blackwood House had sought far and wide.”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh said nothing more. The Young Master of Blackwood Family pondered as he read the cold expression of the girl, thinking that even with flowers and jewelry gifts, nothing could move this young lady. Such a waste of that beautiful face to not letting a single smile escaped, Young Master Blackwood could only smacked his lips and shook his head. But as soon as he mentioned a medicine he brought for her father, the feisty young lady became amiable almost immediately.</p>\n<p>Good thing for him. Bhela Malikh was talented, the Blackwood Family planned to have her inside their house, and if things went this smoothly he could do that his mother told him sooner than he expected.</p>\n<p>“Little bitch of Malikh Family,” a girl roared, “you finally show your true color you bitch! Is Yashura Family a joke to you?!”</p>\n<p>The furious Mila Yashura became the center of attention. She snorted as she strode, like an angry bull preparing to charge, with the mood that would make the crowd wordlessly give way to her. Not only because they didn’t want anything to do with the infamous young lady of Yashura Family--who, when angry, once punched Bony in the face with a nosebleed--but also because she got a sword in her hands.</p>\n<p>Shira glanced down. His father’s sword he brought with him was gone. He looked again at the unsheated weapon in his cousin’s hands.</p>\n<p>He could only slap his own face the moment he noticed what was happened.</p>\n<p>Mila took a step forward slowly, but her face turned even fiercer. She spoke, “You got guts to bring a lover from outside, eh? I knew something fishy happened when I saw you cut your hair, you little slut.”</p>\n<p>“I cut my hair because it got in the way during my training,” Bhela replied plainly. “And this is not my lover. Just a relative of my friend.”</p>\n<p>“You lying little slut. As if someone like you have any friends!”</p>\n<p>“I do have a friend.” Bhela said. A rare emphasizing tone in her voice was telling that she was upset, but she held back from explaining further.</p>\n<p>“I don’t care what your excuse is! Do you think I don’t know what you shitty Malikhs up to? You already don’t put Yashura Family in your eyes, eh? Just because you bitch have a little vacation outside, eh? If you think you’re a big shot, why don’t you prove it here and now?!”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh was silent for a while. Looking at Mila, she then asked, “And what are you suggesting I should do, Young Lady Yashura?”</p>\n<p>Mila stabbed her sword into the ground.</p>\n<p>“I just want to know how awesome is this Archer class you’ve got overseas that makes you Malikhs stop putting us Yashuras in your eyes,” Mila sneered. “Why don’t we test it with my sword, eh? Let’s do a duel, bitch.”</p>\n<p>Bhela just looked at Mila strangely.</p>\n<p>“But you’re a Specialist class,” she said.</p>\n<p>“Aha! Getting scared, aren’t ya, you little cunt?”</p>\n<p>Bhela didn’t want to argue with her. So she told the nearest servant to go grab a bow.</p>\n<p>On the other side, Monkey anxiously elbowed Shira, said, “Should I drag your cousin back?”</p>\n<p>“Stand down, mister. Mila is the one who’s starting it. She can’t afford to back down now.”</p>\n<p>Beside them Snake was nodding as he understood what Shira meant.</p>\n<p>Then with a laugh, Good-Natured Spirit, who was already tired jeering him, said to Shira. “Kid, shit just got real. Ain’t that a good idea to pull her before it’s too late?”</p>\n<p>Shira wanted to but he couldn’t. He knew exactly Mila’s strength. Fighting bare hands, she might get a chance to stand against the strongest youngster in the village, but it would become a different story when weapons and mana were involved.</p>\n<p>Since Mila was the one to propose the duel, bailing out before the fight began would be slapping her own face in front of the guests. It was a bad idea, because Mila didn’t appear to have the slightest chance to win. So bad that it’d be more reasonable to just surrender. But Shira knew Mila hated to go back on her words the most. Thus he silently moved closer to her, prepared to pull her back in before the situation really got out of his hands.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Young Master Blackwood, was pulled out by an adjutant of his family.</p>\n<p>Smirking, he asked the adjutant, “Who is that girl who picking a fight with Bhela?”</p>\n<p>“Seems like the eldest young lady of that family,” the adjutant replied.</p>\n<p>“You mean the family my Bhela got engaged to?” Young Master Frane Blackwood asked as if Bhela already his. The corner of his lips curled as he thought this might be a good chance to do something on the engagement that Blackwood House already saw as a thorn in their eyes. “Do you have something on that girl?”</p>\n<p>“Replying to young master, since Yashura Family is the main obstacle for us to get Young Lady Bhela Malikh to our side, your mother has already sent someone to investigate them. The eldest young lady of Yashura Family merely a Level 10 Specialist class who just graduated from Novice about seven months ago.”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood couldn’t help but chuckle. Even though the two young ladies had the same level, a Specialist merely support class that wasn’t suited in combat. This duel affair would turn out to be a joke.</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood scoffed. “Let my Bhela teach her some manners. I don’t want anyone to disturb us after this.”</p>\n<p>“Young master,” the adjutant lowered his voice, “I don’t think that’s a good idea.”</p>\n<p>“What’s on your mind, adjutant?”</p>\n<p>“I just made a round to check the guests attending this ceremony, and I found…”--he lowered his voice--“...some spectators amongst the guests that shouldn’t have be here….”</p>\n<p>“Go on,” the young noble urged.</p>\n<p>“I just received the word, young master, there are experts that Elder Jhamil said he didn’t invite.”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood frowned. “What… what’s that supposed to mean?”</p>\n<p>On the less crowded place of the courtyard, the middle-aged man who Bhela greeted before, along with the middle-aged woman, watched the commotion unfold while nibbling on steamed peanuts. He glanced at the other place where a man calmly sipping tea, a man with a hard face who couldn’t hide his sharp aura, then swept his gaze at the one who beside him, a short stature man who wore a headband to hide his reddish hair from public, who also happened to enjoy steamed peanuts while his focus solely at one direction in the crowd.</p>\n<p>All of them came in common garments incognito. But still Elder Jhamil sent people to keep tabs on them, especially since the bald elder still didn’t know the reason Bhela Malikh invited these foreigners.</p>\n<p>The ngajen ceremony usually consisted of three main parts--prayer, socializing, and sending offerings to the mountain as the finale. It was uncommon for irrelevant events to happen between them. However, since the young lady of the host had already accepted the duel, Malikh Family set up an emergency venue for the fight.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil came to invite himself as the judge. For a change to hummiliate those simple Yashuras and to slip himself onto the spotlight, he couldn’t ask for better opportunity.</p>\n<p>“You two ready?” Elder Jhamil asked both of the opposing sides. “This is a friendly match between two friendly families. So stop before your blade hit your enemy,” he said, seemingly talking to either sides, but didn’t say anything about the arrows part.</p>\n<p>Since Bhela Malikh was an Archer, she suggested to Mila, “I’m using a bow. So you can move first. I’ll try to dodge for ten seconds.”</p>\n<p>“I don’t need that,” Mila scoffed.</p>\n<p>“Very well…” she said. She glanced at Elder Jhamil, said, “Elder Jhamil, please begin the duel.&quot;</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil counted to three.</p>\n<p>The duel began.</p>\n<p>“AAAAAA!!!” Mila roared with the sword raised above her head, charging ahead.</p>\n<p>Contrast to her opponent’s battle cry, Bhela was solemn. She picked four arrows from the quiver tied on her hips. Nocking the arrows simultaneously, she took a deep breath as she concentrated to channel different natures elemental mana from her manasphere. The mana, through fingers and her thumb, flowing into all the four arrows and soon the tip of the arrows glowed with four different colors.</p>\n<p>The wind began to stir.</p>\n<p>And she raised the bow. She released the arrows.</p>\n<p><em>Fuuush fuuuushhh fuuushh shhuuuuusshh!</em></p>\n<p>Before even everyone noticed what happened, the mana Bhela channeled melted the flying arrows, within a span of milliseconds, turning them into dangerous magic projectiles of four elemental natures--fire, water, wind and lightning.</p>\n<p>Mila was confident before. She knew a trick against an Archer, but here she was dumbfounded by magic arrows coming to blast her way. She thought she was fighting an Archer, but got up against a Mage instead. This wasn’t what she signed up for.</p>\n<p><em>Clank!</em></p>\n<p>The first blue arrow dissapeared almost the moment it reached Mila. The sound of metallic clash that followed the said arrow resounded three more times, and the three arrows left behind too disappeared almost immediately. Mila, thought she ought to dodge the magic arrows, leap a step backward, but her hasty movement combined with the slippery mud made her slipped her foothold, accidentally fell to her butt instead.</p>\n<p>Bhela aimed down her bow. Everyone was staring at her with complicated and questioning gaze, as an Archer who could do magic, this was the first time everyone witnessed it.</p>\n<p>“It’s a four elemental affinity spell!” someone’s voice roared through the silenced venue, “I heard it, I doubted it, but she really did it!”</p>\n<p>Everyone looked at his way, the man who shouted, and saw that it was the middle-aged man whom Bhela invited from outside the village. He sat eating steamed peanuts then, now he was standing perplexed.</p>\n<p>Bhela, realizing that the man was the center of the attention, and bow to him from afar.</p>\n<p>“She really did it…” the man said under his breath.</p>\n<p>Someone who sat beside him said, “Sure she did, the only one right now--I guess now that you big brain from Elemental Stone School witnessed it I guess you can die without regret?”</p>\n<p>The man looked at the woman who accompanied him, he said still with expression of disbelieve, “It’s a four elemental affinity spell…”</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, you already said that.”</p>\n<p>The last and the most famous multi elemental Unique Class was, a mage with three elemental affinity skills, died of old age--was actually the headmaster of Elemental Stone School from seventy years ago. As a scholar and a mage researching deeply in topics of elemental mana all of his career, how could he didn’t know the value of a Unique Class who surpassed even the ex-headmaster of his school?</p>\n<p>“I can’t believe someone without a Mage Unique Class really did it…”</p>\n<p>“The most promising talent of this generation, alright, the first time I witnessed an Archer could do magic,” the woman said. “Good thing she stopped her arrows then--if not, the other girl would ended up so pitiful.”</p>\n<p>As the woman said that, someone else blurted not far away from there.</p>\n<p>“She didn’t stop it.”</p>\n<p>“Pardon? Sir Kurusiya?” the woman asked.</p>\n<p>The one she was talking to was the quiet man with sharp aura. He said as a matter of fact like tone, “She didn’t stop it. Someone else did,” he sipped his tea, and when the woman still confused, he explained with hoarse voice, “those are magic, but they were still arrows shot from a bow. You can’t stop flying arrows. That girl calculated and slightly missed her aim as to not hurting her opponent. But she didn’t plan to stop it.”</p>\n<p>The woman questioned him, “If she wasn’t the one who stopped it, then would you know why the arrows disappears?”</p>\n<p>The man put down his glass of tea. “I don’t know. Why you ask me? Ask that fool there who’s been grinning all the time.”</p>\n<p>The woman, along with the middle-aged man from Stone Elemental School, looked up to the bearded foreigner.</p>\n<p>“She’s not the one who stopped it,” the bearded man said with a smile.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Mila, who mellowed from her defeat and still sat on the muddy ground, gulped as she saw her cousin come to pick her up.</p>\n<p>“I lost,” she said to Shira.</p>\n<p>“No you didn’t, that girl is the one who put down her bow first, and you still got your swords in your hands--so technically you’d win.”</p>\n<p>“I fell to my butt, I was humiliated,” Mila said, her voice trembled, “I lost….”</p>\n<p>Shira sighed. He grabbed Mila’s hand and pulled her up. “It’s adult problems from hereon, Uncle Shuro would likely summon my father back. For now, let’s get out of here,” he said.</p>\n<p>Monkey and Snake, along with the nervous Romana, came to follow them from behind to shield them from people’s laughter. Mila was so humiliated the usually feisty tomboy was so down she couldn’t afford to hold her head straight. As Shira witnessed how pitiful his cousin was, regret overwhelming him when he remembered how he was holding back from taking action himself.</p>\n<p>“Brat,” someone called him.</p>\n<p>Shira turned his head. It was Good-Natured Spirit.</p>\n<p>“You owe me this time,” the Nalaq said.</p>\n<p>Shira nodded.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>“Hear ye hear ye people! Gather around and hear me announce something incredible, people! Gather around, will ya!”</p>\n<p>Standing on top of a table, Elder Jhamil shouted to gather people, announcing something that the Young Master of Blackwood Family passed him beforehands. “Although winner of the duel is Young Lady Bhela, Young Master Frane of Blackwood House is concerned by some stupid unruly girl of the supposed biggest family in Badril Village behavior would smear my young lady--”</p>\n<p>“Big news! Big news!” someone else’s shouting cut off Elder Jhamil’s announcement, “Young Master Bonithon is running around beating people! Watch your mouth if you don’t want get beaten for no reason!”</p>\n<p>“Bony is going crazy! He’s going to kick people’s asses! Nobody knows why!”</p>\n<p>“What the fuck is going on! Why Elzhier Family messing with us Malikhs now?”</p>\n<p>At the chaotic scene before him, Elder Jhamil’s face showed a frown and a hint of hesitation. He then cleared his phlegm anyway, trying to get people’s attention, then pushed on announcing carefully, “Young Master Frane Blackwood is concerned that--”</p>\n<p>“Elder Jhamil!!” a servant came running with a horrified expression, “Bony is coming for you, run away!”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil pointed his finger at the servant and roared, “What is that brat from Elzhier Family wants to do with me! Go kick him out, I’m trying to tell everybody something important here!”</p>\n<p>“But he doesn’t listen to reasons! He’s going to punch your face, is what he said just now!”</p>\n<p>“Imbecile! Do you think a young master would jump around like a monkey and punch an elder of another family in the damn face?! He’s making ruckus. Go on, kick him out!”</p>\n<p>Looking at the crowd from the rushedly made stage, he then smiled and continued, “Right, everybody, it’s Young Master of Blackwood Family; what I’m saying is that since Young Lady Bhela Malikh is winning with ease against the foolish young lady of <em>that</em> family, Young Master Blackwood concerned that some people would shrug my young lady’s victory. So he proposed, in order to make it clear the disparity between Malikh and--sheesh--Yashura, he proposed that him as a friendly representative of Malikh Family and Shira Yashura as the repre--”</p>\n<p>“Elder Jhamil--watch out!”</p>\n<p>He had it taking from lowly servants who cut off his announcement. Fuming in anger, Elder Jhamil pointed his finger toward the one who was spriting toward him and roared, “How many times I told you to just kick him out! Shut your trap and go kick the damned brat!”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was losing his cool. But what he failed to realize in time was that the one who sprinted toward him wasn’t a servant from his family. It was not the one who telling him to run away. And before he knew it, someone leaped up on the table where he was standing and delivered a punch to the face.</p>\n<p>“Gaaahhh!”</p>\n<p>Even after Elder Jhamil stumbled down the table he stood on, his assaulter didn’t plan to let him go. And what came after that was a torrent of hardened fist, pummeling his face even though he screamed for mercy. Only when the chaotic crowd succeeded in saving him did Elder Jhamil see the assaulter’s face--it was indeed the Young Master from Elzhier Family.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Bonithon… what did you… why did you do this… for what reason?!” Elder Jhamil choked out his grievance.</p>\n<p>Bony, the man who beat the bald elder black and blue, replied with nothing but a cold stare. Instead, it was an almost incoherent voice of Pilek who answered instead.</p>\n<p>“Kekekek, don’t be angry Elder Baldy! We just discussed how you were a splendid Pugilist a long time ago, so Boss Bony came here to find out whether it was true or not! That’s why he asked you to a barehand duel!” Pilek came in with a swagger and a bottle of booze in his hand. From a single glance anybody could tell he was drunk.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s lips trembled. What duel? That brat just leaped out of nowhere without saying anything, then immediately beating him black and blue!</p>\n<p>The only one from the three delinquents who hadn’t had the smell of liquor from his body was Polio. He wore an apologetic smile, and with a slight sigh, he said, “Please forgive them, dear kind Malikh sirs, my friends are terrible when they are drunk.”</p>\n<p>Polio made a round to apologize to any Malikhs he saw. But the Malikh Family didn’t appreciate his gesture, receiving jeerings in return.</p>\n<p>Polio was a patient young man, but Pilek wasn’t. The drunk Pilek didn’t take their attitude kindly, randomly walking to a servant, said, “Hah? What the fuck are you staring me at, you no-name Malikh servant? Wanna die, eh? Huuuraah!!!”</p>\n<p><em>Shatter!</em></p>\n<p>Without a warning he swung the booze in his hand to a Malikh family servant. The man he attacked stumbled backward holding his bloodied head from the crash Pilek gave him.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Bhela Malikh had just settled greeting four foreign guests that she invited from outside, and was on her way to fetch cuisines from the kitchen to humor her guests, then she witnessed the chaotic brawl unfold with a crowdful of cheers and jeers mixed in between. Perhaps there were more than a dozen men involved, with the Malikhs servants, guards, common family members even an elder came along to surround Bony and his two underlings.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela…” a little maidservant with a crest of Elzhier Family in her uniform bowed to Bhela politely.</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at her. She returned the bow even though the other party clearly was a servant. “Miss Elzhier,” she spoke softly.</p>\n<p>“No need to be polite to this servant, Young Lady.”</p>\n<p>“I can’t be impolite to Sister Ryntia’s friends.”</p>\n<p>The Elzhier Family maidservant smiled. Since Bhela insisted, then she wouldn’t be bowing her head anymore.</p>\n<p>She said, “Eldest Young Lady sends me to ask for your forgiveness for her brother’s brashness, Young Lady Bhela.”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at the brawl that started in her family’s courtyard. This chaos would spell imperfect on tonight's Malikh Family’s Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>“There’s no need for that. Since I accepted Young Lady Mila Yashura’s duel then I somewhat anticipated Young Master Bonithon will follow suit to make trouble tonight. If anything, it is I the one who should apologize to Sister Ryntia because I couldn’t handle the situation well. Please tell her that I’ll try to maintain friendship between Malikh and Elzhier Family.”</p>\n<p>Still with the serene smile on her face, the Elzhier Family maidservant studied the expression on Bhela’s face. She spoke a moment after, “Then I’ll let Eldest Young Lady Elzhier knows by tomorrow.”</p>\n<p>“Thanks,” Bhela offered her gratitude with a bow.</p>\n<p>By this time, the brawl became anything but intensified, as men either from Elzhier Family or thugs that previously had dealings with Bony’s group came in to reinforce the Elzhier young master. Before the Malikhs could pressure the intruders with numbers, but then the completely overwhelmed by the new reinforcement.</p>\n<p>“Huurraaahh!” Pilek sent a Malikh man flying with his kick. “Where the fuck your previous cocky taunt? Cat got your tongue, eh?”</p>\n<p>The only unspoken rules in brawls were strictly no usage of mana and spell as well as no sharp objects to use as weapons. But when it was chaotic and nobody could watch everybody the sharpest mind with tricks the one who prevailed--this is why the likes of Pilek and his friend Polio who always struck in place people wouldn’t be willing the one who were taking the advantage in brawls. Even hunters and seasoned guards were no match against these naughty brats.</p>\n<p>For example, when Pilek’s punch was blocked by Elder Jhamil’s son, “You shitty brat, just wait till I deal with your father--kuukgghh!”</p>\n<p>And because no one was watching, Pilek used his knee to strike the cocky young elder in the balls.</p>\n<p>With a sad whimper from his trembling lips, Elder Jhamil’s son curled onto the ground holding his precious balls that Polio struck.</p>\n<p>Seeing that a family elder was mercilessly defeated, a few Malikhs came to avenge their young elder. By then, Pilek already had Polio watching over his back.</p>\n<p>At that point, no Malikhs could match them in hand-in-hand brawl.</p>\n<p>A stranger then casually walked in. Pilek stopped, looking at him, and amidst the chaotic scene it took a while for him to find out that the man was actually a foreigner--an eastern Kaya man. The man had a sheathed sword on his hips. But Pilek wasn’t afraid as long as he stick with the brawl rules to use only fighting unarmed.</p>\n<p>“Huurraaah!”</p>\n<p>Pilek threw a feint. Most simple Malikhs would fall for this. But the eastern Kaya man didn’t budge. Seemed to even anticipate it. With a movement too fast for Pilek to follow the man grabbed his wrist, flicked him and sent him into the air like it was nothing.</p>\n<p>It was only after Pilek rolled in the mud he realized what had happened.</p>\n<p>The man then glanced aside and walked toward Polio who in his own right was too engrossed with the brawl. With his left hand pushing Polio’s shoulder and the other hand grabbing his wrist, he flipped Polio just like he did Pilek beforehand.</p>\n<p>Pilek and a few others that the man previously flipped were amazed by how effortlessly the man disabling enthusiastic young men from fighting.</p>\n<p>The sword handle the man had was wrapped with cloth and its body too thin for regular blades. Those who noticed this would understand that the man wasn’t an ordinary Kaya. Polio was one of them.</p>\n<p>“A Samurai!” he exclaimed a moment after he got thrown onto the muddy ground.</p>\n<p>The Kaya man stopped, looking at him, then spoke with a displeased tone, “I am but a masterless ronin.”</p>\n<p>The man then continued walking toward a different direction.</p>\n<p>Bony was fighting with three men alone, so he couldn’t afford to look around. He didn’t realize the Kaya man at first, but when the man tried to grab the wild young master’s wrist, Bony reacted--he reacted by throwing a punch to the man’s face.</p>\n<p>The man slapped his flying fist from the side, tremendously muffled its momentum. Again, he tried to grab Bony’s wrist and his shoulder. Bony tried resisting but the man’s speed was too fast for him to compete.</p>\n<p>As the man prepared to flip him, Bony felt a faint gush of the wind from his legs. It didn’t take him a second to realize the man just putting his hand on his shoulder as a feint--his real target was to gently nudge his foot on rooting from the ground, which, if he’d focus his effort to get his shoulder free from the man’s grasp, a small window of opening that could be used by his opponent to disrupt his sense of balance. Thus Bony firmly stomped his feet to the ground instead. He grabbed the man’s sleeve to make his opponent not be able to easily throw like Pilek and Polio.</p>\n<p>Responding to Bony’s choice, the man curled the corner of his lips. Bony caught a hint of taunt when he staring the man in the eyes.</p>\n<p>“Kkuuuggghh!”</p>\n<p>Bony did succeed in preventing himself get flipped to the ground. But he got struck in the gut instead.</p>\n<p>The man didn’t let him go. The moment Bony stepping backward due to shock having stricken, the man was charging and got his wrist in the blink of the eyes--what happened afterward was Bony got his feet swept and he completely lost his ground, and got cheered by his friends as the last man who got thrown into the mud.</p>\n<p>Bony then sat there looking as the fight stopped; since someone took him down, more and less the Malikhs had won the brawl.</p>\n<p>“Aren’t you Thoqek’s son?” the Kaya man asked Bony.</p>\n<p>Bony wasn’t willing to open his mouth when his father’s name got mentioned.</p>\n<p>Receiving no answer, the man thus carelessly said, “Unexpectedly, you’ve got more guts than your father. Get up now, and stop making trouble in Ghalim Malikh’s home.”</p>\n<p>The young ruffians with Bony as the leader naturally wouldn’t be arrogant anymore since they had been defeated. They retreated calmly, and the Malikhs didn’t dare taunt them the second time in case Bony would change his mind and started on a rampage again. In the end, the real reason why Bony came targeting Malikh Family, as many people knew, was that he wasn’t a drinker that would lose reason to punch another family’s elder in the face.</p>\n<p>Speaking about an elder who got a punch in the face; after Bony and others were gone, Elder Jhamil showed his nose out of his hiding place. He gritted his teeth. He swore he’d use his full resource to get back from Bony’s father in the next village council meeting.</p>\n<p>“Elder Jhamil, you still haven’t announced the thing I ask you to do,” from behind, the sullen young noble Frane Blackwood said to him.</p>\n<p>“Y-young Master Blackwood, please spare me--the mood isn’t that good to draw people’s attention after that kid crashing our Ngajen Ceremony just now. How about I brief it to other village leaders tomorrow in the village council meeting?”</p>\n<p>“No, I want everyone to know it by tonight. This is the right time and the right place to announce it. Besides, I want to see what kind of a young man the one who’s supposed to be my rival.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil didn’t want to show his beaten face to the crowd tonight. But as much as he love his face he knew flattery wouldn’t get him out of this situation--at least not if he didn’t want to offend the young noble. And so with a heavy face he climbed the table once again, hiding off his reluctancy.</p>\n<p>Someone heartily made a joke on him, “Elder Jhamil, we thought you’re a man who care about face the most--I don’t expect you to boldly show how handsome you’ve become now!”</p>\n<p>“Kids nowadays getting big headed by their privileges as young masters--naturally I’ll let their fathers know how to discipline their brats!” Elder Jhamil coldly said. “Anyway, you all know that my Young Lady Bhela is a girl with talent and her future is boundless. Here in Malikh Family we’re not willing to throw our princess to cow’s dunk that is Yashura Family’s trash young master. And our friend Young Noble Frane Blackwood also thinks the same!”</p>\n<p>Such passionate speech, naturally people were cheering in anticipation of the next spectacle they thought they were going to witness.</p>\n<p>Getting the cue from Elder Jhamil, Frane Blackwood came forward with a swagger. “I speak this as a close friend of Young Lady Bhela Malikh. Someone with the name of Shira Yashura; if you think you’re worthy of her, do you dare to prove it by having a duel with me?!”</p>\n<p>The crowd was silent. They were waiting for the reply.</p>\n<p>Frane Blackwood swept the crowd with his eyes.</p>\n<p>Someone said to him the boy he challenged was utter trash. He was amused guessing how this trash would respond to his duel challenge, especially when Bhela Malikh had just completely defeated the cheeky young lady from his family.</p>\n<p>There were already murmurs spreading. People were also curious whether Shira was going to accept or run away from it.</p>\n<p>And then…</p>\n<p>“<em>Cough, cough…</em>” someone awkwardly stepped forward with a wry smile plastered on his face. People recognized his face, which looked like a monkey, and many of them had seen him together with Shira Yashura.</p>\n<p>He was Monkey. He said, “This young noble… about your proposed duel… I’m afraid Young Master Shira Yashura can’t answer it tonight.”</p>\n<p>Frane Blackwood laughed. “Why? He’s scared? His cousin challenged Young Lady Bhela to a duel for no apparent reason; don’t tell me we can do the same to them?”</p>\n<p>“No, it’s not that.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil pointed his finger at Monkey. “We all know Shira Yashura is a trash who can’t even advance to Level 4 Novice! Young Master Frane Blackwood is kind. Tonight, he’s going to give Shira one chance to admit that he’s unworthy of Young Lady Bhela Malikh to the crowd here. He does that, and there will be no need for Young Master Frane Blackwood to embarrass him by kicking his ass!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, but he can’t give you an answer tonight,” Monkey insisted.</p>\n<p>Now it was Elder Jhamil who laughed. “He’s really scared facing Young Master Frane right now?!”</p>\n<p>“No…”</p>\n<p>“Then why?”</p>\n<p>Monkey sighed.</p>\n<p>“Because he’s already gone home!”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was furious. The whole point he had to gather people even though his face had been beaten by Bony was to call out the boy and embarrass him in public, as per the young noble request. But the said person himself already went home, so Elder Jhamil standing on top of the table was for nothing.</p>\n<p>Immediately he ordered a servant to send the message to Yashura Family, while in between, cursing the fact that he didn’t get the chance to distract the guests from discussing the previous brawl. Sure enough, not only the people were talking about Bhela Malikh’s hidden Unique Class, they were also talking about Bony, and people he beat to pulp, especially Elder Jhamil. People no longer cared to gossip about Young Lady Mila Yashura who had been sent home defeated, but they laughed at someone present who had just his misfortune like Elder Jhamil instead.</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil had lost his face in the end. Literally and metaphorically.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, with a solemn expression Monkey looked at his partner Snake who was enjoying the banquet and had amused himself watching the spectacle previously.</p>\n<p>Monkey said with a whisper, “Why the hell your family doesn’t show his face when they dumping shit to Young Master and Young Lady Yashura just now?!”</p>\n<p>Snake glanced at him lazily. “I don’t know. They said they were going to diagnose Patriarch Ghalim Malikh previously.”</p>\n<p>“Can’t you just fetch your brother instead? Didn’t you put your words to assure young master before this? What if he thinks we’re people who put our words lightly?”</p>\n<p>“The one who’s diagnosing the patriarch is my grandfather, my brother supposed to be free enough to be a busybody just now,” Snake said, displeased by Monkey’s tone accusing him of being unloyal to his own word.</p>\n<p>Actually, he also confused why his brother didn’t show his nose when Young Lady Mila recklessly brought a sword to challenge Bhela to a duel. From his understanding of his brother’s character and the relationship between his family and Yashura from what he knew told him that more or less his brother was going to back Yashura if the drama with Malikh Family intensified. But he didn’t. Snake would barge into Malikh Family’s doors to look for his grandfather if he knew it was going to be like this instead.</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-6/chapter-5-1":"<authors-note id=\"Radhy\" type=\"danger\">\n<p>I don’t recommend reading from here onwards because the chapter below is still from the previous draft, which is different from the previous 4 chapters. Further edits will be made that most likely makes this chapter quite different than the current one.</p>\n</authors-note>\n<p>In a certain hall in Malikh Family’s left wing complex, four people sat idly on the bamboo mats covered floor. They were being served local-specialty ginger drinks mixed with brown sugar with herbs to drink. There were also some roasted peanuts to chew. Despite they dressed humbly when attending the Ngajen Ceremony, three of them were elders with statuses, while one of them, the sword bearing Kaya man, wasn’t anyone to ignore either.</p>\n<p>Having knowing this, they still waiting for their host, Bhela Malikh, to wrap up the Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>“Still,” Madame Sylvia said after a sip of ginger drink, “I wouldn’t have expected the girl’s talent to be that rare when she approached my sect with the invitation. The top brass only interested of her being the top grade during the seminar thus sent me to check her out. How about you, Mister Harrington?”</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t expecting it either. I only interested when the report said she showed a potential of being two elemental-affinities Archer. Three already great, but with four elementals, chances she’ll get her name down in history books.”</p>\n<p>“That is what happen if she able to live long enough to develop her full potential,” the quiet man with sharp aura remarked. His face was thin, rough, and since he never liked to smile, he always looked like he meant business. The man was role model of eastern Kaya race ancient warriors--stand and sit in straight posture, humorless, and most importantly, always bringing the sharp, thin sword of katana on his hips.</p>\n<p>Madame Sylvia was interested on his remark. So she asked, “Oh, why you think of that, Sir Kurusiya?”</p>\n<p>The eastern man replied, “Because she tangled herself with Blackwood Family,” he paused. “If this Blackwood the same one from this Blackwood guy I know, then it’s definitely a bad news for her.”</p>\n<p>Mister Harrington from Elemental Stone School disagreed.</p>\n<p>“Since when our factions become soft?” he questioned. “We’re not that pitiful to handle some second-rate noble family. Honestly, I think that young man from that Blackwood Family such a pest. If Young Lady Bhela asks for my favor, I’ll handle him cleanly and thoroughly--right here, right now.”</p>\n<p>“I’m not talking about Blackwood Family, I’m talking about the creepy guy with Blackwood as his last name,” Sir Kurusiya said as he put down his ginger drink. He wasn’t happy, so Madame Sylvia signaled Mister Harrington that it best not to continue arguing with the scary eastern Kaya man.</p>\n<p>The hall suddenly turned quiet. Then, the fourth man was happily enjoyed his drink, out of the blue he blurted for his opinion that no one asked for. “That boy from Yashura Family is sure interesting…”</p>\n<p>Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia smiled wryly. Nobody said anything about Yashura Family up until now. The fourth man, Baront Staterwind, came from a very peculiar faction. Which actually had nothing to do with Bhela’s type of talent. Even when he had already came to Badril Village, none would think he accepted Bhela Malikh’s invitation just to scout her talent.</p>\n<p>The hall’s door was knocked. Bhela entered. She politely greeted the four respected guests before she sat down.</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry for the wait, dear elders. Malikh Family hasn’t prepared the best dishes for you during the ceremony, so I asked the best chef we have to cook special meals for you,” Bhela said, then she glanced at the door. “Please enter, aunty!”</p>\n<p>The moment she called, a middle-aged woman who helped Bhela in the kitchen before came with a line of maidservants, bringing freshly cooked dinner meals with them. It was better than what the Malikhs served for the guests before, even compared to the meals served for the family’s important guests cooked by Bhela as the chief chef.</p>\n<p>“I rather you serve me some alcohol,” the eastern Sir Kurusiya said to her.</p>\n<p>Bhela nodded at his request and asked the aunty to fetch the best alcohol she could find. Of course, the best person to get help was the elder who provided Bhela with the hall to host her guests. Bhela hoped the said elder already knew the importance of this meeting thus not being stingy with his alcohol collection.</p>\n<p>“Can we start now, young lady? I don’t have a good alcohol tolerance so I rather get this completed before us adults get to drink,” Madame Sylvia said.</p>\n<p>“We have delicious food here served, Madame Sylvia. To be honest, all the wait before is for the aunties preparing dinner for dear elders,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>But not of the adults believed her words easily.</p>\n<p>“Hoho, you seem so nervous, young lady. You might not look like it, but you seem about to cry,” Sir Baront Staterwind said.</p>\n<p>“Just state what you want from us, don’t waste anymore time,” Sir Kurusiya urged.</p>\n<p>Bhela lowered her head. With her lips tremblingly parted, she said, “As you might know, my father fell ill when I was overseas attending the seminar. My mother has contacted many doctors and alchemists to make medicines for him, yet my father’s condition never improved. I request for elders’ wisdom and strength, please help my poor father, he was in misery for months…”</p>\n<p>Bhela prostated.</p>\n<p>“Please, help me father… he’s dying… please…” she begged.</p>\n<p>Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia exchanged glances. The peculiar beardy man, Sir Baront, merely nodded without letting his thoughts known. Meanwhile, Sir Kurusiya, who didn’t bulge seeing the pretty girl begging in front of him, coldly said, “Well, this is really a waste of time.”</p>\n<p>Hearing the eastern man snorted, Bhela’s heart went cold. She prepared herself bowing down for help, without stating a single offer to prove how desperate herself.</p>\n<p>“And, young lady…” Madame Sylvia asked slowly, “what would you do if someone managed to heal your father?”</p>\n<p>Bhela rose up. She looked straight to Madam Sylvia’s gaze, then said, “Anything,”</p>\n<p>“Anything?”</p>\n<p>“Anything.”</p>\n<p>The room went quiet. Only Mister Harrington’s regretful sigh could be heard.</p>\n<p>It was Sir Baront Staterwind who explained with a good intention, “It really seems you haven’t grasped the situation you were in, young lady. The guest who gave you the gift from before, he’s a young master of a family known as the peerless medicine makers and doctors. If they couldn’t cure your father illness, then I believe no one in this room knows who really can.”</p>\n<p>“If I had a petty mind, young lady, I’d kill for the cosmetic you got from them. That’s how valuable their skills are,” Madam Sylvia said as she shook her head in pity.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh bit her lips. She was eloquent when she invited these experts months ago. Yet tonight, she had completely became tongue-tied and defeated. The cold air suddenly felt more unbearable. Although the warm meals’ delicious aroma wafted through the hall, not a single person had any incentive to touch their food. Everyone in the hall sunken into silence.</p>\n<p>“You want my advice, young lady?” the sharp voice of Sir Kurusiya sliced through the awkward atmosphere. He continued, “Having turned your back against Yashura Family is the dumbest decision you did. I didn’t come here because of you. I know your father, and I certainly know that swordsman from Yashura Family more. It’s a pity I couldn’t meet them today. Really, a complete waste miles and miles of journey.”</p>\n<p>With that, Sir Kurusiya, stood up and prepared to leave.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh quickly swallowed her bitterness, also stood up and said, “Please, Elder Kurusiya, let me see you the way out.”</p>\n<p>“No, don’t,” Sir Kurusiya flatly rejected her offer. “Sit down. These three fogies still haven’t decided what they want to do with you. Better think carefully about what you’re going to say to them next.”</p>\n<p>The eastern man saw himself out. Following his suggestion, Bhela Malikh sat down again and faced the three experts, with her mind suddenly became as blank as a barren field in the corner of abandoned land. She didn’t know what she ought to say to them, seeing the looks of pity they directed at her. Then, just when she managed to regain her bravery to say something, the door slammed open--</p>\n<p>“I come as the representative of Blackwood Family!” Young Master Frane Blackwood boldly yelled.</p>\n<p>He swagered himself in along with Elder Jhamil’s son and the adjutant of Blackwood Family under his wings. The arrogant behaviour of this young noble completely disregard the experts in the room. Madame Sylvia had enough. She dissed him, “What are you doing here uninvited?”</p>\n<p>Instead of the adjutant who usually spoke for his young master, it was the young elder of Malikh Family, Elder Jhamil’s son who replying. “This madam has eyes but doesn’t know what good for her. Of course Young Master Blackwood is invited! He’s the special guest of Malikh Family after all!”</p>\n<p>“What’s your name, boy?” the middle-aged woman hissed.</p>\n<p>“I’m Elder Jhamil’s eldest son! What’s up with you, you don’t have the right to know my name!”</p>\n<p>“Is that it? Very well. It seems just because I respect the southerner custom by dressing commonly you ignorant people already forgot what's best for you. Very well!”</p>\n<p><em>Zziiing!</em></p>\n<p>With a flashing draw of metallic sword, Madame Sylvia stood up to give this ignorant young elder a lesson. But her companion Mister Harrington quickly pulled her back before things really blown up.</p>\n<p>“You brought a weapon with you!” the Elder Jhamil’s son screamed with his finger pointing at Madame Sylvia who already trembling holding back her fury. “Do you not know what’s gonna happen to guests who bring weapons inside their host’s home?”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood rolled his eyes and told his adjutant, “Send this toad out of here, he’s too noisy!”</p>\n<p>“Right away,” the adjutant said. Then with his bony hands, he pulled the screaming Elder Jhamil’s son forcefully.</p>\n<p>“Is the discussion still ongoing?” Frane Blackwood asked the sitting guests as he tightened the blue necktie he wore. He said to Bhela, “Blackwood Family offers a lifetime terms of benefit for you, young lady. Not only medicines, if it boost potion you ask, or equipments, magic items, weapons--you name it, we have all things you’d dare to imagine!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho,” his uninvited offer gave Sir Baront Staterwind a chuckle. The three guests Bhela invited hailed from their own factions, so even if they wanted to rope Bhela in, they would consult with their higher ups about the specific terms they’d give to her as benefits. However, Blackwood Family was, in fact, only a noble family, not an organizational faction, with the only way in was through marriage--so of course the young noble would be able to offer a “lifetime benefits” to her so brazenly.</p>\n<p>“Thank you for holding back your anger, Madame Sylvia,” Bhela completely bowed her head to the angry guest while she completely disregarded Young Master Blackwood’s offers.</p>\n<p>Madame Sylvia nodded. She then looked at Young Master Blackwood and snorted. “Young lady, think carefully about what we said before. Some incapable people only able to spout honey trap to get what they want. Don’t be foolish because your father’s situation.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you for the advice…”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood wanted to argue with this lady. But he also held himself back as he didn’t know the other party’s identity. Therefore, all he could do was haughtily smiling elegantly as a proper noble as he was.</p>\n<p>“Has the discussion already started?” Frane Blackwood asked again. Pity him, not even one interested in answering. Because of that his face became red as he fumed with anger.</p>\n<p>“Ah,” Sir Baront Staterwind looked outside the window and slapped his thigh, “look how late it is! I planned to sleep early because I have something I need to do tomorrow early in the morning!”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh quickly offered to see him till the gate.</p>\n<p>“Hoho, how about you two?” Sir Baront asked the last two foreign experts, the pair of middle-aged man and woman, “overstaying your visit is considering a burden to these good Mossack folks, don’t you think so?”</p>\n<p>“I’m but an ignorant western lady, I know little about the way of the southern people, so please don’t mind us being shameless,” Madame Sylvia said. She then looked at Bhela, “Young Lady Bhela, Mister Harrington and I apparently haven’t booked our place in the village’s inns. We don’t know our talks would turned out dragged this late. For this I have to beg you to let us stay in Malikh Family for a few good days.”</p>\n<p>“Hoho…” Sir Baront Staterwind chuckled as he looked at the poker face pair of experts. Wasn’t the four of them--including Sir Kurusiya, checked in the same inn this afternoon? It was clear Madame Sylvia and Mister Harrington had their own intentions, thus Sir Baront Staterwind shrugged the idea of exposing their little white lies.</p>\n<p>And with that, Bhela Malikh led the three expert guests she invited out of the room. Young Master Blackwood, who was ignored so hard she almost exploded, yelling, “Young Lady Bhela!”</p>\n<p>Bhela turned around. “Yes, Young Master Blackwood?”</p>\n<p>“How about me?”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh blinked. Then she picked a bowl of roasted peanuts and approached him, saying softly, “Please sit down and enjoy this snack. I need to attend to my guests.”</p>\n<p>Hearing her soft, yet slightly cold voice, Young Lady Blackwood the understood something that made him excited, so excited he obediently sat down and nimbled on the roasted peanuts the beautiful Young Lady Bhela gave him.</p>\n<p>Then after Bhela brought the guests out, the Blackwood Family adjutant who was waiting outside came in inside the hall.</p>\n<p>“What are you doing?!” Young Master Blackwood hissed.</p>\n<p>The adjutant gawked. “Young master, I’m here to serve you…”</p>\n<p>“Serve me?” the young master cringed. What a joke! Soon he’d have a time being alone with Young Lady Bhela, and this old man wanted to be here right when he had the chance of his lifetime? What if there--during the discussion--was an accident where he had to be responsible as a man? Would he be happy if the adjutant was here when that happened?</p>\n<p>Absolutely not!</p>\n<p>“Get out! Don’t dawdle around here tonight! I need to discuss an important manner with Young Lady Bhela secretly!”</p>\n<p>“Y-young master--”</p>\n<p>“What are you waiting for! Go back to the inn and don’t bother me till the next morning!”</p>\n<p>The adjutant naturally understood what was inside the young master’s mind. He didn’t dare to linger around. With careful steps, he closed the door and went back to the inn Blackwood Family checked in.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Young Master Blackwood was so excited he couldn’t sit calmly alone in the hall. The thought of having private discussion with a girl as pretty as Bhela Malikh made him thinking a lot of things. Slowly, he getting horny.</p>\n<p>“What is taking her so long?” he mumbled to himself after waiting a fruitless thirty minutes. “Is it maybe she needs to… prepare, herself?”</p>\n<p>If it was going to be her first time, of course she needed time to prepare herself, Young Master Blackwood thought. This young noble had “befriend” and participating in “private discussions” with many experienced women. But virgin girls, he never tasted any.</p>\n<p>Because of that, he willing to wait however much longer for the young lady to prepare herself. And thus, after waiting for another thirty minutes, nothing happened. Nothing happened for the next hour as well. Then, after waiting for nearly three hours alone, the door finally opened…</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela, you finally ready!” Young Master Blackwood snapped out of his sleepy face and excitedly came to greet the visitor. Much to his disappointment, the visitor turned out to be the faithful adjutant.</p>\n<p>“Why is that you?!” Young Master Blackwood roared.</p>\n<p>“Y-young master… let’s get back to the inn,” the adjutant nervously asked.</p>\n<p>“Where’s Young Lady Bhela?”</p>\n<p>“She is in her room…”</p>\n<p>“Then you send someone there to ask her when she’s going to meet me,” the young noble ordered.</p>\n<p>“I’m afraid I can’t… young master…”</p>\n<p>“I’ve been waiting for hours, why?”</p>\n<p>The adjutant gulped before he replied.</p>\n<p>“Because the young lady has already gone sleeping since three hours ago!”</p>\n<p>So much for his dreamy private discussion! Young Master Blackwood was so angry for being misled that he slapped the adjutant’s face all the way back to his inn.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A single torch on a stick stubbornly lit the corner of the village in spite of the strong wind. A howling wolf in the distance reinforced the lone, cold sense of the midnight Badril Village. The only shop that still open at this hours could be counted with one hand, and this liquor shop was one of them. No customer visited it except a foreign eastern Kaya man.</p>\n<p>A series of step could be heard. The sleepy shopkeeper snapped back when he heard a new customer approaching.</p>\n<p>“Give me a glass of <em>tuak</em>, shopkeeper,” the new customer ordered with a booming voice. One could see his beardy feature when his face exposed to the shop’s lantern light. “Mind if I join you, Sir Kurusiya?”</p>\n<p>The eastern man didn’t reply. He drank his alcohol instead.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront Staterwind laughed by his cold treatment. The beardy guy was an easygoing person, so he casually grabbed a bowl of steamed peanuts and started to nibble on those snacks.</p>\n<p>“You’re not visiting Bhela’s father? You said you know him, you know, saying hi to a sick old buddy?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t say hi to a dying man,” Sir Kurusiya said.</p>\n<p>The answer made the air awkward. So Sir Baront quickly came with another topic.</p>\n<p>“It seems those two lovers adamant to protect the girl,” he said, referring to the other two experts who once were couple before Mister Harrington lost Madame Sylvia to another guy. “Or I think they just want some privacy to have some little reunion… who knows?”</p>\n<p>Sir Kurusiya never bothered with petty gossip, he callously replied, “They don’t know Malikh Family. They can’t protect her forever.”</p>\n<p>“Exactly,” Sir Baront Staterwind agreed. After that both men continued drinking without saying anything.</p>\n<p>“Hey shopkeeper,” Sir Baront called, “don’t you have anything with less alcohol? I have a business I’d like to deal with tomorrow, so I want to avoid shitty hangover.”</p>\n<p>“I have some sweet <em>tuak</em>,” the shopkeeper poured a new bottle into Sir Baront’s empty glass, “this one usually for them boys who haven’t gone coming of age ceremony. No alcohol, costs as little as four copper kobe coins.”</p>\n<p>“Four coppers, ah! Why’s that the souther I go the cheaper the drink?” he sipped it, “mm! Pretty good, my good man!”</p>\n<p>He tipped the shopkeeper with a silver coin. The shopkeeper was dumbfounded but quickly recovered and hid the coin safely.</p>\n<p>Sir Kurusiya said to Sir Baront, “You want to go to Yashura Family tomorrow?”</p>\n<p>“How did you know?”</p>\n<p>“Even though I can’t see him, I know the one who repelled Bhela’s arrow was a Nalaq,” Sir Kurusiya said.</p>\n<p>“Hoho, since I managed to rope in the young lady of Yurin Family, I’ve got promoted to an instructor,” Sir Baront smiled widely. “Doing the legwork isn’t my job anymore… but checking him and the boy won’t hurt, so I’m going. Hmm, I wonder if the Nalaq has already form his contract?”</p>\n<p>“Huuh…” the shopkeeper, who had been hearing their chatting, couldn’t help but asked, “you good sir, what’s this talking about a Nalaq having to do with Yashura Family?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, you’re a Yashura?” Sir Baront asked.</p>\n<p>“I’m Elzhier, from the outer family,” the shopkeeper said. “I’ve been in this village for forty years, but never I’ve heard any Nalaq passing by.”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, that’s why I’m going. Usually a rogue Nalaq isn’t someone tied with a faction, so they aren’t that big of deal--which also make them easier to rope in!”</p>\n<p>“Ooohh! Are you a Nalaq expert, mister? From overseas? Our family’s eldest young lady actually was scouted by a passing expert from overseas too, an expert from purple something sect!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, you mean Purple Garden Sect?” Sir Baront Staterwind and asked as he played along.</p>\n<p>But Sir Kurusiya was sceptic. “Purple Garden Sect is too far. And someone from that kind of superpower faction won’t be too idle to accidentally passing by on this kind of rural village.”</p>\n<p>Sir Baront nodded at Sir Kurusiya’s logic. Even if it was that particular sect that accepted the said young lady, both experts wouldn’t be too sure about whether she could be the sect’s legitimate disciple. Their doubts made the shopkeeper embarrassed. Since ten years ago, the tales of the eldest young lady of Elzhier Family being accepted by a foreign expert was a legend amongst Badril Village locals. Except her and the recent Malikh Family’s young lady, no one in the village was lucky got scouted to study oversea, so it became a fact that Elzhier Family was very proud of--and was one of the reasons why the Elzhier could win the village head’s seat from Yashura Family after their decades of leading Badril Village. But the problem was, in the letters their young lady sent home, she always talked about shops, fashions, and some other trivial stuffs that usually young women her age excited about. That made even her father, the current Elzhier Family’s patriarch and the Village Head, felt it was became difficult to still boasting the young lady’s status after ten years of her spending overseas.</p>\n<p>“But still, experts, you might not know this, but our eldest young lady was Young Lady of Malikh Family’s closest childhood friend! When Young Lady Bhela Malikh only a little girl our young lady gave her a lot of pointers and knowledge, so much that I assure that if it wasn’t for her being there for Young Lady Bhela, the Malikh Family wouldn’t get their talented Unique Class for at least the next one hundred years!”</p>\n<p>“Right…” Sir Baront became awkward instantly. To think some ignorant folks believed blessing of Unique Classes was that simple, even Sir Kurusiya scoffed at the idea.</p>\n<p>The shopkeeper’s face became red as he realized it was wise not to delay any longer. So he quickly said, “If you have some spare time, sir experts, I’m sure our Elzhier Family willing to entertain you!”</p>\n<p>After paying for their drinks, even the agreeable Sir Baront Staterwind felt it was very awkward for him to return to this little shop. Both decided not to get themselves involved with Elzhier Family after the shopkeeper’s little salesman talks, whilst not knowing the inn they stayed inn owned by Elzhier Family.</p>\n<p>On the way back, Sir Baront asked Sir Kurusiya for advice.</p>\n<p>“Yo, Kurusiya, I’m going to accept the Yashura boy as my third disciple if the Nalaq’s pretty good. But, you know, the Nalaq who contracted with youngest disciple is a master thirteen thousands years ago. She was a heavy weight figure, so I reckon I’ll let her calls the shot. What’s your opinion on this?”</p>\n<p>“How powerful is this Nalaq you’re talking about?”</p>\n<p>Sir Baront grinned. “You know the legend about Seven Pillars of Tiramikal Continent? She’s the Frost Mage mentioned in that history. Pretty neat, huh? She was able to revive as Nalaq and regained her consciousness five years ago. All the big shots in my Blue Robe Society can’t wait for the girl she’s contracted with to formally accepted into our faction.”</p>\n<p>“If that’s the case then your disciple isn’t necesserily worse than Malikh’s four elemental Archer girl.”</p>\n<p>“So you know why I can’t accept the boy if he’s too crude--I can’t afford to offend this madam Nalaq even the slightest bit.” he took out a bag of roasted peanuts he bought from the shopkeeper, and started to nibble on them. “I’m going to write a letter to my disciples, they’ve been playing around in the neighboring village. This madam Nalaq will come and check the boy herself.”</p>\n<p>Sir Kurusiya abruptly stopped his steps.</p>\n<p>“You want my advice?” he looked straight at Sir Baront’s eyes. “My advice is simple. You’re going to make this madam Nalaq of yours polite and you’re going to beg her to be mindful of her attitude in front of Yashura Family.”</p>\n<p>“You’re joking? You serious?”</p>\n<p>“I’m always serious,” Sir Kurusiya said.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Patriarch of Yashura Family, Shuro Yashura, was exhilarated to see Grandpa Piss and Snotty came to visit the village. One part because he treasured the friendships between their family and Grandpa Piss’s relatives, but mainly, he got to show-off his latest coconut cake recipe.</p>\n<p>“Ah, this is life, drinking <em>tuak</em> when we’re watching the moon, getting drunk while we’re eating coconuts. What a life!” Patriarch Shuro mumbled.</p>\n<p>“What a life indeed,” Grandpa Piss nodded with a low chuckle. On the sky, the full moon was shining bright really beautiful.</p>\n<p>After he’d done his part in ngajen ceremony, Patriarch Shuro Yashura accompanied the old Alchemist and his grandson in a spacious veranda, where they ate coconut cakes and drinking _tuak _while spending time moongazing. They had the Yashura Family’s sole butler, Yulong, to hold the _tuak _bottle and refilled their cups when empty.</p>\n<p>“Grandpa Piss, why didn’t you tell us beforehand before you visit Badril Village? We ran out of <em>rendang</em> before even the ceremony ended, so I’m sorry if you couldn’t eat <em>rendang</em>!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, we already ate chicken curry in Malikh Family, you don’t have to prepare food for us,” Grandpa Piss said.</p>\n<p>“How about breakfast? Are we still have leftover chickens, Yulong?”</p>\n<p>“We still have some leftover grilled village chicken, I’ll talk with the kitchen to reheat two portion first thing in the morning,” Yulong said.</p>\n<p>The Yashura Family’s patriarch was a role model of the stereotype Mossack people. He loved to cook and loved even more to feed people. It was no wonder why southern Mossacks’ visitors always felt welcomed whenever they visited the southern lands.</p>\n<p>“I sent them to bring <em>rendang</em> to Malikh Family, I never expected something like that to happen, hah!” Patriarch Shuro shook his head with a weak smile plastered on his face. During their talk, Grandpa Piss mentioned they met with Shira and Mila, as well mentioned the duel that happened between the two families’ young ladies and the upcoming duel between Shira and the young noble from Blackwood Family. “Whatever, if jerks wanted to fight with us, we won’t back down. Yashura Family never a coward!”</p>\n<p>“I believe Young Master Shira knows what he has to do,” Grandpa Piss assured.</p>\n<p>“I hope so, pity his father never around to hold the sky falling for him,” Patriarch Shuro gulped his <em>tuak</em>. “Anyway, let’s talk about something else. That Ghalim, you checked on him, Grandpa? What’s happened to him?”</p>\n<p>Snotty a little scared when Shuro Yashura suddenly brought up that topic. Snotty glanced at Butler Yulong’s wrinkled face, Yulong smiled back at him. The big muscle man couldn’t help but shuddered inside.</p>\n<p>“Patriarch Ghalim isn’t feeling well after eating some unhygienic food. I already prescribed some medicine for him, but I don’t know when he’d be able to get back at being patriarch since his digestive system was never good.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, is that so? Never knew he had something like that,” Patriarch Shuro mumbled. “There’s this really bad rumor about him being poisoned, Grandpa Piss, we never had something wicked like that in Badril Village.”</p>\n<p>“No, no no no, I can assure you, it’s not poison. I’ve been in the business more than seventy years--it’s <em>not</em> a poison.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss helped Yashura Family a lot when the patriarch’s in-law, Jhuro’s wife, had Shira in her belly. So Patriarch Shuro had long esteemed Grandpa Piss’s medicinal skill, even though he didn’t really had any idea how skillful the friendly old man was. He believed Grandpa Piss in the end.</p>\n<p>“We shouldn’t talk about sad things, Patriarch. Here, I bought a <em>tuak</em> my family handmade ourself. Let’s give it a try,” Grandpa Piss said.</p>\n<p>“Please, let me,” Butler Yulong asked the <em>tuak</em> bottle Grandpa Piss took out and poured it evenly to Patriarch Shuro’s, Grandpa Piss’s, along with Snotty’s glasses.</p>\n<p>The second thing Patriarch Shuro loved, after coconuts, was a strong <em>tuak</em>. He was the first one to gulp his glass clean, and he sighed about how good Grandpa Piss’s family <em>tuak</em> craft was. However, soon after that, his eyes somehow became heavy.</p>\n<p>“Huhh… usually, I still can drink till dawn…” Patriarch Shuro said with a yawn. “Let’s drink together… come on, Snotty, come drink with Uncle Shuro more.”</p>\n<p>“Patriarch, I think you are tired,” Yulong said softly, rejecting to pour patriarch’s glass.</p>\n<p>“Snotty, you go accompany Uncle Shuro inside,” Grandpa Piss said.</p>\n<p>Snotty nodded while still holding his glass full of <em>tuak</em>. The liquor was definitely mixed with something. Considering it was his grandfather who presented it, it was amazing to see Patriarch Shuro Yashura to be able to resist the urge to sleepiness. Snotty stood up and brought the yawning Shuro Yashura away.</p>\n<p>After both of them gone, Yulong picked up a clean glass. He poured the liquor that made Patriarch Shuro sleepy and drank it for himself. Grandpa Piss took out his second bottle and accompanied Yulong drinking <em>tuak</em>.</p>\n<p>“Is there’s something you need to discuss with me?” Yulong asked.</p>\n<p>“Indeed, it’s about Ghalim Malikh’s real condition…” Grandpa Piss didn’t leave any details when he told the Butler Yulong what had really happened in Malikh Family, particularly his discovery about the true nature of poison that made Patriarch Ghalim bedridden.</p>\n<p>When he heard that shocking fact, there was no surprise in the butler’s old face. Only sorrow and regret.</p>\n<p>“I knew this would happened,” Yulong sighed.</p>\n<p>“Then there’s Blackwood Family too…” Grandpa Piss’s sigh followed. “They seems interested in taking away Young Lady Bhela as a bride… I really don’t know what to say…”</p>\n<p>Yulong drank the <em>tuak</em> and told Grandpa Piss his reasoning, “That boy from Blackwood Family still hasn’t accepted Sir Jhuro’s decission to retire sixteen years ago. He’s been keeping quiet because he knew even the royalty and the organization behind him couldn’t protect him from Old Sir Lharu’s and Old Madam Sari’s retrubution. Time’s change. I reckon there’s some change somewhere that make him cocky.”</p>\n<p>“Old Sir and Old Madam too far away to give help in case something like this happens suddenly. Should I help you and Sir Jhuro keeping tabs on Blackwood Family?” Grandpa Piss asked.</p>\n<p>While Jhuro Yashura left behind resources and men outside before he retired, he almost never interacted with the high society of nobility. For ears and eyes to reach those fancy places, it would take time and efforts for current Yulong and Shuro Yashura to do so. It was way better to ask Grandpa Piss who already familiar due to his family’s generations of Alchemist profession. However, Yulong rejected the offer without giving it a real thought.</p>\n<p>“You don’t need to worry. Blackwood Family only taking a ride of that boy’s ambition. If he really supports his foster family right from the start, Blackwood won’t be stuck with their viscount nobility rank.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss wanted to offer any more help, but he long sensed the old butler’s distrust of him on affairs that didn’t include medicines and elixirs. So he kept his mouth shut for the time being.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, a golden owl landed on the veranda where the two old men enjoyed their <em>tuak</em>. The own brought a small piece of paper and inked quill with it.</p>\n<p>“Go, send this message to Sir Jhuro, as fast as possible!” Butler Yulong said to the owl after he wrote his tiny letter. Then he glanced at Grandpa Piss and said, “this is an owl I keep around in case there’s an emergency. Sir Jhuro also brought one with him.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss nodded with a painful smile. This golden owl was long thought to be extinct, but the reality there were small amounts of them were being kept in case of emergencies. They were rare, almost becoming birds of legend. Small to medium sized kingdoms wouldn’t dare to think getting their hands on it, not to mention Grandpa Piss’s own family. But this old butler had one with him. And the prodigial man of Yashura Family casually brought this treasure bird with him to travel around the southern land.</p>\n<p>“This is really for emergency,” Yulong said coldly, knowing full well the old Alchemist’s envy.</p>\n<p>“I know, I know--for emergency.”</p>\n<p>The owl then flew away bringing Yulong’s letter.</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss and Snotty returned back to their own village the next morning. After sending them away, Yulong found out the young master, Shira Yashura, wanted to go to the market to pick some goods for his contracted pedlers to sell. He was worried the young master’s inexperience getting him exploited. Therefore, he waited in the gate and followed the boy from behind.</p>\n<p>In front of an inn owned by Elzhier Family, Yulong saw a familiar eastern Kaya man came out with a respectable, but humble Mossack man behind him. The Kaya man, Sir Kurusiya, noticed Yulong, immediately cupped his fist and bowed his body. That was a salute of great respect eastern Kaya men usually give to people they regard highly. Sir Baront Staterwind didn’t know what was going on, so he imitated his companion to salute Yulong even though he didn’t really know he was only a butler.</p>\n<p>“You know them, Yulong?” Shira asked.</p>\n<p>“The Kaya man once works in the same place as your father, young master.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, that’s why you know him.” Yulong was his mother helper, and his father brought him along to Yashura Family when Shira still in his mother’s belly. Shira never liked to listen about his father’s past, even though it was often glorified since he was completely stopped marauding bandits from approaching Badril Village. Walking toward the market, Shira kept quiet and didn’t ask the matter any further.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Far away from Badril Village, the golden owl Yulong tasked with the emergency letter flew through walls of mist and mountains. It instinctively knew the location of its recipient, Jhuro Yashura, even though Yulong wasn’t necesserarily knew where he was. Not even a half day passed by since the bird took off from Yashura Family, it flew already more than halfway toward its destination.</p>\n<p>Its speed was unprecendeted amongst the magical beast. No wonder commonfolks thought it was the bird of the legend. It was a shame that it failed to detect a single flash on the horizon, resulting it to succumb to a terrible fate.</p>\n<p><em>Flap flap flap!</em></p>\n<p>The owl futilely tried to avoid danger.</p>\n<p>A single flash all it took to capture the dumbfounded owl. A pair of cold talons gripped its short neck and the next thing it knew, the owl panically flapping its wings in search of oxygen, only to be deprived of fresh air even more. The owl couldn’t see the beast, it only saw a dashingly crimson flash before it was captured by the neck. The hostile beast scretched, only after that the owl realized a damned predator eagle already got it. Annoyed by the owl’s desperate struggle, the eagle broke its neck. The handsome crimson-colored eagle then delivered the dead owl to a mysterious masked man, who then passed it to another man--a pale, thin man who only dressed himself as black as the phantom itself.</p>\n<p>“This owl coming out from Yashura Family, Mister Blackwood. The bird brings a letter with it,” the masked man said as he presented the letter to the pale man.</p>\n<p>“Ah, so they figured it out about the poison,” the pale man with Blackwood surname said. Beside him and the masked man, there was a third man who drained the blood of the golden owl, prepared a little feast of its dead body. The man was very peculiar; bald, with veined oversized muscles that looked like it was almost exploded, and the strange tatooes that covered its body. He was a northern barbarian, the kind that never took orders from civilized men no matter they came from the west, south, or the east. Yet, when the Blackwood guy told him top plucking the dead owl, he obidiently put aside the carcass, not daring to show any hints of disatisfaction.</p>\n<p>“Mister, the young lady of Malikh Family turns out to be a four-elemental Unique Class, she’s a real talent with tremendous potential--your sister tries to take her to Blackwood Family and having a setback because there’s some experts happened to visit Malikh Family. Shall we send anymore resources to help her?”</p>\n<p>“What’s her Blackwood Family have to do with me? It’s already good enough I let her to use my name to coerce people and strengthen her influence in commerce world. She’s getting annoying every time she’s using my toys. That Jhuju’s poison I sent to her only a reminder to Ghalim of our old friendship, my sister should be thankful enough if she gets some benefits from it.”</p>\n<p>The masked man knew the pale man was irritated by his sister’s cockiness. So he excused himself and brought the crimson eagle with him, disappearing into the shadow.</p>\n<p>“We’ve rested enough,” the pale man said as he crumbled the small letter he read. The bald barbarian’s head cocked and he await the order. “Prepare the horses,” the man continued, “I’ve got an old friend I should say hi to.”</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-6/chapter-5":"<authors-note id=\"Radhy\" type=\"danger\">\n<p>I don’t recommend reading from here onwards because the chapter below is still from the previous draft, which is different from the previous 4 chapters. Further edits will be made that most likely makes this chapter quite different than the current one.</p>\n</authors-note>\n<p>In a certain hall in Malikh Family’s left wing complex, four people sat idly on the bamboo mats covered floor. They were being served local-specialty ginger drinks mixed with brown sugar with herbs to drink. There were also some roasted peanuts to chew. Despite they dressed humbly when attending the Ngajen Ceremony, three of them were elders with statuses, while one of them, the sword bearing Kaya man, wasn’t anyone to ignore either.</p>\n<p>Having knowing this, they still waiting for their host, Bhela Malikh, to wrap up the Ngajen Ceremony.</p>\n<p>“Still,” Madame Sylvia said after a sip of ginger drink, “I wouldn’t have expected the girl’s talent to be that rare when she approached my sect with the invitation. The top brass only interested of her being the top grade during the seminar thus sent me to check her out. How about you, Mister Harrington?”</p>\n<p>“I wasn’t expecting it either. I only interested when the report said she showed a potential of being two elemental-affinities Archer. Three already great, but with four elementals, chances she’ll get her name down in history books.”</p>\n<p>“That is what happen if she able to live long enough to develop her full potential,” the quiet man with sharp aura remarked. His face was thin, rough, and since he never liked to smile, he always looked like he meant business. The man was role model of eastern Kaya race ancient warriors--stand and sit in straight posture, humorless, and most importantly, always bringing the sharp, thin sword of katana on his hips.</p>\n<p>Madame Sylvia was interested on his remark. So she asked, “Oh, why you think of that, Sir Kurusiya?”</p>\n<p>The eastern man replied, “Because she tangled herself with Blackwood Family,” he paused. “If this Blackwood the same one from this Blackwood guy I know, then it’s definitely a bad news for her.”</p>\n<p>Mister Harrington from Elemental Stone School disagreed.</p>\n<p>“Since when our factions become soft?” he questioned. “We’re not that pitiful to handle some second-rate noble family. Honestly, I think that young man from that Blackwood Family such a pest. If Young Lady Bhela asks for my favor, I’ll handle him cleanly and thoroughly--right here, right now.”</p>\n<p>“I’m not talking about Blackwood Family, I’m talking about the creepy guy with Blackwood as his last name,” Sir Kurusiya said as he put down his ginger drink. He wasn’t happy, so Madame Sylvia signaled Mister Harrington that it best not to continue arguing with the scary eastern Kaya man.</p>\n<p>The hall suddenly turned quiet. Then, the fourth man was happily enjoyed his drink, out of the blue he blurted for his opinion that no one asked for. “That boy from Yashura Family is sure interesting…”</p>\n<p>Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia smiled wryly. Nobody said anything about Yashura Family up until now. The fourth man, Baront Staterwind, came from a very peculiar faction. Which actually had nothing to do with Bhela’s type of talent. Even when he had already came to Badril Village, none would think he accepted Bhela Malikh’s invitation just to scout her talent.</p>\n<p>The hall’s door was knocked. Bhela entered. She politely greeted the four respected guests before she sat down.</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry for the wait, dear elders. Malikh Family hasn’t prepared the best dishes for you during the ceremony, so I asked the best chef we have to cook special meals for you,” Bhela said, then she glanced at the door. “Please enter, aunty!”</p>\n<p>The moment she called, a middle-aged woman who helped Bhela in the kitchen before came with a line of maidservants, bringing freshly cooked dinner meals with them. It was better than what the Malikhs served for the guests before, even compared to the meals served for the family’s important guests cooked by Bhela as the chief chef.</p>\n<p>“I rather you serve me some alcohol,” the eastern Sir Kurusiya said to her.</p>\n<p>Bhela nodded at his request and asked the aunty to fetch the best alcohol she could find. Of course, the best person to get help was the elder who provided Bhela with the hall to host her guests. Bhela hoped the said elder already knew the importance of this meeting thus not being stingy with his alcohol collection.</p>\n<p>“Can we start now, young lady? I don’t have a good alcohol tolerance so I rather get this completed before us adults get to drink,” Madame Sylvia said.</p>\n<p>“We have delicious food here served, Madame Sylvia. To be honest, all the wait before is for the aunties preparing dinner for dear elders,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>But not of the adults believed her words easily.</p>\n<p>“Hoho, you seem so nervous, young lady. You might not look like it, but you seem about to cry,” Sir Baront Staterwind said.</p>\n<p>“Just state what you want from us, don’t waste anymore time,” Sir Kurusiya urged.</p>\n<p>Bhela lowered her head. With her lips tremblingly parted, she said, “As you might know, my father fell ill when I was overseas attending the seminar. My mother has contacted many doctors and alchemists to make medicines for him, yet my father’s condition never improved. I request for elders’ wisdom and strength, please help my poor father, he was in misery for months…”</p>\n<p>Bhela prostated.</p>\n<p>“Please, help me father… he’s dying… please…” she begged.</p>\n<p>Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia exchanged glances. The peculiar beardy man, Sir Baront, merely nodded without letting his thoughts known. Meanwhile, Sir Kurusiya, who didn’t bulge seeing the pretty girl begging in front of him, coldly said, “Well, this is really a waste of time.”</p>\n<p>Hearing the eastern man snorted, Bhela’s heart went cold. She prepared herself bowing down for help, without stating a single offer to prove how desperate herself.</p>\n<p>“And, young lady…” Madame Sylvia asked slowly, “what would you do if someone managed to heal your father?”</p>\n<p>Bhela rose up. She looked straight to Madam Sylvia’s gaze, then said, “Anything,”</p>\n<p>“Anything?”</p>\n<p>“Anything.”</p>\n<p>The room went quiet. Only Mister Harrington’s regretful sigh could be heard.</p>\n<p>It was Sir Baront Staterwind who explained with a good intention, “It really seems you haven’t grasped the situation you were in, young lady. The guest who gave you the gift from before, he’s a young master of a family known as the peerless medicine makers and doctors. If they couldn’t cure your father illness, then I believe no one in this room knows who really can.”</p>\n<p>“If I had a petty mind, young lady, I’d kill for the cosmetic you got from them. That’s how valuable their skills are,” Madam Sylvia said as she shook her head in pity.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh bit her lips. She was eloquent when she invited these experts months ago. Yet tonight, she had completely became tongue-tied and defeated. The cold air suddenly felt more unbearable. Although the warm meals’ delicious aroma wafted through the hall, not a single person had any incentive to touch their food. Everyone in the hall sunken into silence.</p>\n<p>“You want my advice, young lady?” the sharp voice of Sir Kurusiya sliced through the awkward atmosphere. He continued, “Having turned your back against Yashura Family is the dumbest decision you did. I didn’t come here because of you. I know your father, and I certainly know that swordsman from Yashura Family more. It’s a pity I couldn’t meet them today. Really, a complete waste miles and miles of journey.”</p>\n<p>With that, Sir Kurusiya, stood up and prepared to leave.</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh quickly swallowed her bitterness, also stood up and said, “Please, Elder Kurusiya, let me see you the way out.”</p>\n<p>“No, don’t,” Sir Kurusiya flatly rejected her offer. “Sit down. These three fogies still haven’t decided what they want to do with you. Better think carefully about what you’re going to say to them next.”</p>\n<p>The eastern man saw himself out. Following his suggestion, Bhela Malikh sat down again and faced the three experts, with her mind suddenly became as blank as a barren field in the corner of abandoned land. She didn’t know what she ought to say to them, seeing the looks of pity they directed at her. Then, just when she managed to regain her bravery to say something, the door slammed open--</p>\n<p>“I come as the representative of Blackwood Family!” Young Master Frane Blackwood boldly yelled.</p>\n<p>He swagered himself in along with Elder Jhamil’s son and the adjutant of Blackwood Family under his wings. The arrogant behaviour of this young noble completely disregard the experts in the room. Madame Sylvia had enough. She dissed him, “What are you doing here uninvited?”</p>\n<p>Instead of the adjutant who usually spoke for his young master, it was the young elder of Malikh Family, Elder Jhamil’s son who replying. “This madam has eyes but doesn’t know what good for her. Of course Young Master Blackwood is invited! He’s the special guest of Malikh Family after all!”</p>\n<p>“What’s your name, boy?” the middle-aged woman hissed.</p>\n<p>“I’m Elder Jhamil’s eldest son! What’s up with you, you don’t have the right to know my name!”</p>\n<p>“Is that it? Very well. It seems just because I respect the southerner custom by dressing commonly you ignorant people already forgot what's best for you. Very well!”</p>\n<p><em>Zziiing!</em></p>\n<p>With a flashing draw of metallic sword, Madame Sylvia stood up to give this ignorant young elder a lesson. But her companion Mister Harrington quickly pulled her back before things really blown up.</p>\n<p>“You brought a weapon with you!” the Elder Jhamil’s son screamed with his finger pointing at Madame Sylvia who already trembling holding back her fury. “Do you not know what’s gonna happen to guests who bring weapons inside their host’s home?”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood rolled his eyes and told his adjutant, “Send this toad out of here, he’s too noisy!”</p>\n<p>“Right away,” the adjutant said. Then with his bony hands, he pulled the screaming Elder Jhamil’s son forcefully.</p>\n<p>“Is the discussion still ongoing?” Frane Blackwood asked the sitting guests as he tightened the blue necktie he wore. He said to Bhela, “Blackwood Family offers a lifetime terms of benefit for you, young lady. Not only medicines, if it boost potion you ask, or equipments, magic items, weapons--you name it, we have all things you’d dare to imagine!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho,” his uninvited offer gave Sir Baront Staterwind a chuckle. The three guests Bhela invited hailed from their own factions, so even if they wanted to rope Bhela in, they would consult with their higher ups about the specific terms they’d give to her as benefits. However, Blackwood Family was, in fact, only a noble family, not an organizational faction, with the only way in was through marriage--so of course the young noble would be able to offer a “lifetime benefits” to her so brazenly.</p>\n<p>“Thank you for holding back your anger, Madame Sylvia,” Bhela completely bowed her head to the angry guest while she completely disregarded Young Master Blackwood’s offers.</p>\n<p>Madame Sylvia nodded. She then looked at Young Master Blackwood and snorted. “Young lady, think carefully about what we said before. Some incapable people only able to spout honey trap to get what they want. Don’t be foolish because your father’s situation.”</p>\n<p>“Thank you for the advice…”</p>\n<p>Young Master Blackwood wanted to argue with this lady. But he also held himself back as he didn’t know the other party’s identity. Therefore, all he could do was haughtily smiling elegantly as a proper noble as he was.</p>\n<p>“Has the discussion already started?” Frane Blackwood asked again. Pity him, not even one interested in answering. Because of that his face became red as he fumed with anger.</p>\n<p>“Ah,” Sir Baront Staterwind looked outside the window and slapped his thigh, “look how late it is! I planned to sleep early because I have something I need to do tomorrow early in the morning!”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh quickly offered to see him till the gate.</p>\n<p>“Hoho, how about you two?” Sir Baront asked the last two foreign experts, the pair of middle-aged man and woman, “overstaying your visit is considering a burden to these good Mossack folks, don’t you think so?”</p>\n<p>“I’m but an ignorant western lady, I know little about the way of the southern people, so please don’t mind us being shameless,” Madame Sylvia said. She then looked at Bhela, “Young Lady Bhela, Mister Harrington and I apparently haven’t booked our place in the village’s inns. We don’t know our talks would turned out dragged this late. For this I have to beg you to let us stay in Malikh Family for a few good days.”</p>\n<p>“Hoho…” Sir Baront Staterwind chuckled as he looked at the poker face pair of experts. Wasn’t the four of them--including Sir Kurusiya, checked in the same inn this afternoon? It was clear Madame Sylvia and Mister Harrington had their own intentions, thus Sir Baront Staterwind shrugged the idea of exposing their little white lies.</p>\n<p>And with that, Bhela Malikh led the three expert guests she invited out of the room. Young Master Blackwood, who was ignored so hard she almost exploded, yelling, “Young Lady Bhela!”</p>\n<p>Bhela turned around. “Yes, Young Master Blackwood?”</p>\n<p>“How about me?”</p>\n<p>Bhela Malikh blinked. Then she picked a bowl of roasted peanuts and approached him, saying softly, “Please sit down and enjoy this snack. I need to attend to my guests.”</p>\n<p>Hearing her soft, yet slightly cold voice, Young Lady Blackwood the understood something that made him excited, so excited he obediently sat down and nimbled on the roasted peanuts the beautiful Young Lady Bhela gave him.</p>\n<p>Then after Bhela brought the guests out, the Blackwood Family adjutant who was waiting outside came in inside the hall.</p>\n<p>“What are you doing?!” Young Master Blackwood hissed.</p>\n<p>The adjutant gawked. “Young master, I’m here to serve you…”</p>\n<p>“Serve me?” the young master cringed. What a joke! Soon he’d have a time being alone with Young Lady Bhela, and this old man wanted to be here right when he had the chance of his lifetime? What if there--during the discussion--was an accident where he had to be responsible as a man? Would he be happy if the adjutant was here when that happened?</p>\n<p>Absolutely not!</p>\n<p>“Get out! Don’t dawdle around here tonight! I need to discuss an important manner with Young Lady Bhela secretly!”</p>\n<p>“Y-young master--”</p>\n<p>“What are you waiting for! Go back to the inn and don’t bother me till the next morning!”</p>\n<p>The adjutant naturally understood what was inside the young master’s mind. He didn’t dare to linger around. With careful steps, he closed the door and went back to the inn Blackwood Family checked in.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Young Master Blackwood was so excited he couldn’t sit calmly alone in the hall. The thought of having private discussion with a girl as pretty as Bhela Malikh made him thinking a lot of things. Slowly, he getting horny.</p>\n<p>“What is taking her so long?” he mumbled to himself after waiting a fruitless thirty minutes. “Is it maybe she needs to… prepare, herself?”</p>\n<p>If it was going to be her first time, of course she needed time to prepare herself, Young Master Blackwood thought. This young noble had “befriend” and participating in “private discussions” with many experienced women. But virgin girls, he never tasted any.</p>\n<p>Because of that, he willing to wait however much longer for the young lady to prepare herself. And thus, after waiting for another thirty minutes, nothing happened. Nothing happened for the next hour as well. Then, after waiting for nearly three hours alone, the door finally opened…</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela, you finally ready!” Young Master Blackwood snapped out of his sleepy face and excitedly came to greet the visitor. Much to his disappointment, the visitor turned out to be the faithful adjutant.</p>\n<p>“Why is that you?!” Young Master Blackwood roared.</p>\n<p>“Y-young master… let’s get back to the inn,” the adjutant nervously asked.</p>\n<p>“Where’s Young Lady Bhela?”</p>\n<p>“She is in her room…”</p>\n<p>“Then you send someone there to ask her when she’s going to meet me,” the young noble ordered.</p>\n<p>“I’m afraid I can’t… young master…”</p>\n<p>“I’ve been waiting for hours, why?”</p>\n<p>The adjutant gulped before he replied.</p>\n<p>“Because the young lady has already gone sleeping since three hours ago!”</p>\n<p>So much for his dreamy private discussion! Young Master Blackwood was so angry for being misled that he slapped the adjutant’s face all the way back to his inn.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>A single torch on a stick stubbornly lit the corner of the village in spite of the strong wind. A howling wolf in the distance reinforced the lone, cold sense of the midnight Badril Village. The only shop that still open at this hours could be counted with one hand, and this liquor shop was one of them. No customer visited it except a foreign eastern Kaya man.</p>\n<p>A series of step could be heard. The sleepy shopkeeper snapped back when he heard a new customer approaching.</p>\n<p>“Give me a glass of <em>tuak</em>, shopkeeper,” the new customer ordered with a booming voice. One could see his beardy feature when his face exposed to the shop’s lantern light. “Mind if I join you, Sir Kurusiya?”</p>\n<p>The eastern man didn’t reply. He drank his alcohol instead.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront Staterwind laughed by his cold treatment. The beardy guy was an easygoing person, so he casually grabbed a bowl of steamed peanuts and started to nibble on those snacks.</p>\n<p>“You’re not visiting Bhela’s father? You said you know him, you know, saying hi to a sick old buddy?”</p>\n<p>“I don’t say hi to a dying man,” Sir Kurusiya said.</p>\n<p>The answer made the air awkward. So Sir Baront quickly came with another topic.</p>\n<p>“It seems those two lovers adamant to protect the girl,” he said, referring to the other two experts who once were couple before Mister Harrington lost Madame Sylvia to another guy. “Or I think they just want some privacy to have some little reunion… who knows?”</p>\n<p>Sir Kurusiya never bothered with petty gossip, he callously replied, “They don’t know Malikh Family. They can’t protect her forever.”</p>\n<p>“Exactly,” Sir Baront Staterwind agreed. After that both men continued drinking without saying anything.</p>\n<p>“Hey shopkeeper,” Sir Baront called, “don’t you have anything with less alcohol? I have a business I’d like to deal with tomorrow, so I want to avoid shitty hangover.”</p>\n<p>“I have some sweet <em>tuak</em>,” the shopkeeper poured a new bottle into Sir Baront’s empty glass, “this one usually for them boys who haven’t gone coming of age ceremony. No alcohol, costs as little as four copper kobe coins.”</p>\n<p>“Four coppers, ah! Why’s that the souther I go the cheaper the drink?” he sipped it, “mm! Pretty good, my good man!”</p>\n<p>He tipped the shopkeeper with a silver coin. The shopkeeper was dumbfounded but quickly recovered and hid the coin safely.</p>\n<p>Sir Kurusiya said to Sir Baront, “You want to go to Yashura Family tomorrow?”</p>\n<p>“How did you know?”</p>\n<p>“Even though I can’t see him, I know the one who repelled Bhela’s arrow was a Nalaq,” Sir Kurusiya said.</p>\n<p>“Hoho, since I managed to rope in the young lady of Yurin Family, I’ve got promoted to an instructor,” Sir Baront smiled widely. “Doing the legwork isn’t my job anymore… but checking him and the boy won’t hurt, so I’m going. Hmm, I wonder if the Nalaq has already form his contract?”</p>\n<p>“Huuh…” the shopkeeper, who had been hearing their chatting, couldn’t help but asked, “you good sir, what’s this talking about a Nalaq having to do with Yashura Family?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, you’re a Yashura?” Sir Baront asked.</p>\n<p>“I’m Elzhier, from the outer family,” the shopkeeper said. “I’ve been in this village for forty years, but never I’ve heard any Nalaq passing by.”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, that’s why I’m going. Usually a rogue Nalaq isn’t someone tied with a faction, so they aren’t that big of deal--which also make them easier to rope in!”</p>\n<p>“Ooohh! Are you a Nalaq expert, mister? From overseas? Our family’s eldest young lady actually was scouted by a passing expert from overseas too, an expert from purple something sect!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, you mean Purple Garden Sect?” Sir Baront Staterwind and asked as he played along.</p>\n<p>But Sir Kurusiya was sceptic. “Purple Garden Sect is too far. And someone from that kind of superpower faction won’t be too idle to accidentally passing by on this kind of rural village.”</p>\n<p>Sir Baront nodded at Sir Kurusiya’s logic. Even if it was that particular sect that accepted the said young lady, both experts wouldn’t be too sure about whether she could be the sect’s legitimate disciple. Their doubts made the shopkeeper embarrassed. Since ten years ago, the tales of the eldest young lady of Elzhier Family being accepted by a foreign expert was a legend amongst Badril Village locals. Except her and the recent Malikh Family’s young lady, no one in the village was lucky got scouted to study oversea, so it became a fact that Elzhier Family was very proud of--and was one of the reasons why the Elzhier could win the village head’s seat from Yashura Family after their decades of leading Badril Village. But the problem was, in the letters their young lady sent home, she always talked about shops, fashions, and some other trivial stuffs that usually young women her age excited about. That made even her father, the current Elzhier Family’s patriarch and the Village Head, felt it was became difficult to still boasting the young lady’s status after ten years of her spending overseas.</p>\n<p>“But still, experts, you might not know this, but our eldest young lady was Young Lady of Malikh Family’s closest childhood friend! When Young Lady Bhela Malikh only a little girl our young lady gave her a lot of pointers and knowledge, so much that I assure that if it wasn’t for her being there for Young Lady Bhela, the Malikh Family wouldn’t get their talented Unique Class for at least the next one hundred years!”</p>\n<p>“Right…” Sir Baront became awkward instantly. To think some ignorant folks believed blessing of Unique Classes was that simple, even Sir Kurusiya scoffed at the idea.</p>\n<p>The shopkeeper’s face became red as he realized it was wise not to delay any longer. So he quickly said, “If you have some spare time, sir experts, I’m sure our Elzhier Family willing to entertain you!”</p>\n<p>After paying for their drinks, even the agreeable Sir Baront Staterwind felt it was very awkward for him to return to this little shop. Both decided not to get themselves involved with Elzhier Family after the shopkeeper’s little salesman talks, whilst not knowing the inn they stayed inn owned by Elzhier Family.</p>\n<p>On the way back, Sir Baront asked Sir Kurusiya for advice.</p>\n<p>“Yo, Kurusiya, I’m going to accept the Yashura boy as my third disciple if the Nalaq’s pretty good. But, you know, the Nalaq who contracted with youngest disciple is a master thirteen thousands years ago. She was a heavy weight figure, so I reckon I’ll let her calls the shot. What’s your opinion on this?”</p>\n<p>“How powerful is this Nalaq you’re talking about?”</p>\n<p>Sir Baront grinned. “You know the legend about Seven Pillars of Tiramikal Continent? She’s the Frost Mage mentioned in that history. Pretty neat, huh? She was able to revive as Nalaq and regained her consciousness five years ago. All the big shots in my Blue Robe Society can’t wait for the girl she’s contracted with to formally accepted into our faction.”</p>\n<p>“If that’s the case then your disciple isn’t necesserily worse than Malikh’s four elemental Archer girl.”</p>\n<p>“So you know why I can’t accept the boy if he’s too crude--I can’t afford to offend this madam Nalaq even the slightest bit.” he took out a bag of roasted peanuts he bought from the shopkeeper, and started to nibble on them. “I’m going to write a letter to my disciples, they’ve been playing around in the neighboring village. This madam Nalaq will come and check the boy herself.”</p>\n<p>Sir Kurusiya abruptly stopped his steps.</p>\n<p>“You want my advice?” he looked straight at Sir Baront’s eyes. “My advice is simple. You’re going to make this madam Nalaq of yours polite and you’re going to beg her to be mindful of her attitude in front of Yashura Family.”</p>\n<p>“You’re joking? You serious?”</p>\n<p>“I’m always serious,” Sir Kurusiya said.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Patriarch of Yashura Family, Shuro Yashura, was exhilarated to see Grandpa Piss and Snotty came to visit the village. One part because he treasured the friendships between their family and Grandpa Piss’s relatives, but mainly, he got to show-off his latest coconut cake recipe.</p>\n<p>“Ah, this is life, drinking <em>tuak</em> when we’re watching the moon, getting drunk while we’re eating coconuts. What a life!” Patriarch Shuro mumbled.</p>\n<p>“What a life indeed,” Grandpa Piss nodded with a low chuckle. On the sky, the full moon was shining bright really beautiful.</p>\n<p>After he’d done his part in ngajen ceremony, Patriarch Shuro Yashura accompanied the old Alchemist and his grandson in a spacious veranda, where they ate coconut cakes and drinking _tuak _while spending time moongazing. They had the Yashura Family’s sole butler, Yulong, to hold the _tuak _bottle and refilled their cups when empty.</p>\n<p>“Grandpa Piss, why didn’t you tell us beforehand before you visit Badril Village? We ran out of <em>rendang</em> before even the ceremony ended, so I’m sorry if you couldn’t eat <em>rendang</em>!”</p>\n<p>“Hoho, we already ate chicken curry in Malikh Family, you don’t have to prepare food for us,” Grandpa Piss said.</p>\n<p>“How about breakfast? Are we still have leftover chickens, Yulong?”</p>\n<p>“We still have some leftover grilled village chicken, I’ll talk with the kitchen to reheat two portion first thing in the morning,” Yulong said.</p>\n<p>The Yashura Family’s patriarch was a role model of the stereotype Mossack people. He loved to cook and loved even more to feed people. It was no wonder why southern Mossacks’ visitors always felt welcomed whenever they visited the southern lands.</p>\n<p>“I sent them to bring <em>rendang</em> to Malikh Family, I never expected something like that to happen, hah!” Patriarch Shuro shook his head with a weak smile plastered on his face. During their talk, Grandpa Piss mentioned they met with Shira and Mila, as well mentioned the duel that happened between the two families’ young ladies and the upcoming duel between Shira and the young noble from Blackwood Family. “Whatever, if jerks wanted to fight with us, we won’t back down. Yashura Family never a coward!”</p>\n<p>“I believe Young Master Shira knows what he has to do,” Grandpa Piss assured.</p>\n<p>“I hope so, pity his father never around to hold the sky falling for him,” Patriarch Shuro gulped his <em>tuak</em>. “Anyway, let’s talk about something else. That Ghalim, you checked on him, Grandpa? What’s happened to him?”</p>\n<p>Snotty a little scared when Shuro Yashura suddenly brought up that topic. Snotty glanced at Butler Yulong’s wrinkled face, Yulong smiled back at him. The big muscle man couldn’t help but shuddered inside.</p>\n<p>“Patriarch Ghalim isn’t feeling well after eating some unhygienic food. I already prescribed some medicine for him, but I don’t know when he’d be able to get back at being patriarch since his digestive system was never good.”</p>\n<p>“Ah, is that so? Never knew he had something like that,” Patriarch Shuro mumbled. “There’s this really bad rumor about him being poisoned, Grandpa Piss, we never had something wicked like that in Badril Village.”</p>\n<p>“No, no no no, I can assure you, it’s not poison. I’ve been in the business more than seventy years--it’s <em>not</em> a poison.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss helped Yashura Family a lot when the patriarch’s in-law, Jhuro’s wife, had Shira in her belly. So Patriarch Shuro had long esteemed Grandpa Piss’s medicinal skill, even though he didn’t really had any idea how skillful the friendly old man was. He believed Grandpa Piss in the end.</p>\n<p>“We shouldn’t talk about sad things, Patriarch. Here, I bought a <em>tuak</em> my family handmade ourself. Let’s give it a try,” Grandpa Piss said.</p>\n<p>“Please, let me,” Butler Yulong asked the <em>tuak</em> bottle Grandpa Piss took out and poured it evenly to Patriarch Shuro’s, Grandpa Piss’s, along with Snotty’s glasses.</p>\n<p>The second thing Patriarch Shuro loved, after coconuts, was a strong <em>tuak</em>. He was the first one to gulp his glass clean, and he sighed about how good Grandpa Piss’s family <em>tuak</em> craft was. However, soon after that, his eyes somehow became heavy.</p>\n<p>“Huhh… usually, I still can drink till dawn…” Patriarch Shuro said with a yawn. “Let’s drink together… come on, Snotty, come drink with Uncle Shuro more.”</p>\n<p>“Patriarch, I think you are tired,” Yulong said softly, rejecting to pour patriarch’s glass.</p>\n<p>“Snotty, you go accompany Uncle Shuro inside,” Grandpa Piss said.</p>\n<p>Snotty nodded while still holding his glass full of <em>tuak</em>. The liquor was definitely mixed with something. Considering it was his grandfather who presented it, it was amazing to see Patriarch Shuro Yashura to be able to resist the urge to sleepiness. Snotty stood up and brought the yawning Shuro Yashura away.</p>\n<p>After both of them gone, Yulong picked up a clean glass. He poured the liquor that made Patriarch Shuro sleepy and drank it for himself. Grandpa Piss took out his second bottle and accompanied Yulong drinking <em>tuak</em>.</p>\n<p>“Is there’s something you need to discuss with me?” Yulong asked.</p>\n<p>“Indeed, it’s about Ghalim Malikh’s real condition…” Grandpa Piss didn’t leave any details when he told the Butler Yulong what had really happened in Malikh Family, particularly his discovery about the true nature of poison that made Patriarch Ghalim bedridden.</p>\n<p>When he heard that shocking fact, there was no surprise in the butler’s old face. Only sorrow and regret.</p>\n<p>“I knew this would happened,” Yulong sighed.</p>\n<p>“Then there’s Blackwood Family too…” Grandpa Piss’s sigh followed. “They seems interested in taking away Young Lady Bhela as a bride… I really don’t know what to say…”</p>\n<p>Yulong drank the <em>tuak</em> and told Grandpa Piss his reasoning, “That boy from Blackwood Family still hasn’t accepted Sir Jhuro’s decission to retire sixteen years ago. He’s been keeping quiet because he knew even the royalty and the organization behind him couldn’t protect him from Old Sir Lharu’s and Old Madam Sari’s retrubution. Time’s change. I reckon there’s some change somewhere that make him cocky.”</p>\n<p>“Old Sir and Old Madam too far away to give help in case something like this happens suddenly. Should I help you and Sir Jhuro keeping tabs on Blackwood Family?” Grandpa Piss asked.</p>\n<p>While Jhuro Yashura left behind resources and men outside before he retired, he almost never interacted with the high society of nobility. For ears and eyes to reach those fancy places, it would take time and efforts for current Yulong and Shuro Yashura to do so. It was way better to ask Grandpa Piss who already familiar due to his family’s generations of Alchemist profession. However, Yulong rejected the offer without giving it a real thought.</p>\n<p>“You don’t need to worry. Blackwood Family only taking a ride of that boy’s ambition. If he really supports his foster family right from the start, Blackwood won’t be stuck with their viscount nobility rank.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss wanted to offer any more help, but he long sensed the old butler’s distrust of him on affairs that didn’t include medicines and elixirs. So he kept his mouth shut for the time being.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, a golden owl landed on the veranda where the two old men enjoyed their <em>tuak</em>. The own brought a small piece of paper and inked quill with it.</p>\n<p>“Go, send this message to Sir Jhuro, as fast as possible!” Butler Yulong said to the owl after he wrote his tiny letter. Then he glanced at Grandpa Piss and said, “this is an owl I keep around in case there’s an emergency. Sir Jhuro also brought one with him.”</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss nodded with a painful smile. This golden owl was long thought to be extinct, but the reality there were small amounts of them were being kept in case of emergencies. They were rare, almost becoming birds of legend. Small to medium sized kingdoms wouldn’t dare to think getting their hands on it, not to mention Grandpa Piss’s own family. But this old butler had one with him. And the prodigial man of Yashura Family casually brought this treasure bird with him to travel around the southern land.</p>\n<p>“This is really for emergency,” Yulong said coldly, knowing full well the old Alchemist’s envy.</p>\n<p>“I know, I know--for emergency.”</p>\n<p>The owl then flew away bringing Yulong’s letter.</p>\n<p>Grandpa Piss and Snotty returned back to their own village the next morning. After sending them away, Yulong found out the young master, Shira Yashura, wanted to go to the market to pick some goods for his contracted pedlers to sell. He was worried the young master’s inexperience getting him exploited. Therefore, he waited in the gate and followed the boy from behind.</p>\n<p>In front of an inn owned by Elzhier Family, Yulong saw a familiar eastern Kaya man came out with a respectable, but humble Mossack man behind him. The Kaya man, Sir Kurusiya, noticed Yulong, immediately cupped his fist and bowed his body. That was a salute of great respect eastern Kaya men usually give to people they regard highly. Sir Baront Staterwind didn’t know what was going on, so he imitated his companion to salute Yulong even though he didn’t really know he was only a butler.</p>\n<p>“You know them, Yulong?” Shira asked.</p>\n<p>“The Kaya man once works in the same place as your father, young master.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, that’s why you know him.” Yulong was his mother helper, and his father brought him along to Yashura Family when Shira still in his mother’s belly. Shira never liked to listen about his father’s past, even though it was often glorified since he was completely stopped marauding bandits from approaching Badril Village. Walking toward the market, Shira kept quiet and didn’t ask the matter any further.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Far away from Badril Village, the golden owl Yulong tasked with the emergency letter flew through walls of mist and mountains. It instinctively knew the location of its recipient, Jhuro Yashura, even though Yulong wasn’t necesserarily knew where he was. Not even a half day passed by since the bird took off from Yashura Family, it flew already more than halfway toward its destination.</p>\n<p>Its speed was unprecendeted amongst the magical beast. No wonder commonfolks thought it was the bird of the legend. It was a shame that it failed to detect a single flash on the horizon, resulting it to succumb to a terrible fate.</p>\n<p><em>Flap flap flap!</em></p>\n<p>The owl futilely tried to avoid danger.</p>\n<p>A single flash all it took to capture the dumbfounded owl. A pair of cold talons gripped its short neck and the next thing it knew, the owl panically flapping its wings in search of oxygen, only to be deprived of fresh air even more. The owl couldn’t see the beast, it only saw a dashingly crimson flash before it was captured by the neck. The hostile beast scretched, only after that the owl realized a damned predator eagle already got it. Annoyed by the owl’s desperate struggle, the eagle broke its neck. The handsome crimson-colored eagle then delivered the dead owl to a mysterious masked man, who then passed it to another man--a pale, thin man who only dressed himself as black as the phantom itself.</p>\n<p>“This owl coming out from Yashura Family, Mister Blackwood. The bird brings a letter with it,” the masked man said as he presented the letter to the pale man.</p>\n<p>“Ah, so they figured it out about the poison,” the pale man with Blackwood surname said. Beside him and the masked man, there was a third man who drained the blood of the golden owl, prepared a little feast of its dead body. The man was very peculiar; bald, with veined oversized muscles that looked like it was almost exploded, and the strange tatooes that covered its body. He was a northern barbarian, the kind that never took orders from civilized men no matter they came from the west, south, or the east. Yet, when the Blackwood guy told him top plucking the dead owl, he obidiently put aside the carcass, not daring to show any hints of disatisfaction.</p>\n<p>“Mister, the young lady of Malikh Family turns out to be a four-elemental Unique Class, she’s a real talent with tremendous potential--your sister tries to take her to Blackwood Family and having a setback because there’s some experts happened to visit Malikh Family. Shall we send anymore resources to help her?”</p>\n<p>“What’s her Blackwood Family have to do with me? It’s already good enough I let her to use my name to coerce people and strengthen her influence in commerce world. She’s getting annoying every time she’s using my toys. That Jhuju’s poison I sent to her only a reminder to Ghalim of our old friendship, my sister should be thankful enough if she gets some benefits from it.”</p>\n<p>The masked man knew the pale man was irritated by his sister’s cockiness. So he excused himself and brought the crimson eagle with him, disappearing into the shadow.</p>\n<p>“We’ve rested enough,” the pale man said as he crumbled the small letter he read. The bald barbarian’s head cocked and he await the order. “Prepare the horses,” the man continued, “I’ve got an old friend I should say hi to.”</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-6/chapter-6":"<p>When the news about what happened in Malikh Family’s ngajen ceremony arrived at Blackwood Family, Madam Blackwood was so enraged she broke the tea cup she held onto the floor. Establishing the family’s foot in Badril Village was supposed to be easy, but not only he failed to gain the support of Malikh Family and the villagers, the Young Master of Blackwood Family somehow managed to incite the bedridden patriarch’s supporters to regain their lost foothold against the corrupt Malikh Family’s elders.</p>\n<p>“There’s no point keeping him in that rural village,” Madam Blackwood said. She was a flamboyant, late thirty years old woman whose beauty was so superior that the previous viscount adopt her as a daughter. “Call Frane back to the city, he’s going to spend two months training in capital!”</p>\n<p>The butler who was waiting for her bowed and went away to carry out the task.</p>\n<p>“How’s Lyla’s birthday party going?”</p>\n<p>“Reply to madam, the party has started, the guests who came only from baron nobilities and mid-rank merchants,” a maid replied.</p>\n<p>The madam glanced the timid middle-aged man who sat on the same table as her. She scoffed, saying, “Look how your daughter made a name for herself. Not only the bribe money was wasted away, she coming on trips in the seminars only resulting her made a fool out of herself! Hah, like father, like daughter! Imbecile!”</p>\n<p>Madam Blackwood hurled the new cup that recently poured with hot, scalding tea. She purposely aimed at the table so the hot water splashed on the viscount’s hands. The timid viscount didn’t make a sound when his hands getting burnt, he didn’t dare to fight against his wife. It was already ten years too late for him to retaliate in any way. From the way he dragged his limping leg to fetch damp towel for his scaling skin, it was clear the waiting servants already used to ignore him.</p>\n<p>Recently, his wife’s mood had became the worst ever since their youngest daughter came back from the two years seminars. Unlike Frane--who only registered as his son by blood in papers, Lyla hadn’t show any particular talents in becoming a Class worthy of a noble family. She had a decent progress speed, a Level 7 Novice after seminars, but that progress mainly because she never had the interest to train herself. Madam Blackwood had bribed the officials so Lyla could enter the seminars supposed to boost her standing in high society, so she could catch higher ranking nobles eyes somehow. However, that plan failed in the worst way that could happen to a noble family like the Blackwood. She made blunders and broke rules so many times that she became a laughing stock. The only families that interested in her only lower rank nobles and not-so well off merchant families.</p>\n<p>“There also no point keeping that useless girl forever in the mansion,” Madam Blackwood said. “Send her to Badril Village by tomorrow. Make some smart men tending to her needs--they have to smart enough to know how to reel those Malikh villagers to say yes when I send my words in the future!”</p>\n<p>After the son’s failure, the madam would send her daughter, to do nothing but play around in Malikh Family. Even if there was something the girl could do, the madam surely wouldn’t choose this daughter of hers who she deemed too brainless to do even the simplest tasks. Her daughter was just that useless to her. The one with received the orders were people who accompanied her, who had experience in bribing and coercing. They were tasked to devour Malikh Family from the inside. The Blackwood would surely corner Bhela Malikh this time.</p>\n<p>Somewhere else, in a colorless courtyard, a birthday party already went on for about two hours. Most guests already leaving, not unlike the year before the two-years seminars happened when the sons of noble families dallying around waiting for a chance to talk with the young lady. Today, the Young Lady of Blackwood Family turned fourteen, two years before she would considered mature, but this young miss still pouting her mouth like a little girl.</p>\n<p>The old handmaid saw her young lady was bored and offered a treat.</p>\n<p>“Young lady, try this cake. A certain famous bakery made this just for your birthday.”</p>\n<p>The cake served on a small plate along with a silver fork. The girl took only mere seconds to finish it.</p>\n<p>“Is it good?” the handmaid asked.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t matter if it’s good or not, Aunt Jiji, I still hungry with this tiny minny bit of cake! Let me eat that one!” the girl pointed at the layered cake served on the center of the party.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Lyla, you can’t!”</p>\n<p>“Why can’t I?!”</p>\n<p>“You must present yourself as a proper young lady, so you can’t!”</p>\n<p>The cake was to be portioned to serve for the same amount of guests since the last party, but because the Blackwood Family’s young lady had a bad reputation in the seminars, most invited families didn’t actually come.</p>\n<p>“But I can’t be a lady if I’m hungry, am I?”</p>\n<p>“You must learn the way. Be patient, Young Lady Lyla!”</p>\n<p>“But I am huuungriiiiieeeehhh!!!”</p>\n<p>Aunt Jiji was terrified when she realized the young lady wasn’t referred only to portion of the cake, but she wanted to eat the whole cake. This shorty girl, although her feature was thin with only her cheeks got plump, actually had a talent to be a terrifying glutton that would be seen in Tiramikal Continent every one hundred years. It was a useless talent that brought only shame to Blackwood Family.</p>\n<p>It was fortunate that before the young lady could make a big ruckus, a maidservant came to bring the news about the madam’s decision. Aunt Jiji passed it to the young lady immediately.</p>\n<p>“You heard that, young lady! Madam is going to send you for a vacation!”</p>\n<p>Lyla’s head straightened, she forgot to pout. “Vacation? Where? Where where?”</p>\n<p>“To Badril Village!”</p>\n<p>“Badril Village?” the girl tilted her head. “Where’s that?”</p>\n<p>“If you promise Aunt Jiji not to eat too much cake today, Aunt Jiji will tell you where it is…”</p>\n<p>“I will if it turned out somewhere fun!”</p>\n<p>“Badril Village is where Young Lady Bhela’s home place!”</p>\n<p>“Sis Bhela’s home?!” Lyla gasped, “yahoooo!!!”</p>\n<p>Ignoring that she was the center of attention, Lyla suddenly jumped and danced like no tomorrow. Aunt Jiji tried to stop her, but it was futile since Lyla only promised not to be glutton. The remaining guests began whispering with each other. They were people who doubted the rumors about this Young Lady Blackwood, but after seeing how childish and ridiculous the girl danced, people were finally convinced. How was this a viscount’s daughter supposed to act? The girl danced her hips and hopped around like a bunny that had an itchy bum. Soon, the Young Lady Lyla Blackwood fell to the bottom list of desired young ladies to marry. Her reputation fell from not-so-smart, to stupid, and then fell again to brainless and imbecile. People didn’t see her in a good light. But that just how a girl named Lyla Blackwood really was.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Yashura Family got a peculiar visitor these past two days. He introduced himself as an expert from overseas, and somehow this foreign expert became interested in Shira Yashura. When the story leaked by insiders from Yashura Family, people were scratching their heads, wondering what could an educated man saw from this trash who could only get himself to level 3 Novice. Some people even sneered, saying that whole news was just Yashura Family’s little trick to clear up rumors from their heir’s name.</p>\n<p>“You understand, kiddo? There are three mandatory rules if someone wants to meet privately with me. First rule, it’s a <em>she</em>, not <em>he</em>. Second rule, big boobs. Third rule, in her lower part, there must be big bubbly butts, as big as her boobs. <em>Anything</em> lesser than that you can just send them back to wherever they came from.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit said that as he moved his chess piece, eating one of Shira’s pawns.</p>\n<p>“And remember, my standard is pretty high. Consult with how loadful those girls from Big-Boobed Sect are for more information,” the Nalaq continued.</p>\n<p>“Please don’t talk nonsense. I’m being serious here,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“Ey, I’m not talking nonsense. The girls from Big-Boobed Sect are real deal, okay? They’re huge! If you don’t believe me then you should go to Elzhier Family one of these days, go check out how glorious their boobs are. They always dance or become the maidservants when they’re not on duties.”</p>\n<p>“Ol’ Good-Natured Spirit… I don’t want to hear this imaginary all-woman sect of yours. Elzhier Family is only a normal rural family, they don’t host any sect members within their walls. If they did, the Village Head would boast about it at my uncle’s face every single day.”</p>\n<p>“You just don’t believe it because you never see how great they are--their boobs, I mean. How great those melons inside tight suits are! Just think about it; leather suits and melons--two entirely different things but if they come together they’d jiggling in harmony. This Good-Natured Spirit approved their sense of style.”</p>\n<p>“Forget about it, it’s not important--”</p>\n<p>“Boobs are important, ey!”</p>\n<p>Shira waved his hand as he didn’t want to continue this nonsense. He then moved a piece and finished his turn. He returned the topic back again, “The expert said he came from a first-tier faction called Blue Robe Society. If we can get his faction’s recognition then at least my family can silence all those rumors about me--especially the recent ones, they really are becoming a pain in the ass.”</p>\n<p>“I told you. I don’t talk with guys. No boobs, no good. Period.”</p>\n<p>“You are really becoming a pain in the ass,” Shira complained.</p>\n<p>After Shira said that, Good-Natured Spirit’s knight jumped over a wall of pawns to get on his bishop. Within a single breath Shira immediately moved his rook, creating a chain reaction that exposes the Nalaq’s defence, resulting his king trapped in three different direction.</p>\n<p>“Check mate.”</p>\n<p>“Ey, what the fu--” Good-Natured Spirit rage quit, flipping the chess board. “Hah! I knew it! You brat, you intentionally make me talk about boobs in order to lower my guard, right?! Fuck! That is how it is, isn’t it?!”</p>\n<p>“No, it is not.”</p>\n<p>“You sneaky bastard. You really got me,” Good-Natured Spirit threw his hands up in the air. <br>\n“Man, I surrender, that is some sick psychological tactic you got there.”</p>\n<p>“Now I don’t really know what you’re talking about.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit waved his hands in surrender, then he lit a cigarette. “Anyway, what do you want from me this time? Money again? I prepared some kobe coins enough for you to buy some candy, here, take this.”</p>\n<p>Shira shoved back the coin bag. “Not today. I just want you to meet Sir Baront Staterwind.”</p>\n<p>“No boobs, no good. Ask something else. How about I tell you the secret place where are those Big-Boobed Sect girls take their bath, ‘ey? Seems fair deal to me.”</p>\n<p>“How many times do I have to tell you--”</p>\n<p>“Sssshhh!!” Good-Natured Spirit hushed the boy. He then whispered, “you hear that?”</p>\n<p>Because the Nalaq suddenly became vigilant, Shira instinctively lowered his voice too. “Hear what?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“I heard some rats watching us…” the Nalaq covered his mouth, as if he didn’t want people to read lips what he said next, “some big-boobed rats…”</p>\n<p>“Huh… what?”</p>\n<p>“The girls from Big-Boobed Sect… they’re here…”</p>\n<p>“The heck are you talking about? This hill is Yashura Family’s property--”</p>\n<p>“Sssshhhh! They’ve noticed me noticing them. Wait here, I’mma get you some melons for your reward!”</p>\n<p>After he saying that, Good-Natured Spirit’s figure melting into the thin air.</p>\n<p>Shira Yashura sighed. At times, asking favor to this vulgar Nalaq not only difficult, it also unpredictable he’d only incite troubles if he not careful.</p>\n<p>After his winning streak for more than half a year maybe he became cocky. He forgot the Nalaq wasn’t there to solve his problem whenever he wanted, although the Nalaq sort of ended up like that after a few months he came here. Shira got some thinking, maybe he should stop seeing this Nalaq as his convenient piggy bank for his own good.</p>\n<p>“Really, he always making a mess for me to clean. I wonder if such thoughtless Nalaqs like him are common around here… now, where’s the last piece again?” he sighed for the second time.</p>\n<p>When he was picking up chess pieces that board Good-Natured Spirit flipped earlier, Shira realized there was a missing piece. Turned out it was stuck in the hole between tree roots.</p>\n<p>He plunged his hand to look for the missing chess piece.</p>\n<p>“Ugh… my fingers can’t reach.”</p>\n<p>He tried to squirm his body to fit his hand in.</p>\n<p>“Where is it again?”</p>\n<p>He frowned. He squirmed his body again really hard.</p>\n<p>“Oh, there it--”</p>\n<p><em>BOOOOOMMMMM!!!!</em></p>\n<p>An explosion happened not far away from the place he used to hang out, creating a wave of rolling dust that swept over the hill. Shira got his hand stuck between the tree rots, he could only hugged his head with his free hand and waited for the shockwave to finish. The chess pieces he gathered already nowhere to be found. He cooked up his head, looking left and right, and saw the greeny grasses were covered with dirts and trees were uprooted. The whole hill became a shithole kind of mess.</p>\n<p>Before the boy could swallow what was going on, a chuckle could be heard near him. Before him, Good-Natured Spirit emerged, coiling around the Nalaq’s body were purple-colored living flames that hungrily tried to eat him whole.</p>\n<p>As carefree as he usually was, Good-Natured Spirit said with a grin, “Those Big-Boobed Sect girls sure are feisty. They’re escaping too fast, I can’t get you melons. I managed to get a feeling of their butts, though. Here, there’s some fragrant left behind.”</p>\n<p>Shira stepped back when the Nalaq offered his palm. It was still on fire, the boy didn’t want to get burn along with him. Besides, he didn’t want to get involved with the Nalaq’s deprived hobby.</p>\n<p>“Sure you don’t want it?” Good-Natured Spirit took a last sniff from his palm, followed by a low chuckle of his.</p>\n<p>“Good-Natured Spirit… what’s that fire?”</p>\n<p>“Yeah? Dunno, man. Exorcism flame or something.”</p>\n<p>“Ohh… oh, it’s very nice to know you up until know. Good bye.”</p>\n<p>“Hmm? You want to go somewhere?” Realizing the purple flame was getting annoying, Good-Natured Spirit then patted away the coiling flame from his shoulders like it was nothing.</p>\n<p>Shira shrugged his shoulders. It seemed this bastard Nalaq was too tough for that exorcism flame. Maybe the flame was too ordinary? Whatever, he didn’t care about that anymore. His eyes then swept the ruin around him. He said, “You can’t forget about the meeting for today. But please clean the mess you made yourself.”</p>\n<p>“That’s what you want for the chess reward?”</p>\n<p>Shira nodded.</p>\n<p>“Aye, aye, will do.” Good-Natured Spirit flicked his fingers, and human-sized paper cranes came out of thin air. They were obedient, not clear whether were monsters or just magical devices. The paper cranes used magnet-like magic to carry the messy uprooted trees and boulders, along with sweeping the dirt from the grass. The cleaning up might take a while, since the hill really was a mess. Shira, feeling a little light on the head, facepalming as he returned back to Yashura Family.</p>\n<p>The whole explosion could be heard from all over Badril Village. It wasn’t clear what its cause, but Yashura Family sent guards to prevent people from knowing what really happened. In Yashura Family’s guest hall, Patriarch Shuro Yashura, a few good Yashura Family elders, and the respected visitor, Sir Baront Staterwind, forming a circle as they sat cross-legged, discussing the explosion that had just occurred.</p>\n<p>“Good elders, Sir Patriarch Yashura, I know you must get excited when I said Young Master Shira has some talent in communicating with Nalaqs. However, a Nalaq still a Nalaq. You must not offend a Nalaq whatsoever, or the consequence is dire! Young Master Shira’s life is way more important than getting a qualification to enter my school!” Sir Baront Staterwind warned. His forehead was still wet with sweat, since he hurriedly ran to Yashura Family when he realized the direction of recent explosion.</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, you’re right, Sir Staterwind. Absolutely right! I already sent someone to check on my nephew’s condition, please calm down,” Patriarch Shuro said.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront shook his head. “You don’t really know what I’m trying to say, do you? You should prepare a very good healer or a doctor, Patriarch Shuro, because if it isn’t death, one can easily lose a limb over angering a Nalaq! That happens more often than you think!”</p>\n<p>The elders drew cold breaths in unison when they heard that. Patriarch Shuro, whose face already pale, becoming even whiter than a sheet of paper. If they boy lost a limb, Shira’s chance to succeed him as the next patriarch could be swept away like specks of dust.</p>\n<p>Yulong the Butler arrived. Everyone in the room had been anxiously waiting for him they instinctively stood up when Yulong approached.</p>\n<p>“Yulong, how’s Shira doing?” Patriarch Shuro asked.</p>\n<p>Yulong replied, “Young Master Shira is back, patriarch. But Madam Yashura sent him to the kitchen for a second breakfast.”</p>\n<p>“Breakfast? What’s a breakfast has something to do with that explosion? Can he still walk?”</p>\n<p>“He’s walking fine, Patriarch Yashura.”</p>\n<p>“Then, Yulong, please go fetch my nephew for me, we have something urgent to tell him!”</p>\n<p>After his trained elegant bow, Yulong stepped back and proceeded to do the task given to him.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront Staterwind peered at the butler’s back. He traveled southern lands many times, visiting many villages, yet, he seldom heard a Mossack descent major family employed western-style butler. What made him confused even more that Sir Kurusiya apparently knew the butler and gave his respect to him, which Sir Baront Staterwind didn’t expect that coming from the cold eastern Kaya swordsman.</p>\n<p>“Dear good elder,” Sir Baront Staterwind asked a random elder who sat beside him, “may I know why there’s a butler working here?”</p>\n<p>“Is Sir referring to Yulong? Yulong isn’t actually working for Yashura Family, but Young Master Shira’s mother’s attendant. I can’t tell you the details, so forgive me sir, all I can say is Young Master Shira’s father is exceedingly brave and awesome he managed to woo a respectable lady many years ago.”</p>\n<p>“Ahhh…” Sir Baront nodded. The boy apparently a result of his parent eloping. The Blue Robe Society expert of course knew etiquette to hold himself from digging the story further.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, Yulong came back with Shira followed behind. The boy wore new clothes since his previous one was dirty. When he saw the group of elders and the expert guest looking at him, Shira sighed inside his heart. He knew he had to clean Good-Natured Spirit’s mess once again.</p>\n<p>“Greetings, elders… greetings, uncle patriarch… greetings, Sir Staterwind…”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro impatiently treading forward. “Shira my boy, is it true that you lost your limbs?”</p>\n<p>“I’m unhurt, uncle, see?” Shira waved both of his hands to prove that his limbs still functioned as they should be.</p>\n<p>“Oh! God, thank God! Really! These are really your hands, aren’t they? Not a fake one made with wood?” Patriarch Shuro Yashura grabbed his nephew hands and waved it around like a child playing with flags.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira,” Sir Baront opened his mouth, “I reckon you failed to ask the Nalaq to meet me? If you can’t do it, young master, it best for you not to push him any further. Today, you offend him and he blast the hill behind your Yashura Family as a warning, but what happens if you make the same mistake tomorrow?”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro nodded at his words vigorously. “Sir Baront is right, Shira my boy. A Nalaq is a revered being ancient Mossacks worshiped as their guardian angel. The consequence of making them mad is very dire! You should know better, my boy, you should’ve told your uncle if a Nalaq came to you the first time!”</p>\n<p>Sir Baront and his uncle Patriarch Shuro had good intentions in telling him about how to be respectful to a Nalaq. But the more Shira heard their warning, the more he doubted about Good-Natured Spirit being a “revered” Nalaq like they said. Of course, saying the truth about the explosion’s true cause resulting only Yashura Family losing face in front of Sir Baront Staterwind. Shira had no choice, he had to tread the matter very carefully.</p>\n<p>“<em>Cough, cough</em>… Uncle, Sir Baront, thank you for your concern. Truth is, it wasn’t that the Nalaq being mad that causes the explosion, but there was some… accident… that happened right before.”</p>\n<p>“With what title do you usually call him, Young Master Shira?” Sir Baront asked.</p>\n<p>“As far as I know, he doesn’t have a title. At least he didn’t tell me if he ever had one. He told me to call him ‘Good-Natured Spirit’.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, with that kind of nickname, he must be a very benevolent person when he was alive,” Sir Baront concluded as he rubbed his beard. “So, Young Master Shira, it seems he didn’t really intent to blast into smithereens.”</p>\n<p>Shira nodded. That part was true. Instead, someone else happened to be intending to blast this Nalaq into smithereens.</p>\n<p>“Thank God! Thank God! If he is a good Nalaq, maybe we don’t need to throw the second ngajen ceremony for this month, after all!” Patriarch Shuro Yashura exclaimed. The elders in the guest hall followed his exclaiming by handclapping and joyful cries. Ngajen ceremony only held once a month so the village safe from angry Selaqs, no one ever tried it to protect themselves from intelligent Nalaqs. Since the village was founded, the locals never had a Nalaq dwelling there. So it was natural for the elders to worry about throwing a ceremony they didn’t know working or not. Ngajen ceremony was expensive, after all.</p>\n<p>The more Shira saw how the previous tense hall turned jubilant and full of relieved faces, the more awkward he became. That Nalaq might call himself ‘Good-Natured Spirit’, yet he was anything but good. A low-life spirit who no doubt had been using the invisibility traits of spirits to commit many deprived crimes. He was closer to evil spirit incarnation than a good-natured one. The misunderstanding was too great his face twisted as if he’d just taste a sour lemon.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront Staterwind said, “Still, since he seems reluctant to use his old name, I reckon the Nalaq that approaching you is a low-tier one, Young Master Shira. Low-tier Nalaqs usually spirits that gain consciousness merely by luck. They don’t have factions backing them, and fortunately--in my experience--it easier to initiate negotiation with unaffiliated Nalaqs.” A hint of pride then flashed through his eyes, he continued, “my disciples will arrive tomorrow morning. One of them contracted with a high-tier Nalaq. Since the Nalaq’s mood turned sour is partly my fault, with help from the Nalaq contracted with one of my disciples, I will ask him to leave Yashura Family peacefully!”</p>\n<p>“Sir Staterwind is wise! Thank you for your concern, Sir!” Patriarch Shuro sang praises toward this expert. The elders of Yashura Family followed suit.</p>\n<p>“As expected of such expert!”</p>\n<p>“Sir Staterwind is the best of bunch of all experts that I know all my life!”</p>\n<p>“Hurray for Sir Staterwind!”</p>\n<p>They circling Sir Baront Staterwind and, not long after that, someone started to prostate. They behaved as if the guest was their one and only savior. Even Shira was getting embarrassed from seeing the scene, not to mention the already flushing Baront Staterwind.</p>\n<p>When everyone getting carried away, Shira slipped out after excusing himself. He knew he was no match for the Yashura Family’s older generations’ shamelessness. Upon walking outside, he saw Yulong was standing by the hall’s door looking galant as usual with his butler professionalism.</p>\n<p>“Can you please try to stop my uncle, Yulong? Sir Staterwind is started to get uncomfortable there.”</p>\n<p>Yulong glanced at the whole mess inside, and then he said to his young master, “I think it’s not everyday an expert coming to Yashura Family, young master, so let’s count this as Patriarch Yashura to gaining favors from a foreign expert.”</p>\n<p>“Are they really okay, though?”</p>\n<p>Yulong smiled.</p>\n<p>“Of course they aren’t, young master. But Patriarch Shuro and the family elders are honest people. Although sometimes they can be overwhelming, I’m sure Sir Staterwind can see no falsehood in their words.”</p>\n<p>Shira looked at those elders inside once again. The more he saw, the more he realized that those hysterical village men calling a man they barely knew these past two days a savior by no means a lie from their part. The elders really were freaking out when they heard the explosion. And Patriarch Shuro Yashura was the most worried of the bunch, considering him a patriarch and an uncle. Thinking about it all again, Shira couldn’t really say he still embarrassed seeing the elders spewing exaggerated flattering with straight faces.</p>\n<p>“Sir Staterwind comes from a respectable sect. Someone like that won’t get to travel the southern lands if he didn’t know the nature of the local people. So it best not to worry about it too much, young master,” Yulong said.</p>\n<p>“Really… ah, speaking of sects,” Shira deliberately changed the topic, “I heard from someone that one of the major families in Badril Village hosts members of a certain sect in secret. You’re from outside, Yulong--do you think something so outrageous like that could happen?”</p>\n<p>“Some older sects have long reaching influence, but I don’t think anyone would be interested to plant their own in Badril Village. There’s nothing valuable here for them to take notice.”</p>\n<p>“As I thought. It’s just unthinkable to think some secret powers lurking beneath our everyday lives. What if some experts actually pretending to be servants here in Yashura Family?”</p>\n<p>Although it wasn’t noticeable, Yulong’s smile became stiff.</p>\n<p>“You jest, young master. If that was true, do you think your uncle and the elders can take that kind of truth?”</p>\n<p>Following Yulong’s gaze, Shira peeped the hall and saw Sir Baront’s awkward figure, where he was in the center of Yashura Family elites--all of them-- who passionately prostrating in the floor. They practically worshipping him now.</p>\n<p>“You’re right…” Shira could only hide his face with his palm. Just when he thought he could understand them, the boy then wished he didn’t know these shameless men.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>As far as the current generation of Badril Village locals knew, they never got visited by nobles until this month Malikh Family’s ngajen ceremony happened. Everyone still talking about it.</p>\n<p>Young Master of Blackwood Family only stayed in Badril Village in one day. And the noble carriage of Blackwood Family set off out of Badril Village by noon. The next morning after the day he was gone, the two foreign guests who had been staying in Malikh Family, Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia, felt overstaying might be unnecessary, thus decided to leave too.</p>\n<p>Because the carriages going out from Badril Village mostly for public transports, Bhela personally asked an elder from his father’s faction who had a horse carriage to give her guests a ride to the nearest town, where they’d later book a private carriage for them to return home. Mister Harrington, as an unsocial bachelor as he always was, was waiting in the carriage for Madame Sylvia to say her parting words to Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>“You have a very bright future, Young Lady Bhela. A girl with limitless potential. So your favor will become very valuable as you mature,” Madame Sylvia said. “If you need something, you can always send letters to my sect. Don’t hold back. Just think about this of us making an investment.”</p>\n<p>Since Bhela a smart girl anyway, Madame Sylvia decided not to make her words fancy and told her in a straightforward manner. Bhela appreciated her honesty, and said her thanks.</p>\n<p>The carriage then set off. In the main gate of Badril Village, the guards on duty witnessed the recently blazing popular Young Lady Bhela Malikh bowing her body as she sent off two foreigners in traveling clothes made from expensive linen.</p>\n<p>“Look at how she is,” inside the carriage, Madame Sylvia said to Mister Harrington. “She’s a pretty sensible girl, don’t you think?”</p>\n<p>“She is,” Mister Harrington said softly, almost a murmur.</p>\n<p>It was hard to start a conversation whenever Mister Harrington sat with his arms crossed tightly. Madame Sylvia could see that he wasn’t exactly happy with the outcome regarding Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>There was no bandits lurking around, and no monsters occasionally came out, proved that the lands around Badril Village actually well-protected--too well, perhaps, for a rural village without a major power backing them. Their journey was smooth without disturbance. Thirty minutes after they left Badril Village, they encountered another carriage painted with black-jet color. The black carriage was well-decorated with golden-colored plates, obviously elites or nobles were traveling inside.</p>\n<p>However, unlike common nobles who liked to hide in the carriage to show-off their elegance and aloofness, this carriage simply out of commonsense. To talk about how weird this carriage was there was a need to point out the refreshing greenness of the view around. Despite there being a road far away from settlement, hint of liveliness from bird chirping--along with croaking frogs from nearby streams and singing insects--completed the idyllic road with a strange harmony that invited light-hearted person to sing along with lively nature. That was exactly what the noble in the black carriage doing. A young lady with a very girly and childish feature was carefreely sitting in the window in spite of pale servants begging her to sit still. She completely dumb about the servants’ pleas. And with her personality, nobody knew whether she was pretending or not. The only thing that the jubilant Lyla Blackwood cared about was singing an off-tune song about her befriending village frogs and bunnies.</p>\n<p>“Prepare your life you frogs and bunnies~</p>\n<p>Cause I’m not letting you go before we become the best of buddies~~</p>\n<p>Wait for me you birdies and kitties~~</p>\n<p>Cause we’re about to become the best of all buddies~~ yuhuu~ yuhuu~~</p>\n<p>The best buddies in this lifetime~~ yuhuuuu~~~”</p>\n<p>There was nothing the servants and the guards could do to stop their young lady from singing this amazingly ugly song about her future exploits in Badril Village. Seeing that another carriage approaching, the horse-riding guards did their best to block the view to the crest planted on the carriage’s compartment. Their effort to save faces from the young lady’s mishap was futile, however, since the other party happened to know Lyla.</p>\n<p>“How many times have I told you to stay away from windows, Lyla!”</p>\n<p>“Whu--what? Who?” Lyla was surprised. But then she was elated to see a familiar face. “Is that you, Instructor Sylvia? You here to train Sis Bhela’s archery again?”</p>\n<p>“Get down from the window!” Madame Sylvia raised her voice.</p>\n<p>“I’m also here to meet Sis Bhela!” Lyla also raised her voice cheerfully.</p>\n<p>“Lyla, you won’t be able to get married in the future if you’re always act like this!” Madame Sylvia warned her. She long dropped title of Young Lady Blackwood when talking to this naughty girl.</p>\n<p>“Um!” Lyla nodded. “But which one do you like more, Instructor Sylvia, bunnies or kitties?” It was no use trying to talk sense to Lyla. Any warning only come to her right ear and gone out straight from the left one.</p>\n<p>“Stay away from the windows!!!” Madame Sylvia screamed until her voice shrilled.</p>\n<p>Lyla also screamed, “Good morning to you too!!!”</p>\n<p>Both carriages drifted apart after the brief encounter. It ended with Lyla happily waved her hands happily. Madame Sylvia sighed and shook her head. That girl was so naughty that the troubles she created made the seminars’ managements even considered to drop her once during the seminars. Only after Bhela Malikh convinced them she’d take care of Lyla they finally did let go the matter.</p>\n<p>Before, the black carriage of Blackwood Family came to Badril Village in the shroud of night’s darkness, so nobody noticed their elegance and the aura of expensive carriage blazing through the village road--of which was surprisingly wide for a settlement road, unlike road of cities in the western kingdoms, because long ago Mossack people needed to endure monster stampedes passing through their villages once every few months.</p>\n<p>“Mom, look, is that a noble?” a snotty kid pointing out the carriage.</p>\n<p>The mother hurriedly pulled her child. “Ssuuussh! Keep your finger to yourself! Don’t you know what happened to peasants that make noble angry from the stories they always talking about?”</p>\n<p>The steel-armored guards who escort the carriage scoffed them in disdain. Contrast with the escorts’ attitudes, Lyla waved her hand at them, while shouting, “Hey boy, don’t you think bunnies are cute as the kitties? Or do you like cats more?”</p>\n<p>The kid didn’t answer. He instead forced to bow by her mother and let the carriage went through silently. The villagers didn’t have the experience in receiving nobles, most of them--except for those who attended the ngajen ceremony in Malikh Family--had never saw nobles in their lives. Because of that they were awkward and didn’t know what to do.</p>\n<p>Lyla didn’t seem to mind their stiffness. Instead, she vigorously greeted everyone she saw from the window she sat on.</p>\n<p>“Good day! Good morning! I’m here to sleepover at Sis Bhela’s place! Do you know where Sis Bhela lives?”</p>\n<p>Back in Elzhier Family, in the main family’s house, their patriarch, hurriedly changed his clothes to a formal one he always used every ngajen ceremony.</p>\n<p>“Hurry, hurry! As the head of this village, how can I let a noble arriving without me receiving them?!”</p>\n<p>Not even he yet buttoned his shirt properly, the Village Head sprinted toward the main street, only to see the crowd of onlookers already dispersed and still talking about the scary nobles they always heard in stories were actually <em>weirdly</em> friendly.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Bhela Malikh was already notified about Lyla Blackwood’s arrival. She waited on a chair at the Malikh Family’s gate, drinking a fresh young coconut water occasionally. The black carriage finally was in her view. And the young girl she was waiting for happily waved her hand at her. From the window.</p>\n<p>“Carefull, Lyla!” Bhela yelled as she sprang from her chair.</p>\n<p>“Huuupp!” Lyla Blackwood simply didn’t want to waste anytime leaving the carriage through the door. So she simply jumped from the window she sat upon, before the carriage even stopped. It was fortunate that amongst Bhela’s skill as a Unique Class, she had <b>Haste</b>, which boosted her speed in short duration. She used that to catch Lyla before she hurt herself. The young noble girl landed splendidly in Bhela’s arm.</p>\n<p>“What’s this, Sistah?” Lyla’s eyes sparkled when she saw Bhela get a young coconut in her other hand. She was completely oblivious she just did something dangerous.</p>\n<p>“Young coconut. There’s still some of its water left. Here, try this,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“For me? Really?”</p>\n<p>“Drink slowly…”</p>\n<p><em>Glug glug glug</em>. Lyla drank the coconut in anything but in slowly manner. She even burped shamelessly.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Lyla, ah!” the butler who coming with her was in horror seeing how Young Lady Lyla Blackwood made a horrible mess by spilling the coconut water on her expensive, silk woven black dress. Only an equally expensive silk handkerchief worthy enough to wipe his young lady’s noble dress!</p>\n<p>“I told you to drink slowly…” Bhela said. She used her sleeve to wipe Lyla’s wet face, and then proceeded to also wipe Lyla’s dress.</p>\n<p>“Y-young miss!” the butler shouted in panic. His body jolted as soon as he saw the outrageous act of spoiling the young noble’s dress by making it contacted with commoner clothes. That was heresy! He needed her to stop before she contained Blackwood’s expensive dress with her commoner’s bacteria!</p>\n<p>“You need something?” Bhela looked at this unfamiliar butler of Blackwood Family. Her expressionless face judged the butler coldly.</p>\n<p>“My name is Tim, young miss--please use this!” the butler offered a silky smooth handkerchief with Blackwood Family’s crest embroidered on the surface. The handkerchief was actually the butler’s, was awarded to his great-great-great grandfather by the then Baron Blackwood for some sort of achievement that practically nobody was still alive to remember. Everytime Butler Tim met a new person, he’d make an excuse to show off this particular handkerchief. Today was no exception. It was his most precious handkerchief. Just from the look of it one could tell how crazy expensive it was.</p>\n<p>“Ah, ah… my nose… aahhh--” Lyla felt her nose was wet and itchy, “--ahhtchii!!!”</p>\n<p>“You’ve got a flu?” Bhela asked worriedly.</p>\n<p>“Yeah. Aunt Jiji told me to drink my medicine everyday but it’s so bitter. So much bitter that it’s evil!”</p>\n<p>“Where’s your medicine now?”</p>\n<p>“Oh. I throw it away last night.”</p>\n<p>Bhela shook her head.</p>\n<p>“That’s no good. You can’t throw away your medicine like that. Now, wipe your nose. This mister butler said to use this…” she put the handkerchief on Lyla’s nose, and Lyla blew her nose on it.</p>\n<p>Lyla gave back the handkerchief to Butler Tim. “Thank you, Sir Butler. It’s very helpful of you.”</p>\n<p>The butler received back his most precious handkerchief. Bonus Lyla’s snot.</p>\n<p>“Come on inside,” Bhela said to Lyla. “Even if the water runs dry, coconuts still have meat we can scoop. After that we’ll pick some star fruits that I planted since I was a child.”</p>\n<p>“Star fruits! Woohooo!”</p>\n<p>The girls then walked inside. Lyla was so excited she didn’t leave her friend, hanging on her neck like a koala being comfortable on a tree branch. The stories about a noble young lady coming to Malikh Family for Bhela Malikh spread amongst the maidservants like oil being poured on an open wildfire. The Malikhs couldn’t describe the pride seeing their eldest young lady with a blue blood friend. Especially the aunties. They watched how close Bhela and Lyla with teary eyes and happy smiles.</p>\n<p>“Young lady is… finally… finally…”</p>\n<p>“She finally has a friend…”</p>\n<p>“Huuu… huuu… merciful Goddesses finally saw the young lady’s plight and blessed her with a real friend… huuu huuuu….”</p>\n<p>Nobody more happier than the aunties who were familiar with how their Young Lady Bhela lived her live. They silently cried watching their young lady, who usually alone and unapproachable, finally grown up and had her first friend in these past ten years.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Butler Tim grimaced inside. Despite the fact that he was tasked to win over Bhela Malikh with any means necessary, he didn’t like this girl. It wasn’t because his handkerchief got dirty--well, maybe he resented her for it a little--it because the girl named Bhela Malikh wasn’t acting as a young country girl supposed to act. Country bumpkins supposed to falter when they saw the radiance seeped out of the nobles’ aura, they supposed to tremble when they saw the noble wealth glittering beneath the sun. But this girl was indifferent and aloof. She was cold but the coldness paired with concise and elegant mannerism. Butler Tim knew she trying to act noble herself. That was why he didn’t like her.</p>\n<p>However, Butler Tim was a smart person. Any smart person would wear a perfect smile despite his heart bleeding over the snot on his precious handkerchief. Before leaving the city, the butler didn’t forget to look for a gift he’d use to lower the Malikh Family’s guard. He heard the previous gift was rejected, and when he asked for the content of the gift, the smart Butler Tim shook his head as if he knew it would happen.</p>\n<p>Toward country bumpkins, too expensive gifts would never work. He knew this because he was smart. And because he was smart, he knew better gifts. Not-so-expensive gifts worked for country bumpkins.</p>\n<p>Therefore, he presented Bhela Malikh with popular city biscuits.</p>\n<p>“I heard this biscuit is currently very popular among noble young ladies. This butler happened to pass by a store that sold this, so I reckon Young Lady Bhela might love to taste some.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, because the elders roughly knew the Blackwood Family’s youngest lady would come to visit, two leaders of opposing factions came to watch how their Young Lady Bhela would receive the noble guest. Elder Jhamil was all smiling because he liked what he saw. But the expression of Elder Khasim turned sour when he saw how the butler of Blackwood Family tried to butter up to Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>“Don’t accept it, young lady, please….” Elder Khasim whispered under his breath. Of course, there was no single soul heard what he just said. He was worried the hard work to rebuild his faction’s morale all would turn into dust if people thought their spiritual mascot, the one and only Young Lady Bhela Malikh, could be bought with mere biscuits.</p>\n<p>Contrary to what Elder Khasim hoped, Bhela Malikh received the gift without even putting a second thought. A feeling of defeat surged inside him. Elder Jhamil looked at his rival with a mocking glance.</p>\n<p>After receiving the snacks, Bhela excused herself and brought Lyla with her to stroll around Malikh Family’s gardens. Butler Tim pretended to wave his hand and smiled, but inside, he was gloating at how hypocrite Bhela was. His guess that Young Lady Bhela wouldn’t refuse the gift he brought was entirely correct. Before, he deliberately said the biscuit was noble young ladies’ favorite. Thus, according to his smart logic, as long as it wasn’t too expensive that it’d scare this fake young lady, no way a noble wannabe would reject this kind of gifts.</p>\n<p>“Heh,” Butler Tim scoffed when Bhela and Lyla already left. “Bet you’ve never eaten any city biscuits your entire life, haven’t you.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, Bhela Malikh hadn’t had any city biscuits her entire life. Not before and also not today. What Butler Tim didn’t know was that the snacks he bought with his own money ultimately ended up returned to Blackwood Family--to be exact, it ended up inside Lyla Blackwood’s belly. Bhela couldn’t help but received the biscuits when, beside her, she saw Lyla was drooling looking at the biscuits.</p>\n<p>The elders led by Elder Jhamil then respectfully welcomed the butler along with servants and guards from Blackwood Family. From the impression alone, Butler Tim could see reasons for him to like this slick-tongued Elder Jhamil. He knew how to flatter and also he knew how to act humble in front of people with higher status than him. Not like that noble-wannabe Young Lady of Malikh Family. This Elder Jhamil knew that he was only a country bumpkin thus acted accordingly. Naturally, the smart Butler Tim was pleased.</p>\n<p>And so began Butler Tim’s quests to swallow Malikh Family with his smartly planned schemes and cunning political games.</p>\n<p>In mere hours, the neutral elders who hadn’t joined either both rivalling factions began flocking to Elder Jhamil’s side. One part because they wanted to side with the faction that had the noble support and another part simply because Elder Jhamil, with the help of Butler Tim, had been throwing around sweet deals over all directions.</p>\n<p>“Only one tenth of the elder council members don’t want to pick a side by now, but their number is too significant to be an obstacle for Sir Butler’s great plan,” Elder Jhamil reported the current situation to Butler Tim.</p>\n<p>The butler was enjoying a glass of tea served by the maid that supposed to serve Young Lady Lyla Blackwood as if he was the visiting noble himself. He nodded. “I see. With this, the first stage of my plan has been completed.”</p>\n<p>“Oohhh!” Elder Jhamil exclaimed. “Sir Butler summoned rain and fire by flipping Malikh Family’s political scene upside down, and this is only the first stage?! As expected, the Butler of Blackwood Family is very smart!”</p>\n<p>Butler Tim originally wanted to act aloof and sophisticated before he visited this rural village. However, upon being called a smart person, he couldn’t help but grinned widely. “Oho, you’re an interesting fella, aren’t you? Very well, since you’ve done a good job yourself, I won’t be so petty to grab all the credit. Tell me how I should do next, if I like what I hear, we might as well corporate your thoughts into my plan.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was excited. How could he not? An opportunity to rise beyond a mere elder of rural village was laid before him.</p>\n<p>“Sir Butler, you may not know this, but we Mossack people regard having a good meal very highly. Everytime we’re having breakfast or dinner together as the entire family, even though we’re always looked peaceful outside, those trivial events actually are a political battlefield for us elders to extend our influence! This lowly man himself used a few move in the past during breakfast to gather like-minded men under my banner. I used all my resources and connections in a single mealtime to attack my rivals! However, these past two days, my biggest rival used a lowly method against me…”</p>\n<p>“Oh? What did he do?” Butler Tim asked.</p>\n<p>“He didn’t do much,” Elder Jhamil said, sneering when he was talking about this rival of his, “all he did was inviting Young Lady Bhela everytime we were having a meal in the family hall. He’s been a stubborn and ignorant supporter of main family, but this time he actually knew how to use his connection with the main family to deal a blow against me. A few of the elders had been faltering when they saw Young Lady Bhela leaning over the other side; I’m afraid if we’re leaving this ignorant rival of me doing as he wanted, there’s gonna be a hole in Sir Butler’s smart plan!”</p>\n<p>Butler Tim swirled the tea in his cup as though he was deep in thought. Of course, if this proven to endanger his smart plan, the butler couldn’t sit still watching all that happened. “I heard the Mossacks are peculiar people, but I don’t know you Mossack people have a strange custom!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, we’re living here far away from the city, so of course our traditions might seem unsophisticated to wise westerners like Sir Butler,” Elder Jhamil fawned.</p>\n<p>“Then what do you suggest Blackwood Family should do in this situation, Elder Jhamil?”</p>\n<p>“It’s easy!” Elder Jhamil was so excited he almost jumped from his seat. “My rival faction used Young Lady Bhela to gain foothold, and we can also use that to deal a greater blow back to them!”</p>\n<p>“And that is?”</p>\n<p>“Of course, we can use--I mean, we can invite young noble miss to a dinner together with us. With this we can unofficially announce our alliance with Blackwood Family! It’s the final nail to main family’s faction!”</p>\n<p>Even though Bhela Malikh’s status as a Unique Class shone throughout all of Badril Village, her name still fall short with a pure noble like Lyla Blackwood. Madam back in Blackwood Family used her daughter so Blackwood could infiltrate Malikh Family easily, but that didn’t mean Lyla still wasn’t as useful.</p>\n<p>“Very well. Let us go with that,” then he asked the maid responsible for Lyla’s schedule. “What was Young Lady Lyla doing this afternoon?”</p>\n<p>The maid replied, “Young Lady Bhela Malikh carried her around to play. At first, they went to Malikh Family’s orchard to pick some fruits. Then they visited the sick Patriarch Malikh in his room for a few minutes. After that, they went outside to stroll and came back with a new rabbit pet they bought from other family. Finally, when the sun is setting, they went to the kitchen to watch the servants cooking.”</p>\n<p>“How uncouth for a noble young lady being led around in dirty places like that,” Butler Tim was displeased, but nothing he could do since making Bhela’s attention elsewhere meant he could move freely to make a trap for her. Nodding to himself, the butler then gave an instruction to the maid, “you go to Young Lady Lyla and tell that Malikh Family invite her for a dinner.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was excitedly rubbing his hands when Butler Tim said that. Finally, payback to those imbecile Elder Khasim!</p>\n<p>“But, Butler Tim…” the maid hesitated.</p>\n<p>“What is it?”</p>\n<p>“Malikh Family already invited Young Lady Lyla to have dinner. She’s eating in Malikh Family’s hall right now….”</p>\n<p>“Hmm, what do you mean?”</p>\n<p>What the maid meant was that someone in Malikh Family already brought Lyla to have dinner with them.</p>\n<p>When Butler Tim playing political games and scheming around in Malikh Family, Bhela Malikh, along with the elders friendly with Elder Khasim, had been giving bunch of candies and food for Lyla Blackwood, much more than the biscuits Butler Tim brought with him. Being a great foodie herself, Lyla never had enough, the first day in Malikh Family she ate more sweets and foods worth of one week back in Blackwood Family’s manor. Aunt Jiji and other Blackwood Family’s maid servants would freak out if they saw how glutton Lyla currently was.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the news that the main family’s faction hosting a dinner for a noble miss swept Malikh Family like a thunderstorm. The neutral elders Elder Jhamil had just bought flocking back toward Elder Khasim’s side. It was so sudden. Everyone wasn’t even got a breath to process what had happened. And this for sure was an unprecedented move ever since Patriarch Ghalim suddenly fell ill and retreated from the political scene.</p>\n<p>Just as one side was busy completing the first stage to win over the Young Lady of Malikh Family, the other side already won over Young Lady of the noble Blackwood Family. All happened in a span of a single day.</p>\n<p>“Y-young Lady Lyla…”</p>\n<p>Even Butler Tim couldn’t pull his own young miss seeing how happy she was. His plan had been jabbed in a completely unexpected way. Maybe he wasn’t so smart after all.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>It was unfortunate that Madam Malikh didn’t see the Young Noble Miss of Blackwood Family kindly. Even though the girl did nothing wrong, Madam Malikh wasn’t so muddled that she wasn’t aware what Blackwood Family and those corrupt elders conspiring against her husband and Malikh’s main family. Even Bhela herself couldn’t do anything to change her mother’s mind.</p>\n<p>However, Lyla Blackwood, an airhead as she always was, was oblivious of the hostility directed toward her.</p>\n<p>It was morning the second day Lyla in Badril Village. Following her friend Bhela, she carried a little box inside Patriarch Ghalim’s bedroom. This little box filled with custom-made medicines--most were amateurly mixed from two different trivial medicines, consisted of remedies for flu and headache. Nothing harmful but nothing useful at the same time. And just like yesterday, to pay for Bhela parents’ kindness for letting her staying in Malikh Family, Lyla Blackwood decided to play doctor a little bit.</p>\n<p>“Uncle, I’m coming again to help you feel better,” Lyla said as she dragged a chair and sat beside Patriarch Ghalim’s sick bed. Seeing the pale middle-aged man in bed, she blinked her googly eyes, then continued, “how’s yesterday medicine I gave you. Are you feeling a tiny minny bit better, perhaps?”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim certainly was feeling better these past few days, not because Lyla’s medicines, but Grandpa Piss’s diagnosis and remedies. Toward this girl, he weakly nodded. “Thank you for your help, little lady.”</p>\n<p>“Then I’m going to fed you my newest recipe, uncle. Here, here, open your mouth.”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghamil did what he was told. Because Lyla didn’t like bitter medicine, she added lots of brown sugar. Lots and lots of brown sugar.</p>\n<p>“It’s… sweet.”</p>\n<p>“Are you feeling better, now?” Lyla asked.</p>\n<p>“Yes, little lady, I’m feeling better.”</p>\n<p>As a matter of fact, he wasn’t. The medicine was more like a candy than remedy.</p>\n<p>“Good! If you eat this three times a day, maybe your illness would go away, uncle,” Lyla then sternly pointed out, “maybe!”</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh was nervous when her husband consumed the strange medicine Lyla gave him, but she didn’t open her mouth to protest. Bhela was changing the pillows’ sheet nearby, and doing some other chores that usually were done by the servants. In the meantime, Lyla was giving advice for Patriarch Ghalim liked how he should eat moderately three times a day, how he should brush his teeth after he ate sweets, and all the things Aunt Jiji told Lyla all the time.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to visit again, uncle, get well soon!” Lyla waved her hands. Carrying a broom in her hands, Lyla’s next schedule was following Bhela doing chores in the courtyard.</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim weakly waved his hand back. Of course, after the girls were already gone, he noticed his bitter wife biting her lips indignantly.</p>\n<p>“Don’t stare the girl so much. She’s not responsible for her family’s wrongdoings. It’s not like a girl her age knows what her parents do behind the scene.”</p>\n<p>“Why did you eat that? What if they used her to give you more poison?”</p>\n<p>“Bhela wouldn’t let me have the medicine if she didn’t what it was, no? Stop putting that kind of face, you only make our daughter feels awkward about all this.”</p>\n<p>The woman held her husband’s hand, kissing it with her forehead as she hid her face. She whispered, “Oh, don’t you know how hurt this heart holding back my grievance? Why did our daughter had to bring someone from that family inside our roof?” she sniffed, “how long this farce gonna last? What should I do in the mean time? Oh! I don’t know! I don’t know!”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim sighed as he witnessed his wife cried helplessly.</p>\n<p>In the courtyard, near the coops where Malikh Family raised chickens and ducks, Lyla was squatting in front of the new bunny she and Bhela bought just yesterday. She was waiting the whole morning just to feed this bunny. The bunny hopped around, itching to play in spite it couldn’t resist the temptation of delicious green leaves, again and again. Wathing how glutton the bunny was, Lyla found herself immerse in immense joy. She very much envying the life of a bunny. Perhaps that because she could relate to how it spent its day without worry; eating, playing, sleeping, then playing again--a life that she longed to have. If only she was born a rabbit instead of a young lady of noble family….</p>\n<p>The sound of the broom swept the ground took away her attention. Lyla couldn’t understand how a daughter of a patriarch like Bhela had to work so much.</p>\n<p>“Why do you work so much, Sistah?” Lyla asked when she found out there still much dry leaves Bhela had to sweep. “Won’t you get bored soon? Just let the servants clean this place.”</p>\n<p>Bhela, sweeping as if Lyla’s idleness didn’t bother her the slightest, replied, “Here in Badril Village, everyone who hasn’t done their coming of age ceremony has to do chores for their parents. It doesn’t matter if it’s the farmer’s daughter or the biggest family’s young lady, helping the matter of the household is one of the seven virtues we Mossack people get to do for our parents.”</p>\n<p>Originally, Lyla wanted her friend also playing with the bunny. But hearing Bhela just said something serious, there was no way she’d reveal her intention now. “My mom always nagging me to go to dance lesson or whatever. It’s very very boring,” she murmured, a bit dejected.</p>\n<p>“The west and the south have different values,” Bhela said. “Complete your virtue for your parents then you’ll grow to be a fine lady, Lyla.”</p>\n<p>“Uggghhh…” Lyla grunted as she didn’t want to continue the topic any further. She long developed a sense for her own survival to detect whether or not the conversation ended up she being forced to do some boring stuff. Knowing Bhela’s personality, Lyla knew soon Sis Bhela’d make her doing chores too. Grabbing the bunny, Lyla quickly escaped somewhere else so that she could spend her time playing. Bhela shook her head seeing the girl’s behavior.</p>\n<p>Bhela then noticed some servants whispering while they looking at Lyla from the distance. Many people were curious what a noble young lady like her would do in a rural place like this, and Bhela wasn’t that oblivious not to notice the eyes planted by the elders of Malikh Family.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, she then saw four girls dressed in expensive garments approaching Lyla with their mouth covered with feathered fans in their hands. Their clothing looked as if they attending some sort of ceremony, while in fact, they calculated that this kind of appearance was the most suitable for them to socialize with a girl of blue-blooded origin. Bhela recognized the leader of those girls was actually Elder Jhamil’s niece.</p>\n<p>“Have you read Le Armour dan Varoza written by Leornador De Gonzalez, Young Lady Blackwood?”</p>\n<p>“Ah, yes, that piece was adequately sophisticated but I think Vista van Gracious’s omnibus more than adequate, le banjour?”</p>\n<p>“I see, I see, their pieces adequately well-written as those senor themselves adequattely live as maestro. But perhaps equoliette more than fit the diagram as paradigm sensorita abligioate senor des adequately le banjour.”</p>\n<p>“But of course, Young Lady Blackwood is more addequately sophisitacted as it’s a noblesse obligiote to be more sohpisitacated than us village senioritas. Perhaps le banjour is fortuna with de gracious by Young Lady’s great wisdom?”</p>\n<p>Lyla blinked her eyes trying to decipher whatever these girls mean. The bunny in her arms even escaped amidst her confusion.</p>\n<p>“Uhh… uhhh…” Lyla timidly stepped back from the feathered fan girls. “I think Sis Bhela is calling me…”</p>\n<p>She swiftly ran away back to her friend Bhela.</p>\n<p>“Sistah, Sistah Bhela!” Lyla cried and grabbing Bhela’s sloven sleeve tightly, demanding for justice, “they came to bully me!”</p>\n<p>“What did they do?” Bhela asked.</p>\n<p>“They know I can’t speak western language! They came to test me! They’re even worse than those rich girls in seminar--they jumble some western mumbo jumbo into plain language in order to confuse me! They must be laughing and call me stupid by now!”</p>\n<p>Hearing Lyla’s grievance, Bhela patted her head in order to let the girl calmed down.</p>\n<p>“Lyla, those girls are different than the noble girls that always making fun of you.”</p>\n<p>“Different? How so?”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at the girls who also was watching them back while fanning themselves with their fabulous feathered fans.</p>\n<p>“They looked like noble descendants, but actually were not.”</p>\n<p>“I still don’t like them nonetheless!”</p>\n<p>“You don’t have to talk to them if you don’t want to,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>Yet Lyla still restlessly tugging Bhela’s sleeves, making it harder for her to do her chores. Before the peers that always making fun of her, Lyla was always helpless and had been depending on Bhela’s figure as a shield. What it looked like from the point of view of an outsider was a scene where a young mother being tested of her patience dealing with a girl who was throwing a tantrum.</p>\n<p>Seeing that the young noble miss wouldn’t come back soon, the feathered fan girls approaching Bhela and Lyla instead.</p>\n<p>“Oh, fancy to meet Young Lady Bhela here, le banjour!”</p>\n<p>“Le bonjour…” Bhela hesitated to reply back. Tilting her head slightly, she studied the pompously dressed girls before her. These girls were relatives of Malikh Family’s elders. None of them could match with Bhela if talking strictly about social status wise, not to mention talents. However, while she was holding her broom, it looked like Bhela was the one with common origin, while these girls were floating swans who happened to be generous enough to greet plebeians with their <em>unique</em> vocabulary.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Lyla Blackwood hid behind Lyla’s back. Despite a noble origin herself, meeting more cocky and fake young ladies than the girls before her were rare experience for Lyla.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela, fancy to meet you. Good morning. The weather is nice. I eat snails everyday,” Elder Jhamil’s niece took the lead and said that with a hint of inflated pride.</p>\n<p>Bhela narrowed her eyes. She could see why Lyla instantly hated these girls. She then said in a sleek foreign language, “Je ne sais pas de quoi tu parles. Si vous ne parlez pas une langue étrangère, fermez simplement la bouche, sinon vous faites peur aux enfants avec votre non-sens.”</p>\n<p>The feathered fan girls blinked their eyes trying to decipher whatever Bhela had said.</p>\n<p>“Oh, it turns out Young Lady Bhela is aquadettely know some le banjour!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, Young Lady Bhela is adequately sophisticated after all. Me gusta!”</p>\n<p>“I see, I see, le pasta fortuna is delicosaza.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s niece didn’t say anything as she only maintained a sweet smile while being nervous herself. Racking her brains over remembering the contents of thick dictionary, she tried to form a decent sentences in foreign language. But Bhela then cut off her train of thought before she could say a word.</p>\n<p>“Blackwood Family is migrating noble that has long been making their roots here in southern land. Hundred of years living far away from their western peers, noble families like this would naturally become more lax. It’s natural for Lyla to not mastering her homeland’s native tongue.”</p>\n<p>Bhela said that in a straight manner. That was a white lie, however. It was true that many noble families coming from the western side of Tiramikal Continent to forgot their western root and began to see themselves as southerners. But those were usually the case depending right circumstances, like exiled nobles, or some young masters who had lost in political battle branched out and fancied themselves a legit noble family with themselves at the helm. Blackwood Family weren’t exiled nobles, and though Lyla’s ancestors branching out some hundreds of years ago, that didn’t automatically made them cutting off ties with the original family. The main family of Blackwood was back in a western country called Tatalghia Kingdom, still sending letters and envoys from time to time to the branch Lyla was living in--although, undeniably, the southern branch of Blackwood Family had long developed and surpassed the main one.</p>\n<p>It seemed like Bhela already used to tell this lie. Anyone who heard this would be forced to accept it, unless they wanted to spend time and resources digging through the details--which to be honest, none of these pompous young girls were willing or simply unable to go through.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Elder Jhamil’s niece believed Lyla’s family exempt her to excel in foreign language. Yet she was still displeased inside. Her uncle told her that Bhela had been hogging the young noble’s influence for herself, everyone in Malikh Family already knew how Bhela Malikh carrying around the noble young lady yesterday. So what if she had some more bit of talent and had been running around overseas in that whatever seminars she was attending? A bumpkin origin wouldn’t be able to change their bumpkin bloodline. So if Bhela had the right to get close with the Young Lady of Blackwood Family, that meant someone coming from the same family should have the same change as her!</p>\n<p>The elder’s niece said, “Young Lady Bhela, I know the main family is prideful. But Young Lady Blackwood is here to experience the village slow life. Don’t you think she also needs to mingle with us commoners?”</p>\n<p>“Lyla will befriend any person she fancies herself, I don’t control with whom she wants to socialize with,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“If that’s the case, then why she still has no friends other than you?”</p>\n<p>“That’s not true!” Lyla cried indignantly, “I’ve made friends! With aunties! Aunties in the kitchen!”</p>\n<p>It was easy to be friendly with Lyla. She was always unconventional and never saw people by the social system. To her, people only divided by two types, those who gave her food and those who didn’t. She was like a cat. Just bring a good food and she’d be very friendly the next moment.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Lyla’s frank open-mindedness wasn’t easily accepted by some people. Elder Jhamil’s niece gasped as she looked at Lyla and Bhela, back and forth. “My goodness! Young Lady Bhela, were you letting a noble young lady such as Young Lady Blackwood mingle with dirty servants?!”</p>\n<p>“Why wouldn’t I?” Bhela asked back.</p>\n<p>“You--don’t young lady care about our family’s reputation? What if people said we’ve mistreated a noble young lady?”</p>\n<p>“Lyla is here to experience village slow life,” Bhela said slowly, “don’t you think she also needs to mingle with commoners?”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s niece was speechless as Bhela used her own words. The contorted expression on her chaky make-up face brought satisfaction for Lyla, who then snorted.</p>\n<p>“What now? Kitty got your tongue?” Lyla said with her mouth pouted. “So that you know, Sis Bhela already made speechless many many bullies like you! Who were many many many times smarter than you! This is what you get by making fun of me--shame on you, hmph! Who’s the stupid one, now?”</p>\n<p>Even after losing a round of squabble against Young Lady Bhela, unexpectedly the nobly young lady herself became hostile against her. All was so sudden that it made blood drained from her face.</p>\n<p>Bhela ruffled Lyla’s hair. Apparently Lyla still believed these girls came to bully her. When Lyla already made up her mind to not liking someone, it was hard to bend on her opinion.</p>\n<p>“Let’s go, Lyla. We’ll help aunties make sweets for afternoon lunch,” Bhela said. Back in the seminars, when Bhela asked Lyla to do some chores, the supposed noble young lady of Blackwood Family would move slowly, occasionally pouting and murmuring some complaints, unwilling to exert her calories on some boring stuff. However, it was different if the destination was kitchen. The spirit of lively bunny would come to possess her--she’d jolt, sprinting, unwilling to waste time as the promise of free sweets and delicious salty snacks was revealed before her.</p>\n<p>“What was that about?!” one of the le bonjour girls scowled after Bhela and Lyla was gone. “How could a young lady speaks like that?”</p>\n<p>“Bhela must lead her around to act like that! Did you hear what she said? The noble young lady thinks we bully her or something.”</p>\n<p>“Aahhh! What a manipulative bitch! I really want to know what that little cunt said to make Young Lady Blackwood think we had made fun of her. No way in hell someone would dare making fun of a noble like her!”</p>\n<p>Actually, Lyla was made fun of so many times. Especially during her study in the seminars abroad. She made fun of so much that she formed a survival instinct to hide behind Bhela’s back. But they didn’t know that. They just assumed as a young lady coming from a noble family, Lyla Blackwood would be adequately pure noble in stories and gossip. The main reason Bhela brought Lyla away was so that Lyla didn’t have to mingle with these delusional le bonjour girls.</p>\n<hr>\n","volume-6/chapter-62":"<p>When the news about what happened in Malikh Family’s ngajen ceremony arrived at Blackwood Family, Madam Blackwood was so enraged she broke the tea cup she held onto the floor. Establishing the family’s foot in Badril Village was supposed to be easy, but not only he failed to gain the support of Malikh Family and the villagers, the Young Master of Blackwood Family somehow managed to incite the bedridden patriarch’s supporters to regain their lost foothold against the corrupt Malikh Family’s elders.</p>\n<p>“There’s no point keeping him in that rural village,” Madam Blackwood said. She was a flamboyant, late thirty years old woman whose beauty was so superior that the previous viscount adopt her as a daughter. “Call Frane back to the city, he’s going to spend two months training in capital!”</p>\n<p>The butler who was waiting for her bowed and went away to carry out the task.</p>\n<p>“How’s Lyla’s birthday party going?”</p>\n<p>“Reply to madam, the party has started, the guests who came only from baron nobilities and mid-rank merchants,” a maid replied.</p>\n<p>The madam glanced the timid middle-aged man who sat on the same table as her. She scoffed, saying, “Look how your daughter made a name for herself. Not only the bribe money was wasted away, she coming on trips in the seminars only resulting her made a fool out of herself! Hah, like father, like daughter! Imbecile!”</p>\n<p>Madam Blackwood hurled the new cup that recently poured with hot, scalding tea. She purposely aimed at the table so the hot water splashed on the viscount’s hands. The timid viscount didn’t make a sound when his hands getting burnt, he didn’t dare to fight against his wife. It was already ten years too late for him to retaliate in any way. From the way he dragged his limping leg to fetch damp towel for his scaling skin, it was clear the waiting servants already used to ignore him.</p>\n<p>Recently, his wife’s mood had became the worst ever since their youngest daughter came back from the two years seminars. Unlike Frane--who only registered as his son by blood in papers, Lyla hadn’t show any particular talents in becoming a Class worthy of a noble family. She had a decent progress speed, a Level 7 Novice after seminars, but that progress mainly because she never had the interest to train herself. Madam Blackwood had bribed the officials so Lyla could enter the seminars supposed to boost her standing in high society, so she could catch higher ranking nobles eyes somehow. However, that plan failed in the worst way that could happen to a noble family like the Blackwood. She made blunders and broke rules so many times that she became a laughing stock. The only families that interested in her only lower rank nobles and not-so well off merchant families.</p>\n<p>“There also no point keeping that useless girl forever in the mansion,” Madam Blackwood said. “Send her to Badril Village by tomorrow. Make some smart men tending to her needs--they have to smart enough to know how to reel those Malikh villagers to say yes when I send my words in the future!”</p>\n<p>After the son’s failure, the madam would send her daughter, to do nothing but play around in Malikh Family. Even if there was something the girl could do, the madam surely wouldn’t choose this daughter of hers who she deemed too brainless to do even the simplest tasks. Her daughter was just that useless to her. The one with received the orders were people who accompanied her, who had experience in bribing and coercing. They were tasked to devour Malikh Family from the inside. The Blackwood would surely corner Bhela Malikh this time.</p>\n<p>Somewhere else, in a colorless courtyard, a birthday party already went on for about two hours. Most guests already leaving, not unlike the year before the two-years seminars happened when the sons of noble families dallying around waiting for a chance to talk with the young lady. Today, the Young Lady of Blackwood Family turned fourteen, two years before she would considered mature, but this young miss still pouting her mouth like a little girl.</p>\n<p>The old handmaid saw her young lady was bored and offered a treat.</p>\n<p>“Young lady, try this cake. A certain famous bakery made this just for your birthday.”</p>\n<p>The cake served on a small plate along with a silver fork. The girl took only mere seconds to finish it.</p>\n<p>“Is it good?” the handmaid asked.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t matter if it’s good or not, Aunt Jiji, I still hungry with this tiny minny bit of cake! Let me eat that one!” the girl pointed at the layered cake served on the center of the party.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Lyla, you can’t!”</p>\n<p>“Why can’t I?!”</p>\n<p>“You must present yourself as a proper young lady, so you can’t!”</p>\n<p>The cake was to be portioned to serve for the same amount of guests since the last party, but because the Blackwood Family’s young lady had a bad reputation in the seminars, most invited families didn’t actually come.</p>\n<p>“But I can’t be a lady if I’m hungry, am I?”</p>\n<p>“You must learn the way. Be patient, Young Lady Lyla!”</p>\n<p>“But I am huuungriiiiieeeehhh!!!”</p>\n<p>Aunt Jiji was terrified when she realized the young lady wasn’t referred only to portion of the cake, but she wanted to eat the whole cake. This shorty girl, although her feature was thin with only her cheeks got plump, actually had a talent to be a terrifying glutton that would be seen in Tiramikal Continent every one hundred years. It was a useless talent that brought only shame to Blackwood Family.</p>\n<p>It was fortunate that before the young lady could make a big ruckus, a maidservant came to bring the news about the madam’s decision. Aunt Jiji passed it to the young lady immediately.</p>\n<p>“You heard that, young lady! Madam is going to send you for a vacation!”</p>\n<p>Lyla’s head straightened, she forgot to pout. “Vacation? Where? Where where?”</p>\n<p>“To Badril Village!”</p>\n<p>“Badril Village?” the girl tilted her head. “Where’s that?”</p>\n<p>“If you promise Aunt Jiji not to eat too much cake today, Aunt Jiji will tell you where it is…”</p>\n<p>“I will if it turned out somewhere fun!”</p>\n<p>“Badril Village is where Young Lady Bhela’s home place!”</p>\n<p>“Sis Bhela’s home?!” Lyla gasped, “yahoooo!!!”</p>\n<p>Ignoring that she was the center of attention, Lyla suddenly jumped and danced like no tomorrow. Aunt Jiji tried to stop her, but it was futile since Lyla only promised not to be glutton. The remaining guests began whispering with each other. They were people who doubted the rumors about this Young Lady Blackwood, but after seeing how childish and ridiculous the girl danced, people were finally convinced. How was this a viscount’s daughter supposed to act? The girl danced her hips and hopped around like a bunny that had an itchy bum. Soon, the Young Lady Lyla Blackwood fell to the bottom list of desired young ladies to marry. Her reputation fell from not-so-smart, to stupid, and then fell again to brainless and imbecile. People didn’t see her in a good light. But that just how a girl named Lyla Blackwood really was.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Yashura Family got a peculiar visitor these past two days. He introduced himself as an expert from overseas, and somehow this foreign expert became interested in Shira Yashura. When the story leaked by insiders from Yashura Family, people were scratching their heads, wondering what could an educated man saw from this trash who could only get himself to level 3 Novice. Some people even sneered, saying that whole news was just Yashura Family’s little trick to clear up rumors from their heir’s name.</p>\n<p>“You understand, kiddo? There are three mandatory rules if someone wants to meet privately with me. First rule, it’s a <em>she</em>, not <em>he</em>. Second rule, big boobs. Third rule, in her lower part, there must be big bubbly butts, as big as her boobs. <em>Anything</em> lesser than that you can just send them back to wherever they came from.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit said that as he moved his chess piece, eating one of Shira’s pawns.</p>\n<p>“And remember, my standard is pretty high. Consult with how loadful those girls from Big-Boobed Sect are for more information,” the Nalaq continued.</p>\n<p>“Please don’t talk nonsense. I’m being serious here,” Shira said.</p>\n<p>“Ey, I’m not talking nonsense. The girls from Big-Boobed Sect are real deal, okay? They’re huge! If you don’t believe me then you should go to Elzhier Family one of these days, go check out how glorious their boobs are. They always dance or become the maidservants when they’re not on duties.”</p>\n<p>“Ol’ Good-Natured Spirit… I don’t want to hear this imaginary all-woman sect of yours. Elzhier Family is only a normal rural family, they don’t host any sect members within their walls. If they did, the Village Head would boast about it at my uncle’s face every single day.”</p>\n<p>“You just don’t believe it because you never see how great they are--their boobs, I mean. How great those melons inside tight suits are! Just think about it; leather suits and melons--two entirely different things but if they come together they’d jiggling in harmony. This Good-Natured Spirit approved their sense of style.”</p>\n<p>“Forget about it, it’s not important--”</p>\n<p>“Boobs are important, ey!”</p>\n<p>Shira waved his hand as he didn’t want to continue this nonsense. He then moved a piece and finished his turn. He returned the topic back again, “The expert said he came from a first-tier faction called Blue Robe Society. If we can get his faction’s recognition then at least my family can silence all those rumors about me--especially the recent ones, they really are becoming a pain in the ass.”</p>\n<p>“I told you. I don’t talk with guys. No boobs, no good. Period.”</p>\n<p>“You are really becoming a pain in the ass,” Shira complained.</p>\n<p>After Shira said that, Good-Natured Spirit’s knight jumped over a wall of pawns to get on his bishop. Within a single breath Shira immediately moved his rook, creating a chain reaction that exposes the Nalaq’s defence, resulting his king trapped in three different direction.</p>\n<p>“Check mate.”</p>\n<p>“Ey, what the fu--” Good-Natured Spirit rage quit, flipping the chess board. “Hah! I knew it! You brat, you intentionally make me talk about boobs in order to lower my guard, right?! Fuck! That is how it is, isn’t it?!”</p>\n<p>“No, it is not.”</p>\n<p>“You sneaky bastard. You really got me,” Good-Natured Spirit threw his hands up in the air. <br>\n“Man, I surrender, that is some sick psychological tactic you got there.”</p>\n<p>“Now I don’t really know what you’re talking about.”</p>\n<p>Good-Natured Spirit waved his hands in surrender, then he lit a cigarette. “Anyway, what do you want from me this time? Money again? I prepared some kobe coins enough for you to buy some candy, here, take this.”</p>\n<p>Shira shoved back the coin bag. “Not today. I just want you to meet Sir Baront Staterwind.”</p>\n<p>“No boobs, no good. Ask something else. How about I tell you the secret place where are those Big-Boobed Sect girls take their bath, ‘ey? Seems fair deal to me.”</p>\n<p>“How many times do I have to tell you--”</p>\n<p>“Sssshhh!!” Good-Natured Spirit hushed the boy. He then whispered, “you hear that?”</p>\n<p>Because the Nalaq suddenly became vigilant, Shira instinctively lowered his voice too. “Hear what?” he asked.</p>\n<p>“I heard some rats watching us…” the Nalaq covered his mouth, as if he didn’t want people to read lips what he said next, “some big-boobed rats…”</p>\n<p>“Huh… what?”</p>\n<p>“The girls from Big-Boobed Sect… they’re here…”</p>\n<p>“The heck are you talking about? This hill is Yashura Family’s property--”</p>\n<p>“Sssshhhh! They’ve noticed me noticing them. Wait here, I’mma get you some melons for your reward!”</p>\n<p>After he saying that, Good-Natured Spirit’s figure melting into the thin air.</p>\n<p>Shira Yashura sighed. At times, asking favor to this vulgar Nalaq not only difficult, it also unpredictable he’d only incite troubles if he not careful.</p>\n<p>After his winning streak for more than half a year maybe he became cocky. He forgot the Nalaq wasn’t there to solve his problem whenever he wanted, although the Nalaq sort of ended up like that after a few months he came here. Shira got some thinking, maybe he should stop seeing this Nalaq as his convenient piggy bank for his own good.</p>\n<p>“Really, he always making a mess for me to clean. I wonder if such thoughtless Nalaqs like him are common around here… now, where’s the last piece again?” he sighed for the second time.</p>\n<p>When he was picking up chess pieces that board Good-Natured Spirit flipped earlier, Shira realized there was a missing piece. Turned out it was stuck in the hole between tree roots.</p>\n<p>He plunged his hand to look for the missing chess piece.</p>\n<p>“Ugh… my fingers can’t reach.”</p>\n<p>He tried to squirm his body to fit his hand in.</p>\n<p>“Where is it again?”</p>\n<p>He frowned. He squirmed his body again really hard.</p>\n<p>“Oh, there it--”</p>\n<p><em>BOOOOOMMMMM!!!!</em></p>\n<p>An explosion happened not far away from the place he used to hang out, creating a wave of rolling dust that swept over the hill. Shira got his hand stuck between the tree rots, he could only hugged his head with his free hand and waited for the shockwave to finish. The chess pieces he gathered already nowhere to be found. He cooked up his head, looking left and right, and saw the greeny grasses were covered with dirts and trees were uprooted. The whole hill became a shithole kind of mess.</p>\n<p>Before the boy could swallow what was going on, a chuckle could be heard near him. Before him, Good-Natured Spirit emerged, coiling around the Nalaq’s body were purple-colored living flames that hungrily tried to eat him whole.</p>\n<p>As carefree as he usually was, Good-Natured Spirit said with a grin, “Those Big-Boobed Sect girls sure are feisty. They’re escaping too fast, I can’t get you melons. I managed to get a feeling of their butts, though. Here, there’s some fragrant left behind.”</p>\n<p>Shira stepped back when the Nalaq offered his palm. It was still on fire, the boy didn’t want to get burn along with him. Besides, he didn’t want to get involved with the Nalaq’s deprived hobby.</p>\n<p>“Sure you don’t want it?” Good-Natured Spirit took a last sniff from his palm, followed by a low chuckle of his.</p>\n<p>“Good-Natured Spirit… what’s that fire?”</p>\n<p>“Yeah? Dunno, man. Exorcism flame or something.”</p>\n<p>“Ohh… oh, it’s very nice to know you up until know. Good bye.”</p>\n<p>“Hmm? You want to go somewhere?” Realizing the purple flame was getting annoying, Good-Natured Spirit then patted away the coiling flame from his shoulders like it was nothing.</p>\n<p>Shira shrugged his shoulders. It seemed this bastard Nalaq was too tough for that exorcism flame. Maybe the flame was too ordinary? Whatever, he didn’t care about that anymore. His eyes then swept the ruin around him. He said, “You can’t forget about the meeting for today. But please clean the mess you made yourself.”</p>\n<p>“That’s what you want for the chess reward?”</p>\n<p>Shira nodded.</p>\n<p>“Aye, aye, will do.” Good-Natured Spirit flicked his fingers, and human-sized paper cranes came out of thin air. They were obedient, not clear whether were monsters or just magical devices. The paper cranes used magnet-like magic to carry the messy uprooted trees and boulders, along with sweeping the dirt from the grass. The cleaning up might take a while, since the hill really was a mess. Shira, feeling a little light on the head, facepalming as he returned back to Yashura Family.</p>\n<p>The whole explosion could be heard from all over Badril Village. It wasn’t clear what its cause, but Yashura Family sent guards to prevent people from knowing what really happened. In Yashura Family’s guest hall, Patriarch Shuro Yashura, a few good Yashura Family elders, and the respected visitor, Sir Baront Staterwind, forming a circle as they sat cross-legged, discussing the explosion that had just occurred.</p>\n<p>“Good elders, Sir Patriarch Yashura, I know you must get excited when I said Young Master Shira has some talent in communicating with Nalaqs. However, a Nalaq still a Nalaq. You must not offend a Nalaq whatsoever, or the consequence is dire! Young Master Shira’s life is way more important than getting a qualification to enter my school!” Sir Baront Staterwind warned. His forehead was still wet with sweat, since he hurriedly ran to Yashura Family when he realized the direction of recent explosion.</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, you’re right, Sir Staterwind. Absolutely right! I already sent someone to check on my nephew’s condition, please calm down,” Patriarch Shuro said.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront shook his head. “You don’t really know what I’m trying to say, do you? You should prepare a very good healer or a doctor, Patriarch Shuro, because if it isn’t death, one can easily lose a limb over angering a Nalaq! That happens more often than you think!”</p>\n<p>The elders drew cold breaths in unison when they heard that. Patriarch Shuro, whose face already pale, becoming even whiter than a sheet of paper. If they boy lost a limb, Shira’s chance to succeed him as the next patriarch could be swept away like specks of dust.</p>\n<p>Yulong the Butler arrived. Everyone in the room had been anxiously waiting for him they instinctively stood up when Yulong approached.</p>\n<p>“Yulong, how’s Shira doing?” Patriarch Shuro asked.</p>\n<p>Yulong replied, “Young Master Shira is back, patriarch. But Madam Yashura sent him to the kitchen for a second breakfast.”</p>\n<p>“Breakfast? What’s a breakfast has something to do with that explosion? Can he still walk?”</p>\n<p>“He’s walking fine, Patriarch Yashura.”</p>\n<p>“Then, Yulong, please go fetch my nephew for me, we have something urgent to tell him!”</p>\n<p>After his trained elegant bow, Yulong stepped back and proceeded to do the task given to him.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront Staterwind peered at the butler’s back. He traveled southern lands many times, visiting many villages, yet, he seldom heard a Mossack descent major family employed western-style butler. What made him confused even more that Sir Kurusiya apparently knew the butler and gave his respect to him, which Sir Baront Staterwind didn’t expect that coming from the cold eastern Kaya swordsman.</p>\n<p>“Dear good elder,” Sir Baront Staterwind asked a random elder who sat beside him, “may I know why there’s a butler working here?”</p>\n<p>“Is Sir referring to Yulong? Yulong isn’t actually working for Yashura Family, but Young Master Shira’s mother’s attendant. I can’t tell you the details, so forgive me sir, all I can say is Young Master Shira’s father is exceedingly brave and awesome he managed to woo a respectable lady many years ago.”</p>\n<p>“Ahhh…” Sir Baront nodded. The boy apparently a result of his parent eloping. The Blue Robe Society expert of course knew etiquette to hold himself from digging the story further.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, Yulong came back with Shira followed behind. The boy wore new clothes since his previous one was dirty. When he saw the group of elders and the expert guest looking at him, Shira sighed inside his heart. He knew he had to clean Good-Natured Spirit’s mess once again.</p>\n<p>“Greetings, elders… greetings, uncle patriarch… greetings, Sir Staterwind…”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro impatiently treading forward. “Shira my boy, is it true that you lost your limbs?”</p>\n<p>“I’m unhurt, uncle, see?” Shira waved both of his hands to prove that his limbs still functioned as they should be.</p>\n<p>“Oh! God, thank God! Really! These are really your hands, aren’t they? Not a fake one made with wood?” Patriarch Shuro Yashura grabbed his nephew hands and waved it around like a child playing with flags.</p>\n<p>“Young Master Shira,” Sir Baront opened his mouth, “I reckon you failed to ask the Nalaq to meet me? If you can’t do it, young master, it best for you not to push him any further. Today, you offend him and he blast the hill behind your Yashura Family as a warning, but what happens if you make the same mistake tomorrow?”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Shuro nodded at his words vigorously. “Sir Baront is right, Shira my boy. A Nalaq is a revered being ancient Mossacks worshiped as their guardian angel. The consequence of making them mad is very dire! You should know better, my boy, you should’ve told your uncle if a Nalaq came to you the first time!”</p>\n<p>Sir Baront and his uncle Patriarch Shuro had good intentions in telling him about how to be respectful to a Nalaq. But the more Shira heard their warning, the more he doubted about Good-Natured Spirit being a “revered” Nalaq like they said. Of course, saying the truth about the explosion’s true cause resulting only Yashura Family losing face in front of Sir Baront Staterwind. Shira had no choice, he had to tread the matter very carefully.</p>\n<p>“<em>Cough, cough</em>… Uncle, Sir Baront, thank you for your concern. Truth is, it wasn’t that the Nalaq being mad that causes the explosion, but there was some… accident… that happened right before.”</p>\n<p>“With what title do you usually call him, Young Master Shira?” Sir Baront asked.</p>\n<p>“As far as I know, he doesn’t have a title. At least he didn’t tell me if he ever had one. He told me to call him ‘Good-Natured Spirit’.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, with that kind of nickname, he must be a very benevolent person when he was alive,” Sir Baront concluded as he rubbed his beard. “So, Young Master Shira, it seems he didn’t really intent to blast into smithereens.”</p>\n<p>Shira nodded. That part was true. Instead, someone else happened to be intending to blast this Nalaq into smithereens.</p>\n<p>“Thank God! Thank God! If he is a good Nalaq, maybe we don’t need to throw the second ngajen ceremony for this month, after all!” Patriarch Shuro Yashura exclaimed. The elders in the guest hall followed his exclaiming by handclapping and joyful cries. Ngajen ceremony only held once a month so the village safe from angry Selaqs, no one ever tried it to protect themselves from intelligent Nalaqs. Since the village was founded, the locals never had a Nalaq dwelling there. So it was natural for the elders to worry about throwing a ceremony they didn’t know working or not. Ngajen ceremony was expensive, after all.</p>\n<p>The more Shira saw how the previous tense hall turned jubilant and full of relieved faces, the more awkward he became. That Nalaq might call himself ‘Good-Natured Spirit’, yet he was anything but good. A low-life spirit who no doubt had been using the invisibility traits of spirits to commit many deprived crimes. He was closer to evil spirit incarnation than a good-natured one. The misunderstanding was too great his face twisted as if he’d just taste a sour lemon.</p>\n<p>Sir Baront Staterwind said, “Still, since he seems reluctant to use his old name, I reckon the Nalaq that approaching you is a low-tier one, Young Master Shira. Low-tier Nalaqs usually spirits that gain consciousness merely by luck. They don’t have factions backing them, and fortunately--in my experience--it easier to initiate negotiation with unaffiliated Nalaqs.” A hint of pride then flashed through his eyes, he continued, “my disciples will arrive tomorrow morning. One of them contracted with a high-tier Nalaq. Since the Nalaq’s mood turned sour is partly my fault, with help from the Nalaq contracted with one of my disciples, I will ask him to leave Yashura Family peacefully!”</p>\n<p>“Sir Staterwind is wise! Thank you for your concern, Sir!” Patriarch Shuro sang praises toward this expert. The elders of Yashura Family followed suit.</p>\n<p>“As expected of such expert!”</p>\n<p>“Sir Staterwind is the best of bunch of all experts that I know all my life!”</p>\n<p>“Hurray for Sir Staterwind!”</p>\n<p>They circling Sir Baront Staterwind and, not long after that, someone started to prostate. They behaved as if the guest was their one and only savior. Even Shira was getting embarrassed from seeing the scene, not to mention the already flushing Baront Staterwind.</p>\n<p>When everyone getting carried away, Shira slipped out after excusing himself. He knew he was no match for the Yashura Family’s older generations’ shamelessness. Upon walking outside, he saw Yulong was standing by the hall’s door looking galant as usual with his butler professionalism.</p>\n<p>“Can you please try to stop my uncle, Yulong? Sir Staterwind is started to get uncomfortable there.”</p>\n<p>Yulong glanced at the whole mess inside, and then he said to his young master, “I think it’s not everyday an expert coming to Yashura Family, young master, so let’s count this as Patriarch Yashura to gaining favors from a foreign expert.”</p>\n<p>“Are they really okay, though?”</p>\n<p>Yulong smiled.</p>\n<p>“Of course they aren’t, young master. But Patriarch Shuro and the family elders are honest people. Although sometimes they can be overwhelming, I’m sure Sir Staterwind can see no falsehood in their words.”</p>\n<p>Shira looked at those elders inside once again. The more he saw, the more he realized that those hysterical village men calling a man they barely knew these past two days a savior by no means a lie from their part. The elders really were freaking out when they heard the explosion. And Patriarch Shuro Yashura was the most worried of the bunch, considering him a patriarch and an uncle. Thinking about it all again, Shira couldn’t really say he still embarrassed seeing the elders spewing exaggerated flattering with straight faces.</p>\n<p>“Sir Staterwind comes from a respectable sect. Someone like that won’t get to travel the southern lands if he didn’t know the nature of the local people. So it best not to worry about it too much, young master,” Yulong said.</p>\n<p>“Really… ah, speaking of sects,” Shira deliberately changed the topic, “I heard from someone that one of the major families in Badril Village hosts members of a certain sect in secret. You’re from outside, Yulong--do you think something so outrageous like that could happen?”</p>\n<p>“Some older sects have long reaching influence, but I don’t think anyone would be interested to plant their own in Badril Village. There’s nothing valuable here for them to take notice.”</p>\n<p>“As I thought. It’s just unthinkable to think some secret powers lurking beneath our everyday lives. What if some experts actually pretending to be servants here in Yashura Family?”</p>\n<p>Although it wasn’t noticeable, Yulong’s smile became stiff.</p>\n<p>“You jest, young master. If that was true, do you think your uncle and the elders can take that kind of truth?”</p>\n<p>Following Yulong’s gaze, Shira peeped the hall and saw Sir Baront’s awkward figure, where he was in the center of Yashura Family elites--all of them-- who passionately prostrating in the floor. They practically worshipping him now.</p>\n<p>“You’re right…” Shira could only hide his face with his palm. Just when he thought he could understand them, the boy then wished he didn’t know these shameless men.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>As far as the current generation of Badril Village locals knew, they never got visited by nobles until this month Malikh Family’s ngajen ceremony happened. Everyone still talking about it.</p>\n<p>Young Master of Blackwood Family only stayed in Badril Village in one day. And the noble carriage of Blackwood Family set off out of Badril Village by noon. The next morning after the day he was gone, the two foreign guests who had been staying in Malikh Family, Mister Harrington and Madame Sylvia, felt overstaying might be unnecessary, thus decided to leave too.</p>\n<p>Because the carriages going out from Badril Village mostly for public transports, Bhela personally asked an elder from his father’s faction who had a horse carriage to give her guests a ride to the nearest town, where they’d later book a private carriage for them to return home. Mister Harrington, as an unsocial bachelor as he always was, was waiting in the carriage for Madame Sylvia to say her parting words to Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>“You have a very bright future, Young Lady Bhela. A girl with limitless potential. So your favor will become very valuable as you mature,” Madame Sylvia said. “If you need something, you can always send letters to my sect. Don’t hold back. Just think about this of us making an investment.”</p>\n<p>Since Bhela a smart girl anyway, Madame Sylvia decided not to make her words fancy and told her in a straightforward manner. Bhela appreciated her honesty, and said her thanks.</p>\n<p>The carriage then set off. In the main gate of Badril Village, the guards on duty witnessed the recently blazing popular Young Lady Bhela Malikh bowing her body as she sent off two foreigners in traveling clothes made from expensive linen.</p>\n<p>“Look at how she is,” inside the carriage, Madame Sylvia said to Mister Harrington. “She’s a pretty sensible girl, don’t you think?”</p>\n<p>“She is,” Mister Harrington said softly, almost a murmur.</p>\n<p>It was hard to start a conversation whenever Mister Harrington sat with his arms crossed tightly. Madame Sylvia could see that he wasn’t exactly happy with the outcome regarding Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>There was no bandits lurking around, and no monsters occasionally came out, proved that the lands around Badril Village actually well-protected--too well, perhaps, for a rural village without a major power backing them. Their journey was smooth without disturbance. Thirty minutes after they left Badril Village, they encountered another carriage painted with black-jet color. The black carriage was well-decorated with golden-colored plates, obviously elites or nobles were traveling inside.</p>\n<p>However, unlike common nobles who liked to hide in the carriage to show-off their elegance and aloofness, this carriage simply out of commonsense. To talk about how weird this carriage was there was a need to point out the refreshing greenness of the view around. Despite there being a road far away from settlement, hint of liveliness from bird chirping--along with croaking frogs from nearby streams and singing insects--completed the idyllic road with a strange harmony that invited light-hearted person to sing along with lively nature. That was exactly what the noble in the black carriage doing. A young lady with a very girly and childish feature was carefreely sitting in the window in spite of pale servants begging her to sit still. She completely dumb about the servants’ pleas. And with her personality, nobody knew whether she was pretending or not. The only thing that the jubilant Lyla Blackwood cared about was singing an off-tune song about her befriending village frogs and bunnies.</p>\n<p>“Prepare your life you frogs and bunnies~</p>\n<p>Cause I’m not letting you go before we become the best of buddies~~</p>\n<p>Wait for me you birdies and kitties~~</p>\n<p>Cause we’re about to become the best of all buddies~~ yuhuu~ yuhuu~~</p>\n<p>The best buddies in this lifetime~~ yuhuuuu~~~”</p>\n<p>There was nothing the servants and the guards could do to stop their young lady from singing this amazingly ugly song about her future exploits in Badril Village. Seeing that another carriage approaching, the horse-riding guards did their best to block the view to the crest planted on the carriage’s compartment. Their effort to save faces from the young lady’s mishap was futile, however, since the other party happened to know Lyla.</p>\n<p>“How many times have I told you to stay away from windows, Lyla!”</p>\n<p>“Whu--what? Who?” Lyla was surprised. But then she was elated to see a familiar face. “Is that you, Instructor Sylvia? You here to train Sis Bhela’s archery again?”</p>\n<p>“Get down from the window!” Madame Sylvia raised her voice.</p>\n<p>“I’m also here to meet Sis Bhela!” Lyla also raised her voice cheerfully.</p>\n<p>“Lyla, you won’t be able to get married in the future if you’re always act like this!” Madame Sylvia warned her. She long dropped title of Young Lady Blackwood when talking to this naughty girl.</p>\n<p>“Um!” Lyla nodded. “But which one do you like more, Instructor Sylvia, bunnies or kitties?” It was no use trying to talk sense to Lyla. Any warning only come to her right ear and gone out straight from the left one.</p>\n<p>“Stay away from the windows!!!” Madame Sylvia screamed until her voice shrilled.</p>\n<p>Lyla also screamed, “Good morning to you too!!!”</p>\n<p>Both carriages drifted apart after the brief encounter. It ended with Lyla happily waved her hands happily. Madame Sylvia sighed and shook her head. That girl was so naughty that the troubles she created made the seminars’ managements even considered to drop her once during the seminars. Only after Bhela Malikh convinced them she’d take care of Lyla they finally did let go the matter.</p>\n<p>Before, the black carriage of Blackwood Family came to Badril Village in the shroud of night’s darkness, so nobody noticed their elegance and the aura of expensive carriage blazing through the village road--of which was surprisingly wide for a settlement road, unlike road of cities in the western kingdoms, because long ago Mossack people needed to endure monster stampedes passing through their villages once every few months.</p>\n<p>“Mom, look, is that a noble?” a snotty kid pointing out the carriage.</p>\n<p>The mother hurriedly pulled her child. “Ssuuussh! Keep your finger to yourself! Don’t you know what happened to peasants that make noble angry from the stories they always talking about?”</p>\n<p>The steel-armored guards who escort the carriage scoffed them in disdain. Contrast with the escorts’ attitudes, Lyla waved her hand at them, while shouting, “Hey boy, don’t you think bunnies are cute as the kitties? Or do you like cats more?”</p>\n<p>The kid didn’t answer. He instead forced to bow by her mother and let the carriage went through silently. The villagers didn’t have the experience in receiving nobles, most of them--except for those who attended the ngajen ceremony in Malikh Family--had never saw nobles in their lives. Because of that they were awkward and didn’t know what to do.</p>\n<p>Lyla didn’t seem to mind their stiffness. Instead, she vigorously greeted everyone she saw from the window she sat on.</p>\n<p>“Good day! Good morning! I’m here to sleepover at Sis Bhela’s place! Do you know where Sis Bhela lives?”</p>\n<p>Back in Elzhier Family, in the main family’s house, their patriarch, hurriedly changed his clothes to a formal one he always used every ngajen ceremony.</p>\n<p>“Hurry, hurry! As the head of this village, how can I let a noble arriving without me receiving them?!”</p>\n<p>Not even he yet buttoned his shirt properly, the Village Head sprinted toward the main street, only to see the crowd of onlookers already dispersed and still talking about the scary nobles they always heard in stories were actually <em>weirdly</em> friendly.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Bhela Malikh was already notified about Lyla Blackwood’s arrival. She waited on a chair at the Malikh Family’s gate, drinking a fresh young coconut water occasionally. The black carriage finally was in her view. And the young girl she was waiting for happily waved her hand at her. From the window.</p>\n<p>“Carefull, Lyla!” Bhela yelled as she sprang from her chair.</p>\n<p>“Huuupp!” Lyla Blackwood simply didn’t want to waste anytime leaving the carriage through the door. So she simply jumped from the window she sat upon, before the carriage even stopped. It was fortunate that amongst Bhela’s skill as a Unique Class, she had <b>Haste</b>, which boosted her speed in short duration. She used that to catch Lyla before she hurt herself. The young noble girl landed splendidly in Bhela’s arm.</p>\n<p>“What’s this, Sistah?” Lyla’s eyes sparkled when she saw Bhela get a young coconut in her other hand. She was completely oblivious she just did something dangerous.</p>\n<p>“Young coconut. There’s still some of its water left. Here, try this,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“For me? Really?”</p>\n<p>“Drink slowly…”</p>\n<p><em>Glug glug glug</em>. Lyla drank the coconut in anything but in slowly manner. She even burped shamelessly.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Lyla, ah!” the butler who coming with her was in horror seeing how Young Lady Lyla Blackwood made a horrible mess by spilling the coconut water on her expensive, silk woven black dress. Only an equally expensive silk handkerchief worthy enough to wipe his young lady’s noble dress!</p>\n<p>“I told you to drink slowly…” Bhela said. She used her sleeve to wipe Lyla’s wet face, and then proceeded to also wipe Lyla’s dress.</p>\n<p>“Y-young miss!” the butler shouted in panic. His body jolted as soon as he saw the outrageous act of spoiling the young noble’s dress by making it contacted with commoner clothes. That was heresy! He needed her to stop before she contained Blackwood’s expensive dress with her commoner’s bacteria!</p>\n<p>“You need something?” Bhela looked at this unfamiliar butler of Blackwood Family. Her expressionless face judged the butler coldly.</p>\n<p>“My name is Tim, young miss--please use this!” the butler offered a silky smooth handkerchief with Blackwood Family’s crest embroidered on the surface. The handkerchief was actually the butler’s, was awarded to his great-great-great grandfather by the then Baron Blackwood for some sort of achievement that practically nobody was still alive to remember. Everytime Butler Tim met a new person, he’d make an excuse to show off this particular handkerchief. Today was no exception. It was his most precious handkerchief. Just from the look of it one could tell how crazy expensive it was.</p>\n<p>“Ah, ah… my nose… aahhh--” Lyla felt her nose was wet and itchy, “--ahhtchii!!!”</p>\n<p>“You’ve got a flu?” Bhela asked worriedly.</p>\n<p>“Yeah. Aunt Jiji told me to drink my medicine everyday but it’s so bitter. So much bitter that it’s evil!”</p>\n<p>“Where’s your medicine now?”</p>\n<p>“Oh. I throw it away last night.”</p>\n<p>Bhela shook her head.</p>\n<p>“That’s no good. You can’t throw away your medicine like that. Now, wipe your nose. This mister butler said to use this…” she put the handkerchief on Lyla’s nose, and Lyla blew her nose on it.</p>\n<p>Lyla gave back the handkerchief to Butler Tim. “Thank you, Sir Butler. It’s very helpful of you.”</p>\n<p>The butler received back his most precious handkerchief. Bonus Lyla’s snot.</p>\n<p>“Come on inside,” Bhela said to Lyla. “Even if the water runs dry, coconuts still have meat we can scoop. After that we’ll pick some star fruits that I planted since I was a child.”</p>\n<p>“Star fruits! Woohooo!”</p>\n<p>The girls then walked inside. Lyla was so excited she didn’t leave her friend, hanging on her neck like a koala being comfortable on a tree branch. The stories about a noble young lady coming to Malikh Family for Bhela Malikh spread amongst the maidservants like oil being poured on an open wildfire. The Malikhs couldn’t describe the pride seeing their eldest young lady with a blue blood friend. Especially the aunties. They watched how close Bhela and Lyla with teary eyes and happy smiles.</p>\n<p>“Young lady is… finally… finally…”</p>\n<p>“She finally has a friend…”</p>\n<p>“Huuu… huuu… merciful Goddesses finally saw the young lady’s plight and blessed her with a real friend… huuu huuuu….”</p>\n<p>Nobody more happier than the aunties who were familiar with how their Young Lady Bhela lived her live. They silently cried watching their young lady, who usually alone and unapproachable, finally grown up and had her first friend in these past ten years.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Butler Tim grimaced inside. Despite the fact that he was tasked to win over Bhela Malikh with any means necessary, he didn’t like this girl. It wasn’t because his handkerchief got dirty--well, maybe he resented her for it a little--it because the girl named Bhela Malikh wasn’t acting as a young country girl supposed to act. Country bumpkins supposed to falter when they saw the radiance seeped out of the nobles’ aura, they supposed to tremble when they saw the noble wealth glittering beneath the sun. But this girl was indifferent and aloof. She was cold but the coldness paired with concise and elegant mannerism. Butler Tim knew she trying to act noble herself. That was why he didn’t like her.</p>\n<p>However, Butler Tim was a smart person. Any smart person would wear a perfect smile despite his heart bleeding over the snot on his precious handkerchief. Before leaving the city, the butler didn’t forget to look for a gift he’d use to lower the Malikh Family’s guard. He heard the previous gift was rejected, and when he asked for the content of the gift, the smart Butler Tim shook his head as if he knew it would happen.</p>\n<p>Toward country bumpkins, too expensive gifts would never work. He knew this because he was smart. And because he was smart, he knew better gifts. Not-so-expensive gifts worked for country bumpkins.</p>\n<p>Therefore, he presented Bhela Malikh with popular city biscuits.</p>\n<p>“I heard this biscuit is currently very popular among noble young ladies. This butler happened to pass by a store that sold this, so I reckon Young Lady Bhela might love to taste some.”</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, because the elders roughly knew the Blackwood Family’s youngest lady would come to visit, two leaders of opposing factions came to watch how their Young Lady Bhela would receive the noble guest. Elder Jhamil was all smiling because he liked what he saw. But the expression of Elder Khasim turned sour when he saw how the butler of Blackwood Family tried to butter up to Bhela Malikh.</p>\n<p>“Don’t accept it, young lady, please….” Elder Khasim whispered under his breath. Of course, there was no single soul heard what he just said. He was worried the hard work to rebuild his faction’s morale all would turn into dust if people thought their spiritual mascot, the one and only Young Lady Bhela Malikh, could be bought with mere biscuits.</p>\n<p>Contrary to what Elder Khasim hoped, Bhela Malikh received the gift without even putting a second thought. A feeling of defeat surged inside him. Elder Jhamil looked at his rival with a mocking glance.</p>\n<p>After receiving the snacks, Bhela excused herself and brought Lyla with her to stroll around Malikh Family’s gardens. Butler Tim pretended to wave his hand and smiled, but inside, he was gloating at how hypocrite Bhela was. His guess that Young Lady Bhela wouldn’t refuse the gift he brought was entirely correct. Before, he deliberately said the biscuit was noble young ladies’ favorite. Thus, according to his smart logic, as long as it wasn’t too expensive that it’d scare this fake young lady, no way a noble wannabe would reject this kind of gifts.</p>\n<p>“Heh,” Butler Tim scoffed when Bhela and Lyla already left. “Bet you’ve never eaten any city biscuits your entire life, haven’t you.”</p>\n<p>Indeed, Bhela Malikh hadn’t had any city biscuits her entire life. Not before and also not today. What Butler Tim didn’t know was that the snacks he bought with his own money ultimately ended up returned to Blackwood Family--to be exact, it ended up inside Lyla Blackwood’s belly. Bhela couldn’t help but received the biscuits when, beside her, she saw Lyla was drooling looking at the biscuits.</p>\n<p>The elders led by Elder Jhamil then respectfully welcomed the butler along with servants and guards from Blackwood Family. From the impression alone, Butler Tim could see reasons for him to like this slick-tongued Elder Jhamil. He knew how to flatter and also he knew how to act humble in front of people with higher status than him. Not like that noble-wannabe Young Lady of Malikh Family. This Elder Jhamil knew that he was only a country bumpkin thus acted accordingly. Naturally, the smart Butler Tim was pleased.</p>\n<p>And so began Butler Tim’s quests to swallow Malikh Family with his smartly planned schemes and cunning political games.</p>\n<p>In mere hours, the neutral elders who hadn’t joined either both rivalling factions began flocking to Elder Jhamil’s side. One part because they wanted to side with the faction that had the noble support and another part simply because Elder Jhamil, with the help of Butler Tim, had been throwing around sweet deals over all directions.</p>\n<p>“Only one tenth of the elder council members don’t want to pick a side by now, but their number is too significant to be an obstacle for Sir Butler’s great plan,” Elder Jhamil reported the current situation to Butler Tim.</p>\n<p>The butler was enjoying a glass of tea served by the maid that supposed to serve Young Lady Lyla Blackwood as if he was the visiting noble himself. He nodded. “I see. With this, the first stage of my plan has been completed.”</p>\n<p>“Oohhh!” Elder Jhamil exclaimed. “Sir Butler summoned rain and fire by flipping Malikh Family’s political scene upside down, and this is only the first stage?! As expected, the Butler of Blackwood Family is very smart!”</p>\n<p>Butler Tim originally wanted to act aloof and sophisticated before he visited this rural village. However, upon being called a smart person, he couldn’t help but grinned widely. “Oho, you’re an interesting fella, aren’t you? Very well, since you’ve done a good job yourself, I won’t be so petty to grab all the credit. Tell me how I should do next, if I like what I hear, we might as well corporate your thoughts into my plan.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was excited. How could he not? An opportunity to rise beyond a mere elder of rural village was laid before him.</p>\n<p>“Sir Butler, you may not know this, but we Mossack people regard having a good meal very highly. Everytime we’re having breakfast or dinner together as the entire family, even though we’re always looked peaceful outside, those trivial events actually are a political battlefield for us elders to extend our influence! This lowly man himself used a few move in the past during breakfast to gather like-minded men under my banner. I used all my resources and connections in a single mealtime to attack my rivals! However, these past two days, my biggest rival used a lowly method against me…”</p>\n<p>“Oh? What did he do?” Butler Tim asked.</p>\n<p>“He didn’t do much,” Elder Jhamil said, sneering when he was talking about this rival of his, “all he did was inviting Young Lady Bhela everytime we were having a meal in the family hall. He’s been a stubborn and ignorant supporter of main family, but this time he actually knew how to use his connection with the main family to deal a blow against me. A few of the elders had been faltering when they saw Young Lady Bhela leaning over the other side; I’m afraid if we’re leaving this ignorant rival of me doing as he wanted, there’s gonna be a hole in Sir Butler’s smart plan!”</p>\n<p>Butler Tim swirled the tea in his cup as though he was deep in thought. Of course, if this proven to endanger his smart plan, the butler couldn’t sit still watching all that happened. “I heard the Mossacks are peculiar people, but I don’t know you Mossack people have a strange custom!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, yes, we’re living here far away from the city, so of course our traditions might seem unsophisticated to wise westerners like Sir Butler,” Elder Jhamil fawned.</p>\n<p>“Then what do you suggest Blackwood Family should do in this situation, Elder Jhamil?”</p>\n<p>“It’s easy!” Elder Jhamil was so excited he almost jumped from his seat. “My rival faction used Young Lady Bhela to gain foothold, and we can also use that to deal a greater blow back to them!”</p>\n<p>“And that is?”</p>\n<p>“Of course, we can use--I mean, we can invite young noble miss to a dinner together with us. With this we can unofficially announce our alliance with Blackwood Family! It’s the final nail to main family’s faction!”</p>\n<p>Even though Bhela Malikh’s status as a Unique Class shone throughout all of Badril Village, her name still fall short with a pure noble like Lyla Blackwood. Madam back in Blackwood Family used her daughter so Blackwood could infiltrate Malikh Family easily, but that didn’t mean Lyla still wasn’t as useful.</p>\n<p>“Very well. Let us go with that,” then he asked the maid responsible for Lyla’s schedule. “What was Young Lady Lyla doing this afternoon?”</p>\n<p>The maid replied, “Young Lady Bhela Malikh carried her around to play. At first, they went to Malikh Family’s orchard to pick some fruits. Then they visited the sick Patriarch Malikh in his room for a few minutes. After that, they went outside to stroll and came back with a new rabbit pet they bought from other family. Finally, when the sun is setting, they went to the kitchen to watch the servants cooking.”</p>\n<p>“How uncouth for a noble young lady being led around in dirty places like that,” Butler Tim was displeased, but nothing he could do since making Bhela’s attention elsewhere meant he could move freely to make a trap for her. Nodding to himself, the butler then gave an instruction to the maid, “you go to Young Lady Lyla and tell that Malikh Family invite her for a dinner.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil was excitedly rubbing his hands when Butler Tim said that. Finally, payback to those imbecile Elder Khasim!</p>\n<p>“But, Butler Tim…” the maid hesitated.</p>\n<p>“What is it?”</p>\n<p>“Malikh Family already invited Young Lady Lyla to have dinner. She’s eating in Malikh Family’s hall right now….”</p>\n<p>“Hmm, what do you mean?”</p>\n<p>What the maid meant was that someone in Malikh Family already brought Lyla to have dinner with them.</p>\n<p>When Butler Tim playing political games and scheming around in Malikh Family, Bhela Malikh, along with the elders friendly with Elder Khasim, had been giving bunch of candies and food for Lyla Blackwood, much more than the biscuits Butler Tim brought with him. Being a great foodie herself, Lyla never had enough, the first day in Malikh Family she ate more sweets and foods worth of one week back in Blackwood Family’s manor. Aunt Jiji and other Blackwood Family’s maid servants would freak out if they saw how glutton Lyla currently was.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the news that the main family’s faction hosting a dinner for a noble miss swept Malikh Family like a thunderstorm. The neutral elders Elder Jhamil had just bought flocking back toward Elder Khasim’s side. It was so sudden. Everyone wasn’t even got a breath to process what had happened. And this for sure was an unprecedented move ever since Patriarch Ghalim suddenly fell ill and retreated from the political scene.</p>\n<p>Just as one side was busy completing the first stage to win over the Young Lady of Malikh Family, the other side already won over Young Lady of the noble Blackwood Family. All happened in a span of a single day.</p>\n<p>“Y-young Lady Lyla…”</p>\n<p>Even Butler Tim couldn’t pull his own young miss seeing how happy she was. His plan had been jabbed in a completely unexpected way. Maybe he wasn’t so smart after all.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>It was unfortunate that Madam Malikh didn’t see the Young Noble Miss of Blackwood Family kindly. Even though the girl did nothing wrong, Madam Malikh wasn’t so muddled that she wasn’t aware what Blackwood Family and those corrupt elders conspiring against her husband and Malikh’s main family. Even Bhela herself couldn’t do anything to change her mother’s mind.</p>\n<p>However, Lyla Blackwood, an airhead as she always was, was oblivious of the hostility directed toward her.</p>\n<p>It was morning the second day Lyla in Badril Village. Following her friend Bhela, she carried a little box inside Patriarch Ghalim’s bedroom. This little box filled with custom-made medicines--most were amateurly mixed from two different trivial medicines, consisted of remedies for flu and headache. Nothing harmful but nothing useful at the same time. And just like yesterday, to pay for Bhela parents’ kindness for letting her staying in Malikh Family, Lyla Blackwood decided to play doctor a little bit.</p>\n<p>“Uncle, I’m coming again to help you feel better,” Lyla said as she dragged a chair and sat beside Patriarch Ghalim’s sick bed. Seeing the pale middle-aged man in bed, she blinked her googly eyes, then continued, “how’s yesterday medicine I gave you. Are you feeling a tiny minny bit better, perhaps?”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim certainly was feeling better these past few days, not because Lyla’s medicines, but Grandpa Piss’s diagnosis and remedies. Toward this girl, he weakly nodded. “Thank you for your help, little lady.”</p>\n<p>“Then I’m going to fed you my newest recipe, uncle. Here, here, open your mouth.”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghamil did what he was told. Because Lyla didn’t like bitter medicine, she added lots of brown sugar. Lots and lots of brown sugar.</p>\n<p>“It’s… sweet.”</p>\n<p>“Are you feeling better, now?” Lyla asked.</p>\n<p>“Yes, little lady, I’m feeling better.”</p>\n<p>As a matter of fact, he wasn’t. The medicine was more like a candy than remedy.</p>\n<p>“Good! If you eat this three times a day, maybe your illness would go away, uncle,” Lyla then sternly pointed out, “maybe!”</p>\n<p>Madam Malikh was nervous when her husband consumed the strange medicine Lyla gave him, but she didn’t open her mouth to protest. Bhela was changing the pillows’ sheet nearby, and doing some other chores that usually were done by the servants. In the meantime, Lyla was giving advice for Patriarch Ghalim liked how he should eat moderately three times a day, how he should brush his teeth after he ate sweets, and all the things Aunt Jiji told Lyla all the time.</p>\n<p>“I’m going to visit again, uncle, get well soon!” Lyla waved her hands. Carrying a broom in her hands, Lyla’s next schedule was following Bhela doing chores in the courtyard.</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim weakly waved his hand back. Of course, after the girls were already gone, he noticed his bitter wife biting her lips indignantly.</p>\n<p>“Don’t stare the girl so much. She’s not responsible for her family’s wrongdoings. It’s not like a girl her age knows what her parents do behind the scene.”</p>\n<p>“Why did you eat that? What if they used her to give you more poison?”</p>\n<p>“Bhela wouldn’t let me have the medicine if she didn’t what it was, no? Stop putting that kind of face, you only make our daughter feels awkward about all this.”</p>\n<p>The woman held her husband’s hand, kissing it with her forehead as she hid her face. She whispered, “Oh, don’t you know how hurt this heart holding back my grievance? Why did our daughter had to bring someone from that family inside our roof?” she sniffed, “how long this farce gonna last? What should I do in the mean time? Oh! I don’t know! I don’t know!”</p>\n<p>Patriarch Ghalim sighed as he witnessed his wife cried helplessly.</p>\n<p>In the courtyard, near the coops where Malikh Family raised chickens and ducks, Lyla was squatting in front of the new bunny she and Bhela bought just yesterday. She was waiting the whole morning just to feed this bunny. The bunny hopped around, itching to play in spite it couldn’t resist the temptation of delicious green leaves, again and again. Wathing how glutton the bunny was, Lyla found herself immerse in immense joy. She very much envying the life of a bunny. Perhaps that because she could relate to how it spent its day without worry; eating, playing, sleeping, then playing again--a life that she longed to have. If only she was born a rabbit instead of a young lady of noble family….</p>\n<p>The sound of the broom swept the ground took away her attention. Lyla couldn’t understand how a daughter of a patriarch like Bhela had to work so much.</p>\n<p>“Why do you work so much, Sistah?” Lyla asked when she found out there still much dry leaves Bhela had to sweep. “Won’t you get bored soon? Just let the servants clean this place.”</p>\n<p>Bhela, sweeping as if Lyla’s idleness didn’t bother her the slightest, replied, “Here in Badril Village, everyone who hasn’t done their coming of age ceremony has to do chores for their parents. It doesn’t matter if it’s the farmer’s daughter or the biggest family’s young lady, helping the matter of the household is one of the seven virtues we Mossack people get to do for our parents.”</p>\n<p>Originally, Lyla wanted her friend also playing with the bunny. But hearing Bhela just said something serious, there was no way she’d reveal her intention now. “My mom always nagging me to go to dance lesson or whatever. It’s very very boring,” she murmured, a bit dejected.</p>\n<p>“The west and the south have different values,” Bhela said. “Complete your virtue for your parents then you’ll grow to be a fine lady, Lyla.”</p>\n<p>“Uggghhh…” Lyla grunted as she didn’t want to continue the topic any further. She long developed a sense for her own survival to detect whether or not the conversation ended up she being forced to do some boring stuff. Knowing Bhela’s personality, Lyla knew soon Sis Bhela’d make her doing chores too. Grabbing the bunny, Lyla quickly escaped somewhere else so that she could spend her time playing. Bhela shook her head seeing the girl’s behavior.</p>\n<p>Bhela then noticed some servants whispering while they looking at Lyla from the distance. Many people were curious what a noble young lady like her would do in a rural place like this, and Bhela wasn’t that oblivious not to notice the eyes planted by the elders of Malikh Family.</p>\n<p>Not long after that, she then saw four girls dressed in expensive garments approaching Lyla with their mouth covered with feathered fans in their hands. Their clothing looked as if they attending some sort of ceremony, while in fact, they calculated that this kind of appearance was the most suitable for them to socialize with a girl of blue-blooded origin. Bhela recognized the leader of those girls was actually Elder Jhamil’s niece.</p>\n<p>“Have you read Le Armour dan Varoza written by Leornador De Gonzalez, Young Lady Blackwood?”</p>\n<p>“Ah, yes, that piece was adequately sophisticated but I think Vista van Gracious’s omnibus more than adequate, le banjour?”</p>\n<p>“I see, I see, their pieces adequately well-written as those senor themselves adequattely live as maestro. But perhaps equoliette more than fit the diagram as paradigm sensorita abligioate senor des adequately le banjour.”</p>\n<p>“But of course, Young Lady Blackwood is more addequately sophisitacted as it’s a noblesse obligiote to be more sohpisitacated than us village senioritas. Perhaps le banjour is fortuna with de gracious by Young Lady’s great wisdom?”</p>\n<p>Lyla blinked her eyes trying to decipher whatever these girls mean. The bunny in her arms even escaped amidst her confusion.</p>\n<p>“Uhh… uhhh…” Lyla timidly stepped back from the feathered fan girls. “I think Sis Bhela is calling me…”</p>\n<p>She swiftly ran away back to her friend Bhela.</p>\n<p>“Sistah, Sistah Bhela!” Lyla cried and grabbing Bhela’s sloven sleeve tightly, demanding for justice, “they came to bully me!”</p>\n<p>“What did they do?” Bhela asked.</p>\n<p>“They know I can’t speak western language! They came to test me! They’re even worse than those rich girls in seminar--they jumble some western mumbo jumbo into plain language in order to confuse me! They must be laughing and call me stupid by now!”</p>\n<p>Hearing Lyla’s grievance, Bhela patted her head in order to let the girl calmed down.</p>\n<p>“Lyla, those girls are different than the noble girls that always making fun of you.”</p>\n<p>“Different? How so?”</p>\n<p>Bhela looked at the girls who also was watching them back while fanning themselves with their fabulous feathered fans.</p>\n<p>“They looked like noble descendants, but actually were not.”</p>\n<p>“I still don’t like them nonetheless!”</p>\n<p>“You don’t have to talk to them if you don’t want to,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>Yet Lyla still restlessly tugging Bhela’s sleeves, making it harder for her to do her chores. Before the peers that always making fun of her, Lyla was always helpless and had been depending on Bhela’s figure as a shield. What it looked like from the point of view of an outsider was a scene where a young mother being tested of her patience dealing with a girl who was throwing a tantrum.</p>\n<p>Seeing that the young noble miss wouldn’t come back soon, the feathered fan girls approaching Bhela and Lyla instead.</p>\n<p>“Oh, fancy to meet Young Lady Bhela here, le banjour!”</p>\n<p>“Le bonjour…” Bhela hesitated to reply back. Tilting her head slightly, she studied the pompously dressed girls before her. These girls were relatives of Malikh Family’s elders. None of them could match with Bhela if talking strictly about social status wise, not to mention talents. However, while she was holding her broom, it looked like Bhela was the one with common origin, while these girls were floating swans who happened to be generous enough to greet plebeians with their <em>unique</em> vocabulary.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Lyla Blackwood hid behind Lyla’s back. Despite a noble origin herself, meeting more cocky and fake young ladies than the girls before her were rare experience for Lyla.</p>\n<p>“Young Lady Bhela, fancy to meet you. Good morning. The weather is nice. I eat snails everyday,” Elder Jhamil’s niece took the lead and said that with a hint of inflated pride.</p>\n<p>Bhela narrowed her eyes. She could see why Lyla instantly hated these girls. She then said in a sleek foreign language, “Je ne sais pas de quoi tu parles. Si vous ne parlez pas une langue étrangère, fermez simplement la bouche, sinon vous faites peur aux enfants avec votre non-sens.”</p>\n<p>The feathered fan girls blinked their eyes trying to decipher whatever Bhela had said.</p>\n<p>“Oh, it turns out Young Lady Bhela is aquadettely know some le banjour!”</p>\n<p>“Yes, Young Lady Bhela is adequately sophisticated after all. Me gusta!”</p>\n<p>“I see, I see, le pasta fortuna is delicosaza.”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s niece didn’t say anything as she only maintained a sweet smile while being nervous herself. Racking her brains over remembering the contents of thick dictionary, she tried to form a decent sentences in foreign language. But Bhela then cut off her train of thought before she could say a word.</p>\n<p>“Blackwood Family is migrating noble that has long been making their roots here in southern land. Hundred of years living far away from their western peers, noble families like this would naturally become more lax. It’s natural for Lyla to not mastering her homeland’s native tongue.”</p>\n<p>Bhela said that in a straight manner. That was a white lie, however. It was true that many noble families coming from the western side of Tiramikal Continent to forgot their western root and began to see themselves as southerners. But those were usually the case depending right circumstances, like exiled nobles, or some young masters who had lost in political battle branched out and fancied themselves a legit noble family with themselves at the helm. Blackwood Family weren’t exiled nobles, and though Lyla’s ancestors branching out some hundreds of years ago, that didn’t automatically made them cutting off ties with the original family. The main family of Blackwood was back in a western country called Tatalghia Kingdom, still sending letters and envoys from time to time to the branch Lyla was living in--although, undeniably, the southern branch of Blackwood Family had long developed and surpassed the main one.</p>\n<p>It seemed like Bhela already used to tell this lie. Anyone who heard this would be forced to accept it, unless they wanted to spend time and resources digging through the details--which to be honest, none of these pompous young girls were willing or simply unable to go through.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Elder Jhamil’s niece believed Lyla’s family exempt her to excel in foreign language. Yet she was still displeased inside. Her uncle told her that Bhela had been hogging the young noble’s influence for herself, everyone in Malikh Family already knew how Bhela Malikh carrying around the noble young lady yesterday. So what if she had some more bit of talent and had been running around overseas in that whatever seminars she was attending? A bumpkin origin wouldn’t be able to change their bumpkin bloodline. So if Bhela had the right to get close with the Young Lady of Blackwood Family, that meant someone coming from the same family should have the same change as her!</p>\n<p>The elder’s niece said, “Young Lady Bhela, I know the main family is prideful. But Young Lady Blackwood is here to experience the village slow life. Don’t you think she also needs to mingle with us commoners?”</p>\n<p>“Lyla will befriend any person she fancies herself, I don’t control with whom she wants to socialize with,” Bhela said.</p>\n<p>“If that’s the case, then why she still has no friends other than you?”</p>\n<p>“That’s not true!” Lyla cried indignantly, “I’ve made friends! With aunties! Aunties in the kitchen!”</p>\n<p>It was easy to be friendly with Lyla. She was always unconventional and never saw people by the social system. To her, people only divided by two types, those who gave her food and those who didn’t. She was like a cat. Just bring a good food and she’d be very friendly the next moment.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Lyla’s frank open-mindedness wasn’t easily accepted by some people. Elder Jhamil’s niece gasped as she looked at Lyla and Bhela, back and forth. “My goodness! Young Lady Bhela, were you letting a noble young lady such as Young Lady Blackwood mingle with dirty servants?!”</p>\n<p>“Why wouldn’t I?” Bhela asked back.</p>\n<p>“You--don’t young lady care about our family’s reputation? What if people said we’ve mistreated a noble young lady?”</p>\n<p>“Lyla is here to experience village slow life,” Bhela said slowly, “don’t you think she also needs to mingle with commoners?”</p>\n<p>Elder Jhamil’s niece was speechless as Bhela used her own words. The contorted expression on her chaky make-up face brought satisfaction for Lyla, who then snorted.</p>\n<p>“What now? Kitty got your tongue?” Lyla said with her mouth pouted. “So that you know, Sis Bhela already made speechless many many bullies like you! Who were many many many times smarter than you! This is what you get by making fun of me--shame on you, hmph! Who’s the stupid one, now?”</p>\n<p>Even after losing a round of squabble against Young Lady Bhela, unexpectedly the nobly young lady herself became hostile against her. All was so sudden that it made blood drained from her face.</p>\n<p>Bhela ruffled Lyla’s hair. Apparently Lyla still believed these girls came to bully her. When Lyla already made up her mind to not liking someone, it was hard to bend on her opinion.</p>\n<p>“Let’s go, Lyla. We’ll help aunties make sweets for afternoon lunch,” Bhela said. Back in the seminars, when Bhela asked Lyla to do some chores, the supposed noble young lady of Blackwood Family would move slowly, occasionally pouting and murmuring some complaints, unwilling to exert her calories on some boring stuff. However, it was different if the destination was kitchen. The spirit of lively bunny would come to possess her--she’d jolt, sprinting, unwilling to waste time as the promise of free sweets and delicious salty snacks was revealed before her.</p>\n<p>“What was that about?!” one of the le bonjour girls scowled after Bhela and Lyla was gone. “How could a young lady speaks like that?”</p>\n<p>“Bhela must lead her around to act like that! Did you hear what she said? The noble young lady thinks we bully her or something.”</p>\n<p>“Aahhh! What a manipulative bitch! I really want to know what that little cunt said to make Young Lady Blackwood think we had made fun of her. No way in hell someone would dare making fun of a noble like her!”</p>\n<p>Actually, Lyla was made fun of so many times. Especially during her study in the seminars abroad. She made fun of so much that she formed a survival instinct to hide behind Bhela’s back. But they didn’t know that. They just assumed as a young lady coming from a noble family, Lyla Blackwood would be adequately pure noble in stories and gossip. The main reason Bhela brought Lyla away was so that Lyla didn’t have to mingle with these delusional le bonjour girls.</p>\n<hr>\n"}
