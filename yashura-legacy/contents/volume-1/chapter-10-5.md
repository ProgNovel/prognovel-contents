title: The Cursed Young Lady of Blackwood Family

---

_From the tender age of six, the Young Lady of Blackwood Family had lived alongside a deadly pandemic._

_For she is cursed._

_And to serve beside her means Blackwood Family has abandoned you._

***

There was a particular maidservant in Blackwood Family named Jane who had just returned because the marriage she almost had was canceled due to her fiancé’s adultery. Upon reporting back to the head maid for her old post, she was told that there was a new girl who already filled it--and for her to continue to work in Blackwood Family, there was no other way except for coming to work as the Blackwood Family’s young lady’s private attendant.

Being an attendant of someone from the main bloodline from a mere common maidservant was a promotion--normally. It was different when it came to the Young Lady of Blackwood Family. Just when Jane thought she had just received bad luck due to her unfaithful partner, another worse luck hit her hard.

“Head maid! Please, anything but there!” she promptly cling on the head maid’s legs. “Don’t send me to Young Lady’s place, please so something for me to get my old post back, we’re sisters for years, head maid! Please, do me a favor--just this once!”

“Jane, don’t be foolish, the new girl is Butler Tim’s niece. They’ve been waiting for a post to be empty to slip her in the past two months. Do you think I could get it back that easily?”

“H-head maid…” Jane knew, although Butler Tim didn’t have enough influence to be a tyrant in Blackwood Family’s manor, still not someone Jane could afford to offend. Biting her bottom lip, she whispered, “Please, head maid… if I perished due to bad luck, how could my family pay their debts?”

“Get up now. Didn’t you say you have a way to pay it without working here for a dozen years more?”

“That was before,” Jane’s voice was hoarse, “I never would’ve thought that bastard only spout empty promises of taking care of my family and other bullshit. Maybe it’s my lucky star that the bastard didn’t manage to make me pregnant after all this time!”

“Now you know better than rely your future on nauseating romance, so I’m going to tell you, Jane--second chances are hard to get, you need to grasp it if one appears in front of you.”

“But wouldn’t it be my last chance I’m to serve Young Lady Blackwood? Everybody’s ended up dead after they were sent to Young Lady’s place!”

“Nonsense. Emeralda and Jenny are still alive and well these past six months there.”

“Their death is only a matter of time!”

Head maid sighed.

“Jane oh Jane, I’m sending you not because I want to see your demise. You’re hardworking girl albeit annoying, how come I want you to die?”

Jane already feeling numb being called names by this woman ten years her senior. Though in her heart she cursed head maid with nicknames like old virgin or such, she still desperate enough for tears falling down her cheeks. “Head maid, what do you mean by that?”

“Don’t you know Sir Arden Blackwood had inquired about young lady’s place a few times recently?” head maid asked her with enigmatic smile.

Jane blinked. She immediately came to head maid as soon as she knew her old post being taken and didn’t have time to gossip with other maidservants. “Really, head maid, you know I just came back. Don’t talk in a roundabout way…”

“Sir Arden is going to hire an expert to clear plague in our Young Lady’s mansion, he’s planning to do it in a month's time,” the head maid said. “You know Sir Arden’s reputation, and you know how reliable his words are. Go serve Young Lady there--by the time Sir Arden comes with the hired expert, he’ll be grateful for loyal servants who willing to accompany his niece in her difficult time!”

Hearing the urge behind head maid’s tone, Jane choked by her own cry from earlier. Even Madam Blackwood had to be polite to this younger brother of hers--as the man’s reputation was the sole reason Madam could be so tyrannical on ruling the house. But even then Sir Arden was too lazy to pay attention to his sister and her be. Jane, a mere maidservant--could she really gain Sir Arden Blackwood’s favor?

The head maid continued, “What are you hesitating for? Even Floria that girl who even prettier than you couldn’t even get Sir Arden to glance at her--do you think any girl can have the same chance as yours right now?” she paused, learning the contour of Jane’s expression before she said again, “even if you can’t be his mistress, Jane, I assure you that even Butler Tim won’t be able to touch your position if Sir Arden Blackwood has a good impression on you.”

Jane lowered her head. Head maid was right. A chance to get on Sir Arden Blackwood’s good side wouldn’t come as easily as this. 

She calculated the weight and found that, since two of her friends were sent to serve Young Lady Blackwood six month ago and still survive, a good odd that Sir Arden Blackwood would rescue her before the disease from Young Lady’s cursed bad luck would take her life for good.

There was no need for her to prepare anything. Her luggage was ready since she didn’t get to visit her old dorm. The head maid even was generous to give Jean a gift money from her own pocket, making Jean feel less regret about how things turned out.

To get into the young lady’s personal mansion, Jane already followed a quiet middle-aged steward with an old carriage pulled by an old mare, which had an appearance that was nothing fancy since the steward’s job all these past two years were only replenishing goods and food supplies. The mansion was originally the noble family’s vacation site, so the distance between the main mansion wasn’t trivial. It required almost the whole day to get there with the quiet steward’s creaky old carriage.

When they about to arrive at the old mansion that hosted the Blackwood Family’s young lady, the quiet steward spoke, “The conditions of your colleagues aren’t good. We still haven’t yet sure of the epidemic’s epicenter, but we know there’s something wrong with nearby plants or water sources from the well in backyard of that mansion, so it’s best if you follow what the senior servant’s words from here forward.”

Jane curled her lips sourly. This steward talked as if he was sincerely giving advice, yet for those in the main manor who didn’t know the rumors about their young lady? The thought spread amongst the servants since for these past three years the young lady was the sole survivor despite many of the servants being wiped out just by staying beside her in a month’s time.

Arriving at the destination welcoming them were a pair of pale-faced maidservants waiting at the gate. Both were somehow familiar. A moment later, Jane was stupefied when she found out that the two white doll-like girls with black eyebags on them were actually Emeralda and Jenny she had known back since her first year being a maidservant. No longer Jane could see two noise sisters of hers who always skipped work to gossip, only two sets of dead eyes left, seeing her but not with greeting eyes, almost like strangers.

“Welcome,” Emeralda greeted with a flat tone.

“Welcome,” the other girl repeated. No enthusiasm could be hear within their voices, as if they were greeting a stranger before them. 

Jane didn’t expect this. Six months of serving in this damned mansion indeed could change gossip friends into strangers. Even when she tried to strike a conversation what replied her were business-like formal speech. In the end, the only thing Jane could do was pretend to be busy helping the quiet steward unload the carriage.

Both Jenny and Emeralda probably were chosen to welcome her because their familiarity with each other. At least, when they noticed her was there. There were one other maidservant and one old nanny beside them, whom, when Jane tried to greet them, didn’t even bat an eye and continued to be busy sweeping a clean place instead.

“Listen, you,” the quiet steward approached Jane after he done unloading supplies and about to return back to the city, “I will come back one week after this to replenish the kitchen. If you’ve got any questions, ask them directly to the old nanny who’s taking care of the young lady. Other maidservants are occupied. It’s best for you not to disturb them when they are busy.”

“Yes,” Jane replied, said nothing else. There was nothing she could say anyway, especially when she saw the usually lazy friends of hers became strangers and suspiciously diligent instead--they were so diligent that they spent the afternoon circling the yard looking for hidden dry leaves to sweep.
